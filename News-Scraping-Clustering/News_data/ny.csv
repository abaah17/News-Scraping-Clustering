"Driver Rams Into Officers at Capitol, Killing One and Injuring Another",politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/us/politics/capitol-attack.html,"WASHINGTON — The band of razor wire-topped fencing around the Capitol had recently come down. The heavy National Guard presence had begun to thin. But on Friday, not quite three months after the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, a car came careening midday onto the Capitol grounds, slamming into two Capitol Police officers and leaving one of them dead and the other injured. This time, the source of the violence was not an angry pro-Trump mob, but a lone driver, armed with a knife, who had recently told friends he had left his job and had “afflictions.” After crashing his car and menacing officers, he was shot and killed. “It is with a very, very heavy heart that I announce one of our officers has succumbed to his injuries,” Yogananda D. Pittman, the acting Capitol Police chief, said during a news conference near the scene. “This has been an extremely difficult time for U.S. Capitol Police, after the events of Jan. 6 and now the events that have occurred here today.” The attacker “exited the vehicle with a knife in hand” and began “lunging” at the officers, Ms. Pittman said. The suspect was subsequently identified by a senior law enforcement official as Noah R. Green, 25. Investigators said they did not know a motive, but did not believe it was “terrorism related,” Robert J. Contee, the acting chief of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, told reporters. Congress was not in session on Friday, as lawmakers were scattered around the country for the holiday weekend. Chief Contee said that it appeared the driver had not been previously known to his agency or to the Capitol Police. On the driver’s Facebook page, which has since been taken down, Mr. Green described himself as a supporter of the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and said he had been struggling through the last few months of the pandemic. He said he had recently left his job and been “faced with fear, hunger, loss of wealth and diminution of fruit.” The police identified the dead officer as William Evans, an 18-year member of the force. Officer Evans was the second member of the force to die in the line of duty this year; another, Brian D. Sicknick, died from injuries suffered during the Jan. 6 attack, while a third died by suicide in its aftermath. Nearly 140 officers were injured that day. The second officer struck by the car on Friday was said to be in stable condition at a nearby hospital. President Biden ordered flags at the White House to be flown at half-staff in honor of Officer Evans, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered the same at the Capitol complex. “We send our heartfelt condolences to Officer Evans’s family, and everyone grieving his loss,” Mr. Biden, who served in the Senate for 36 years, said in a statement. “We know what a difficult time this has been for the Capitol, everyone who works there, and those who protect it.” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader,   would “go down in history for his selfless sacrifice.” The violence came on a quiet afternoon just as the Capitol had seemed to be getting back to normal after the trauma of Jan. 6, the most violent attack on the Capitol in two centuries, and months of heightened security measures. In a matter of minutes on Friday, the entire complex was put on lockdown for over an hour, as reporters and Capitol staff members were left to press up against windows to catch sight of the unfolding chaos with little information about the scale of the threat. A helicopter swept across the plaza in front of the Capitol, landing only feet away from the building. At least one of the officers was medevacked to a hospital, according to law enforcement officials, and a National Guard quick-response team and the local police were on hand at the already heavily fortified complex. The Capitol Police had only recently removed a perimeter fence topped with razor wire that had been put in place to foil follow-up attacks after the riot, and reopened streets around the building. On Friday afternoon, officers rushed to put the entire Capitol building on lockdown and re-close Constitution Avenue. For hours after the crash, the blue sedan remained wedged against the barricade, which protects the driveway that senators use daily when Congress is in session to drive to and from the Capitol. It was towed late Friday afternoon. But lawmakers said the attack was a reminder that the Capitol is still not secure. “This rips the scab off, and continues to provide a level of uncertainty and worry about the workplace and what’s happened there,” Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio and the leader of a subcommittee that funds the Capitol Police, said at a news conference. “This is very personal for so many of us.” The motivation of the suspect remained a mystery. On Facebook, Mr. Green had posted speeches and articles written by Mr. Farrakhan and Elijah Muhammad, who led the Nation of Islam from 1934 to 1975, that discussed the decline of the United States. Two law enforcement officials confirmed that the Facebook page, which was taken down on Friday, had belonged to Mr. Green. He had posted on Facebook about his personal struggles, especially during the pandemic. “To be honest, these past few years have been tough, and these past few months have been tougher,” he wrote. “I have been tried with some of the biggest, unimaginable tests in my life. I am currently now unemployed, after I left my job, partly due to afflictions.” He also spoke on Facebook about the “end times” and the Antichrist. On March 17, he posted a photograph of a donation he had made to the Norfolk, Va., chapter of the Nation of Islam, along with a video of a Mr. Farrakhan speech titled, “The Divine Destruction of America.” Later that day, he encouraged his friends to join him in studying the teachings of Mr. Farrakhan and Mr. Muhammad. The Nation of Islam is a Black nationalist movement that has advocated African-American self-sufficiency. It has been condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center for “the deeply racist, anti-Semitic and anti-gay rhetoric of its leaders,” including Mr. Farrakhan. Mr. Green was born in West Virginia, attended high school in Virginia, then enrolled in Glenville State College, where he played football before transferring to Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Va. He played defensive back on the Christopher Newport football team and graduated in 2019 with a degree in finance. The attack was a worrisome sign that since Jan. 6, the Capitol has become a magnet for angry or disturbed people. For the Capitol Police and the lawmakers, it will complicate a top-to-bottom security review already underway and debates over how Congress should balance security and public access to the Capitol. Top congressional leaders dismissed all of Congress’s top security officers in the days after the January riot and have begun hearings and investigations to better understand what happened and what is needed to keep the Capitol complex safe going forward.  appointed by Ms. Pelosi and led by Lt. Gen. Russel L. Honoré has recommended hiring more than 800 Capitol Police officers, developing mobile fencing around the complex and changing the opaque board that oversees the police force to allow the chief of the agency to quickly summon the National Guard during an emergency. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III approved more than 2,200 National Guard troops to remain in Washington through May 23, and Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, hired former military leaders to be in charge of each chamber’s security. But many members — particularly Republicans —  , and the Capitol Police have begun taking down some of the security fencing around the outer perimeter of the complex, easing up on checkpoints and allowing cars to drive closer to the halls of Congress. Some Democrats said that Friday’s events had confirmed their fears that easing security too soon could leave the grounds vulnerable to attack. “I recognize that the fence is a disturbance,” Mr. Ryan said. “It’s an eyesore. It sucks. Nobody wants that. But the question is, is the environment safe enough to be able to take it down?” He said that lawmakers were exploring the security practices at other capitals — including a call with Israeli officials about how they protect the Knesset — as part of potential permanent security changes on the complex. “I think everything is going to be re-evaluated after today,” he said.

U.S. Taps Johnson & Johnson to Run Troubled Vaccine Plant,politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/emergent-vaccine-plant-johnson-johnson.html,"WASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Saturday put Johnson & Johnson in charge of a troubled Baltimore manufacturing plant that ruined 15 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine and moved to stop the plant from making another vaccine by AstraZeneca, senior federal health officials said. The extraordinary move by the Department of Health and Human Services came just days after officials had learned that Emergent BioSolutions, a contract manufacturer that has been making both the Johnson & Johnson and the AstraZeneca vaccines, mixed up ingredients from the two, which led regulators to delay authorization of the plant’s production lines. By moving the AstraZeneca vaccine out, two senior federal health officials said, the plant can be solely devoted to the Johnson & Johnson single-dose vaccine and avoid future mishaps. The Department of Health and Human Services directed Johnson & Johnson to install a new leadership team to oversee all aspects of production and manufacturing at the Emergent Baltimore plant, the officials said. The company said in a statement that it was “assuming full responsibility” for the vaccine made at the Emergent plant. With President Biden making an aggressive push to have enough doses to cover every adult by the end of May, federal officials are worried that the mix-up will erode public confidence in Covid-19 vaccines. The AstraZeneca vaccine in particular has generated safety concerns; Germany, France and other European nations briefly suspended its use after reports of rare brain blood clots in some vaccine recipients. The ingredient mix-up, and Saturday’s move by the administration, is a significant setback and a public relations debacle for Emergent, a Maryland-based biotech company that has built a profitable business by teaming up with the federal government, primarily by   to the Strategic National Stockpile. A spokesman for Emergent declined to comment, except to say that the company would continue making AstraZeneca doses until it received a contract modification from the federal government. Unlike Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca does not yet have emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for its vaccine. With three federally authorized vaccines (the other two are by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna), it is not clear whether the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has had a troubled history with regulators, could even be cleared in time to meet U.S. needs. However, one of the federal officials said the Department of Health and Human Services was discussing working with AstraZeneca to adapt its vaccine to combat new coronavirus variants. AstraZeneca said in a statement that it would work with the Biden administration to find a new site to manufacture its vaccine. So far, none of the Johnson & Johnson doses made by Emergent have been released by the F.D.A. for distribution. Officials have said it may take weeks to sort out whether other batches of vaccine were contaminated and for F.D.A. inspectors to determine whether the Emergent plant can be cleared to release any doses that it has made. The acting F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock, said in a statement on Saturday that the agency “takes its responsibility for helping to ensure the quality of manufacturing of vaccines and other medical products for use during this pandemic very seriously.” But she made it clear that the ultimate responsibility would rest with Johnson & Johnson, saying: “It is important to note that even when companies use contract manufacturing organizations, it is ultimately the responsibility of the company that holds the emergency use authorization to ensure that the quality standards of the FDA are met.” In another arrangement   last month, Johnson & Johnson is now working with Merck, one of the world’s biggest vaccine manufacturers. Officials said Merck would help with management of the Baltimore plant. Emergent’s Baltimore plant is one of two that are federally designated as “Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing” and were built with taxpayer support. Last June, the government paid   to reserve space there as part of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s fast-track initiative to develop coronavirus vaccines. Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca both contracted with Emergent to use the space. Both vaccines are so-called live viral-vector vaccines, meaning they use a modified, harmless version of a different virus as a vector, or carrier, to deliver instructions to the body’s immune system. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is administered in one dose, AstraZeneca’s in two doses. Experts in vaccine manufacturing said that in the past, the F.D.A. had a rule to prevent such mishaps by not allowing a plant to make two live viral vector vaccines, because of the potential for mix-ups and contamination. Last month, Mr. Biden canceled a visit to Emergent’s Baltimore plant, and his spokeswoman announced that the administration would conduct an audit of the Strategic National Stockpile, the nation’s emergency medical reserve. Both actions came after a   into how the company had gained outsize influence over the repository."
Kemp Lashes M.L.B. as Republicans Defend Georgia’s Voting Law,politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/mlb-georgia-voting-kemp.html,"Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia on Saturday issued a blistering critique of Major League Baseball’s decision to   over the new law there restricting voting, arguing that the move would deliver an economic hit to Georgians. Mr. Kemp, a Republican, framed the battle over voting rights in Georgia as a wholly partisan one concocted by Democrats, rather than a civil rights effort to protect access to the ballot as Republicans   across the country. “Yesterday, Major League Baseball caved to fear and lies from liberal activists,” Mr. Kemp said at a news conference, flanked by the state’s Republican attorney general, G.O.P. members of the legislature and grass-roots activists. “In the middle of a pandemic, Major League Baseball put the wishes of Stacey Abrams and Joe Biden ahead of the economic well-being of hard-working Georgians who were counting on the All-Star Game for a paycheck.” The governor peppered his speech with conservative catchphrases like “cancel culture,” underscoring how Republicans are seeking to make access to voting a wedge issue that they can wrap into   that animate the base of the party. Mr. Kemp, who is gearing up to run for re-election in 2022, has striven to re-enter the good graces of Republican voters after becoming a central political target of former President Donald J. Trump because of his refusal to help Mr. Trump overturn the state’s election results last year. A former secretary of state of Georgia who has his own record of decisions that made voting harder for the state’s residents, he is again a key G.O.P. voice leading the charge on the issue. On Saturday, he repeatedly tried to paint the league’s decision as driven by Stacey Abrams, the voting rights advocate and former Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia who is seen as likely to challenge Mr. Kemp again next year. Ms. Abrams, one of the most prominent critics of Georgia’s voting law, has pushed back on calls for sports leagues and corporations to boycott the state. She said on Friday that she was “disappointed” baseball officials had pulled the All-Star Game but that she was “proud of their stance on voting rights.” In defending the law in Georgia, Mr. Kemp singled out two Democratically controlled states, New York and Delaware, and compared their voting regulations with the new law in Georgia. Those states do not offer as many options for early voting as Georgia does, but they have also not passed new laws instituting restrictions on voting. “In New York, they have 10 days of early voting,” Mr. Kemp said (New York  ). “In Georgia, we have a minimum of 17, with two additional Sundays that are optional in our state. In New York, you have to have an excuse to vote absentee. In Georgia, you can vote absentee for any reason.” Mr. Kemp’s news conference followed a week of television appearances in which he has staunchly defended the law, arguing that it expands access to voting because of an extra required Saturday of early voting. He and other Republicans have denounced criticism of the law as a political game by state and national Democratic leaders. (The New York Times reviewed the voting law and   that could hamper voting access or the nonpartisan administration of elections.) The decision to move the All-Star Game was the first major statement by a leading organization or business since Georgia passed its voting law, and came amid a growing chorus of corporate statements denouncing the legislation after it had already been signed. Delta and Coca-Cola, two of the state’s largest corporations,  , stating sternly that they were against the law. “I want to be crystal clear,” James Quincey, the chief executive of Coca-Cola, said on Wednesday. “The Coca-Cola Company does not support this legislation, as it makes it harder for people to vote, not easier.” Big companies and Major League Baseball had  ,   and faith leaders who wanted to see important American institutions take a stronger stance against the voting law in Georgia, as well as similar Republican efforts now advancing in states around the country. In response to the companies that have spoken out, Republicans including Mr. Trump have called for a boycott. “Don’t go back to their products until they relent,” the former president urged in a statement on Saturday night, naming companies including Delta and Coca-Cola. “We can play the game better than them.”  Mr. Kemp challenged Major League Baseball to consider what it might do if the Atlanta Braves made the playoffs. “What are they going to do if the Braves make the playoffs?” he said. “Are they going to move the damn playoff game?” And he said that more event changes or boycotts would not prompt him to reconsider the law or support any adjustments to it. Promising that he was “not wavering,” Mr. Kemp said, “For anybody that’s out there thinking that any kind of snowball effect is going to have an effect on me, it will not.”"
How Trump Steered Supporters Into Unwitting Donations,politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/trump-donations.html,"Stacy Blatt was in hospice care last September listening to Rush Limbaugh’s dire warnings about how badly Donald J. Trump’s campaign needed money when he went online and chipped in everything he could: $500. It was a big sum for a 63-year-old battling cancer and living in Kansas City on less than $1,000 per month. But that single contribution — federal records show it was his first ever — quickly multiplied. Another $500 was withdrawn the next day, then $500 the next week and every week through mid-October, without his knowledge — until Mr. Blatt’s bank account had been depleted and frozen. When his utility and rent payments bounced, he called his brother, Russell, for help. What the Blatts soon discovered was $3,000 in withdrawals by the Trump campaign in less than 30 days. They called their bank and said they thought they were victims of fraud. “It felt,” Russell said, “like it was a scam.” But what the Blatts believed was duplicity was actually an intentional scheme to boost revenues by the Trump campaign and the for-profit company that processed its online donations, WinRed. Facing   and getting badly outspent by the Democrats, the campaign had begun last September to set up recurring donations by default for online donors, for every week until the election. Contributors had to wade through a fine-print disclaimer and manually uncheck a box to opt out. As the election neared, the Trump team made that disclaimer increasingly opaque, an investigation by The New York Times showed. It introduced a second prechecked box, known internally as a “money bomb,” that doubled a person’s contribution. Eventually its solicitations featured lines of text in bold and capital letters that overwhelmed the opt-out language. The tactic ensnared scores of unsuspecting Trump loyalists — retirees, military veterans, nurses and even experienced political operatives. Soon, banks and credit card companies were inundated with fraud complaints from the president’s own supporters about donations they had not intended to make, sometimes for thousands of dollars. “Bandits!” said Victor Amelino, a 78-year-old Californian, who made a $990 online donation to Mr. Trump in early September via WinRed. It recurred seven more times — adding up to almost $8,000. “I’m retired. I can’t afford to pay all that damn money.” The sheer magnitude of the money involved is staggering for politics. In the final two and a half months of 2020, the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee and their shared accounts issued more than 530,000 refunds worth $64.3 million to online donors. All campaigns make refunds for various reasons, including to people who give more than the legal limit. But the sum the Trump operation refunded dwarfed that of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign and his equivalent Democratic committees, which made 37,000 online refunds totaling $5.6 million in that time. The recurring donations swelled Mr. Trump’s treasury in September and October, just as his finances were deteriorating. He was then able to use tens of millions of dollars he raised after the election, under the guise of fighting his unfounded fraud claims, to help cover the refunds he owed. In effect, the money that Mr. Trump eventually had to refund amounted to an interest-free loan from unwitting supporters at the most important juncture of the 2020 race. Marketers have long used ruses like prechecked boxes to steer American consumers into unwanted purchases, like magazine subscriptions. But consumer advocates said deploying the practice on voters in the heat of a presidential campaign — at such volume and with withdrawals every week — had much more serious ramifications. “It’s unfair, it’s unethical and it’s inappropriate,” said Ira Rheingold, the executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. Harry Brignull, a user-experience designer in London who coined the term “dark patterns” for manipulative digital marketing practices, said the Trump team’s techniques were a classic of the “deceptive design” genre. “It should be in textbooks of what you shouldn’t do,” he said. Political strategists, digital operatives and campaign finance experts said they could not recall ever seeing refunds at such a scale. Mr. Trump, the R.N.C. and their shared accounts refunded far more money to online donors in the last election cycle than every federal Democratic candidate and committee in the country combined. Over all, the Trump operation refunded 10.7 percent of the money it raised on WinRed in 2020; the Biden operation’s refund rate on ActBlue, the parallel Democratic online donation-processing platform, was 2.2 percent, federal records show. Several bank representatives who fielded fraud claims directly from consumers estimated that WinRed cases, at their peak, represented as much as 1 to 3 percent of their workload. An executive for one of the nation’s larger credit-card issuers confirmed that WinRed at its height accounted for a similar percentage of its formal disputes. That figure may seem small at first glance, but financial experts said it was a shockingly large percentage, considering that political donations represent a tiny fraction of the overall United States economy. In its investigation, The Times reviewed filings with the Federal Election Commission from the Trump and Biden campaigns and their shared accounts with political parties, as well as the donation-processing sites ActBlue and WinRed, compiling a database of refunds issued by day. The Times also interviewed two dozen Trump donors who made recurring donations, as well as campaign officials, campaign finance experts and consumer advocates. Nearly a dozen bank and credit card officials from the nation’s leading financial institutions spoke for this article on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. A clear pattern emerged. Donors typically said they intended to give once or twice and only later discovered on their bank statements and credit card bills that they were donating over and over again. Some, like Mr. Blatt, who died of cancer in February, sought an injunction from their banks and credit cards. Others pursued refunds directly from WinRed, which typically granted them to avoid more costly formal disputes. WinRed said that every donor receives at least one follow-up email about pending repeat donations in advance and that the company makes it “exceptionally easy,” with 24-hour customer service, for people to request their money back. “WinRed wants donors to be happy, and puts a premium on customer support,” said Gerrit Lansing, WinRed’s president. “Donors are the lifeblood of G.O.P. campaigns.” He noted that Democrats and ActBlue had also used recurring programs. Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, downplayed the rash of fraud complaints and the $122.7 million in total refunds issued by the Trump operation. He said internal records showed that 0.87 percent of its WinRed transactions had been subject to formal credit card disputes. “The fact we had a dispute rate of less than 1 percent of total donations despite raising more grass-roots money than any campaign in history is remarkable,” he said. That still amounts to about 200,000 disputed transactions that Mr. Miller said added up to $19.7 million. “Our campaign was built by the hardworking men and women of America,” Mr. Miller said, “and cherishing their investments was paramount to anything else we did.” Asked if Mr. Trump had been aware of his operation’s use of recurring payments, the campaign did not respond. Mr. Trump’s hyperaggressive fund-raising practices did not stop once he lost the election. His campaign continued the weekly withdrawals through prechecked boxes all the way through Dec. 14 as he raised tens of millions of dollars for his new political action committee, Save America. In March, Mr. Trump   to send their money to him — and not to the traditional party apparatus — making plain that he intends to remain the gravitational center of Republican fund-raising online. The small and bright yellow box popped up on Mr. Trump’s digital donation portal around  . The text was boldface, simple and straightforward: “Make this a monthly recurring donation.” The box came prefilled with a check mark. Even that was more aggressive than what the Biden campaign would do in 2020. Biden officials said they rarely used prechecked boxes to automatically have donations recur monthly or weekly; the exception was on landing pages where advertisements and emails had explicitly asked supporters to become repeat donors. But for Mr. Trump, the prechecked monthly box was just the beginning. By June, the campaign and the R.N.C. were experimenting with a second prechecked box, to default donors into making an additional contribution — called the money bomb. An early test arrived in the run-up to Mr. Trump’s birthday, June 14. The results were tantalizing: That date, a seemingly random Sunday, became the biggest day for online donations in the campaign’s history. Ronna McDaniel, the R.N.C. chairwoman,   about the achievement without mentioning how exactly the party had pulled it off. “Republicans are thinking smarter digitally,” she said, and were poised to “outwork, outdo, and outmaneuver the Democrats at every turn.” The two prechecked yellow boxes would be a fixture for the rest of the campaign. And so would a much larger volume of refunds. Until then, the Biden and Trump operations had nearly identical refund rates on WinRed and ActBlue in 2020: 2.18 percent for Mr. Trump and 2.17 percent for Mr. Biden. But from the day after Mr. Trump’s birthday through the rest of the year, Mr. Biden’s refund rate remained nearly flat, at 2.24 percent, while Mr. Trump’s soared to 12.29 percent. In early September — just after learning that it had been outraised by the Biden operation in August by more than $150 million — the Trump campaign became even more aggressive. It changed the language in the first yellow box to withdraw recurring donations every week instead of every month. Suddenly, some contributors were unwittingly making as many as half a dozen donations in 30 days: the intended contribution, the “money bomb” and four more weekly withdrawals. “You don’t realize it until after everything is already in motion,” said Bruce Turner, 72, of Gilbert, Ariz., whose wife’s $1,000 donation in early October became $6,000 by Election Day. They were refunded $5,000 the week after the election, records show. Around the same time, officials who fielded fraud claims at bank and credit card companies noticed a surge in complaints against the Trump campaign and WinRed. “It started to go absolutely wild,” said one fraud investigator with Wells Fargo. “It just became a pattern,” said another at Capital One. A consumer representative for USAA, which primarily serves military families, recalled an older veteran who discovered repeated WinRed charges from donating to Mr. Trump only after calling to have his balance read to him by phone. The unintended payments busted credit card limits. Some donors canceled their cards to avoid recurring payments. Others paid overdraft fees to their bank. All the banking officials said they recalled only a negligible number of complaints against ActBlue, the Democratic donation platform, although there are online review sites that feature heated complaints about unwanted charges and customer service. The Trump operation was not done modifying the yellow boxes. Soon, the fact that donations would be withdrawn weekly was taken out of boldface type, according to archived versions of the president’s website, and moved beneath other bold text. As the campaign’s financial problems became increasingly acute, the yellow boxes became dizzyingly more complex. By October there were sometimes nine lines of boldface text — with ALL-CAPS words sprinkled in — before the disclosure that there would be weekly withdrawals. As many as eight more lines of boldface text came before the second additional donation disclaimer. Even political professionals fell prey to the boxes. Jeff Kropf, the executive director of the Oregon Capitol Watch Foundation, a conservative group, said he had been “very careful” to uncheck recurring boxes — yet he missed the “money bomb” and got a second charge anyway. “Until WinRed fixes their sneaky way of adding additional contributions to credit cards like they did to me, I won’t use them again,” he said. Mr. Brignull, the user-experience designer who also serves as an expert witness in legal cases involving misleading advertising, noted that a Consumer Rights Directive in Europe prohibits companies from deploying a defaulted opt-in tactic for recurring payments. “It is very easy for the eye to skip over,” he said. “The only really meaningful information in that box is buried.” By last summer, the Biden campaign had begun outraising Mr. Trump’s team, and the president was hopping mad. For months, years even, his advisers had been telling him how he had built a one-of-a-kind financial juggernaut. So why, Mr. Trump demanded to know, was he off the television airwaves just months before the election in critical battleground states like Michigan? “Where did all the money go?” he would lash out, according to two senior advisers. Inside the Trump re-election headquarters in Northern Virginia, the pressure was building to wring ever more money out of his supporters. Perhaps nowhere was that pressure more acute than on Mr. Trump’s expansive and lucrative digital operation. That was the unquestioned domain of Gary Coby, a 30-something strategist whose title — digital director — and microscopic public profile belied his immense influence on the Trump operation, especially online. A veteran of the R.N.C. and the 2016 race, Mr. Coby had the confidence, trust and respect of Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, who unofficially oversaw the 2020 campaign, according to people familiar with the campaign’s operations. Mr. Kushner and the rest of the campaign leadership gave Mr. Coby, whose talents are recognized across the Republican digital industry, wide latitude to raise money however he saw fit. That meant almost endless optimization and experimentation, sometimes pushing the traditional boundaries. The Trump team repeatedly used phantom donation matches and faux deadlines to loosen donor wallets (“1000% offer: ACTIVATED…For the NEXT HOUR”). Eventually it ratcheted up the volume of emails it sent until it was barraging supporters with an average of 15 per day for all of October and November 2020. Mr. Coby, who declined an interview request for this article, outlined his philosophical approach when offering advice to other ambitious young strategists after he was named to the American Association of Political Consultants’   in 2017: “Asking for forgiveness is easier than permission.” Mr. Coby’s partner in fund-raising was Mr. Lansing, the president of WinRed, which had been created in 2019 as a centralized platform for G.O.P. digital contributions after prominent Republicans feared they were falling irreparably behind Democrats and ActBlue. The Trump and WinRed operations had been closely aligned since the platform’s inception — Mr. Trump reportedly helped come up with   — and the president’s re-election operation amounted to a majority of all of WinRed’s business last cycle, when it processed more than $2 billion. Inside the Trump orbit, “Gary and Gerrit” became something of a shorthand term for Mr. Coby and Mr. Lansing, according to multiple senior Trump campaign and White House officials. The two strategists were already well acquainted: They had worked together at the R.N.C. in 2016, when Mr. Lansing oversaw its digital operations and Mr. Coby was the director of advertising. And they were business partners in Opn Sesame, a text messaging platform, which Mr. Lansing co-founded and served as chief operating officer for; WinRed said he stepped away from its day-to-day operations in early 2019. Top Trump officials said they did not know specifically who had conceived of using the weekly recurring prechecked boxes — or who had designed them in the increasingly complex blizzard of text. But they said virtually all online fund-raising decisions were a “Gary and Gerrit” production. “The campaigns determine their own fund-raising strategies and make their own decisions on how to use these tools,” Mr. Lansing said in WinRed’s statement. Unlike ActBlue, which is a nonprofit, WinRed is a for-profit company. It makes its money by taking 30 cents of every donation, plus 3.8 percent of the amount given. WinRed was paid more than $118 million from federal committees the last election cycle; even after paying credit card fees and expenses like payroll and rent, the profits are believed to be significant. WinRed even made money off donations that were refunded by keeping the fees it charged on each transaction, a practice it said was standard in the industry, citing PayPal; ActBlue said it does not keep fees for refunded donations. WinRed’s cut of the Trump operation’s refunds would amount to roughly $5 million before expenses. (Archived versions of WinRed’s website show it added a disclaimer saying it would keep its fees around when refunds surged.) There is another reason Mr. Trump’s refund rates were so high: His campaign accepted millions of dollars above the legal cap, a problem exacerbated by recurring donations. A pianist in New York, for instance, contributed more than 100 times in the months leading up to Election Day, going far past the legal limit of $2,800. She was refunded $87,716.50 — three weeks after Election Day. While every large-scale campaign winds up accepting and returning some donations above the legal limit, including Mr. Biden’s, the Trump situation stands out. Records show that Mr. Biden’s campaign committee issued roughly $47,000 in refunds larger than $5,000 after Election Day; Mr. Trump’s campaign issued more than $7 million. Trump officials attributed the excessive donations to enthusiastic supporters and said the surge in postelection complaints was a result of losing the election, not of the recurring donation tactics. The use of prechecked boxes is not unprecedented in politics, and WinRed said it was simply adopting tactics that ActBlue put in place years ago. ActBlue said in a statement that it had begun to phase out prechecked recurring boxes “unless groups were explicitly asking for recurring contributions.” Some prominent Democratic groups, including both congressional campaign committees, continue to precheck recurring boxes regardless of that guidance. Still, Democratic refund rates were only a small fraction of the Trump campaign’s last year. Republicans widely hailed WinRed as one of the standout successes of the 2020 cycle, and in a memo last October the company declared itself the “trusted, recognizable platform” for Republican giving. “Scam PACs, shady operators and outright fraud is unfortunately a common occurrence in the online political donation world — particularly on the right,” the memo stated. “WinRed helps civilize the Wild West of the G.O.P. donation ecosystem.” But for some Trump supporters like Ron Wilson, WinRed is a scam artist. Mr. Wilson, an 87-year-old retiree in Illinois, made a series of small contributions last fall that he thought would add up to about $200; by December, federal records show, WinRed and Mr. Trump’s committees had withdrawn more than 70 separate donations from Mr. Wilson worth roughly $2,300. “Predatory!” Mr. Wilson said of WinRed. Like multiple other donors interviewed, though, he held Mr. Trump himself blameless, telling The Times, “I’m 100 percent loyal to Donald Trump.” All told, the Trump and party operation raised $1.2 billion on WinRed, and refunded roughly 10 percent of it. Whatever blowback it received, WinRed was not deterred. Soon after the November election ended, the two Republican Senate incumbents in Georgia, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, deployed prechecked weekly recurring boxes in advance of their January runoffs. Predictably, refund rates spiked. Keith Millhouse, a transportation consultant in California, intended to donate once to Mr. Perdue, with the aim of keeping Republicans in control of the Senate. He wound up a recurring contributor and called the practice “repugnant” and “deceptive.” “I’m busy like a lot of other people during this Covid era and I just wanted to get in, make a donation, get done and move on to what I needed to do next,” he said. “I thought I had done that. Then I find out that, you know, I’m getting these other charges.” He canceled the repeating charge when he saw the reminder email. But by then WinRed had already processed his second $100 “bonus” contribution. He figured it was not worth the hassle to protest. “Don’t try to sucker it out of me,” he said. In the final 2020 reporting period, from Nov. 24 through the end of the year, Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler refunded $4.8 million to WinRed donors — more than triple the amount refunded by their Democratic rivals via ActBlue, even though the Democrats had raised far more money online. The refunds have stretched into 2021 and have been a source of frustration for the Loeffler campaign, according to a person familiar with the matter. Now WinRed is exporting the tools it pioneered during the Trump re-election across the Republican Party, presaging a new normal for G.O.P. campaigns. Today, the websites of various Republican Party committees and top congressional Republicans, including Representative  , the House minority leader, and Senator  , the Senate minority leader, include prechecked yellow boxes for multiple or recurring donations. And after Mr. Trump’s first public speech of his post-presidency at the end of February, his new political operation sent its first text message to supporters since he left the White House. “Did you miss me?” he asked. The message directed supporters to a WinRed donation page with two prechecked yellow boxes. Mr. Trump raised $3 million that day, according to an adviser, with more to come from the recurring donations in the months ahead.

Her Ballot Didn’t Count. She Faces 5 Years in Prison for Casting It.,politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/texas-provisional-ballot-appeal.html,"On Election Day 2016, Crystal Mason went to vote after her mother insisted that she make her voice heard in the presidential election. When her name didn’t appear on official voting rolls at her polling place in Tarrant County, Texas, she filled out a provisional ballot, not thinking anything of it. Ms. Mason’s ballot was   because she was ineligible to vote: She was on supervised release after serving five years for tax fraud. Nonetheless, that ballot has wrangled her into a lengthy appeals process after a state district court sentenced her to five years in prison for illegal voting, as she was a felon on probation when she cast her ballot. Ms. Mason maintains that she didn’t know she was ineligible to vote. “This is very overwhelming, waking up every day knowing that prison is on the line, trying to maintain a smile on your face in front of your kids and you don’t know the outcome,” Ms. Mason said in a phone interview. “Your future is in someone else’s hands because of a simple error.” Her case is now headed for the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the highest state court for criminal cases, whose judges said on Wednesday that they had decided to hear it. Ms. Mason unsuccessfully   and lost her case in an appellate court. This new appeal is the last chance for Ms. Mason, 46, who is out on appeal bond, to avoid prison. If her case has to advance to the federal court system, Ms. Mason would have to appeal from a cell. Alison Grinter, one of Ms. Mason’s lawyers, said the federal government made it clear in the   that provisional ballots should not be criminalized because they represent “an offer to vote — they’re not a vote in themselves.” She said that Ms. Mason didn’t know she was ineligible and was still convicted, and that Texas’ election laws stipulate that a person must knowingly vote illegally to be guilty of a crime. “Crystal never wanted to be a voting rights advocate,” Ms. Grinter said Thursday. “She didn’t want to be a political football here. She just wanted to be a mom and a grandmother and put her life on track, but she’s really taken it and run with it, and she refuses to be intimidated.” A Tarrant County grand jury indicted Ms. Mason for a violation of the Texas election laws, a spokeswoman for the Tarrant County Criminal District Attorney’s Office said in a statement. “Our office offered Mason the option of probation in this case, which she refused,” the statement said. “Mason waived a trial by jury and chose to proceed to trial before the trial judge.” In March 2018, Judge Ruben Gonzalez of Texas’ 432nd District Court found Ms. Mason guilty of a second-degree felony for illegally voting. According to Tommy Buser-Clancy, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, Ms. Mason should never have never been convicted. If there is ambiguity in someone’s eligibility, the provisional ballot system is there to account for it, he said. “That’s very scary,” he said of Ms. Mason’s conviction, “and it guts the entire purpose of the provisional ballot system.” If her eligibility was incorrect, he said, “that should be the end of the story.” The appeals court’s decision could set an important precedent for the future of how the public interprets voting, especially if they’re confused, according to Joseph R. Fishkin, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin. He said he hoped that the court establishes a principle not to “criminalize people for being confused about the complexities of the interaction between the criminal law and election law.” Professor Fishkin said that he and many other law experts believe that if the court upholds Ms. Mason’s conviction, the state would be in direct conflict with the federal Help America Vote Act. “It’s very important for basic fairness and for participation around the country that people are confident that when they act in good faith and aren’t trying to pull a fast one, that you’re not going to start charging them for crimes,” Professor Fishkin said Thursday. “If this case stands, that’s obviously concerning, because a lot of people who may not understand the details of their status or who is allowed to vote will be deterred from voting.” Across the United States, 5.2 million Americans cannot vote because of a prior felony conviction, according to  , a research organization dedicated to crime and punishment. The office of the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, said that   have been prosecuted since 2004. The outcomes of those cases were not immediately available. At least 72 percent of Mr. Paxton’s voter fraud cases have targeted people of color, according to  . Ms. Mason’s cause has received support from the  , a libertarian think tank. Clark Neily, a senior vice president for criminal justice at the institute, said the case represented an example of excessive criminalization. “It’s putting people in a position where they can commit a criminal offense without even knowing that they’re in violation of any law,” he said. Celina Stewart, chief counsel at the League of Women Voters, which has filed   on Ms. Mason’s behalf, said her case sent “a very clear message” that people with felony convictions should be cautious. “She’s being made an example, and the example is that you don’t want returning citizens, Black people, Black women to vote,” she said. “That’s an egregious narrative, and we have to push back on that because that’s not how democracy works.”"
"Georgia’s Election Law, and Why Turnout Isn’t Easy to Turn Off",politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/upshot/georgia-election-law-turnout.html,"There’s nothing unusual about exaggeration in politics. But when it comes to the debate over voting rights, something more than exaggeration is going on. There’s a real — and bipartisan — misunderstanding about whether making it easier or harder to vote, especially by mail, has a significant effect on turnout or electoral outcomes. The evidence suggests it does not. The fight over the new Georgia election law is only the latest example. That law,  , has been condemned by Democrats as voter suppression, or even as tantamount to Jim Crow. Democrats are understandably concerned about a provision that empowers the Republican-controlled State Legislature to play a larger role in election administration. That provision has uncertain but potentially substantial effects, depending on what the Legislature might do in the future. And it’s possible the law is intended to do exactly what progressives fear: reshape the electorate to the advantage of Republicans, soon after an electoral defeat, by making it harder to vote. And yet the law’s voting provisions are unlikely to significantly affect turnout or Democratic chances. It could plausibly even increase turnout. In the final account, it will probably be hard to say whether it had any effect on turnout at all. The  , but the bill’s major effects can be boiled down to a few points: If we leave aside the administrative provisions and the question of intent, the core question on voter suppression is to what extent does reducing voting options — like early voting in the runoffs or mail voting in general — reduce turnout and Democratic chances? For decades, reformers have assumed that the way to increase turnout is to make voting easier. Yet surprisingly, expanding voting options to make it more convenient hasn’t seemed to have a huge effect on turnout or electoral outcomes. That’s the finding of decades of political science research on  ,   and   voting. One prominent study even found that early voting  , though that’s a bit of an outlier. There’s essentially no evidence that the vast expansion of no-excuse absentee mail voting, in which anyone can apply for a mail absentee ballot, had any discernible effect on turnout in 2020. That shouldn’t be a huge surprise: Even universal vote by mail, in which every registered voter is automatically sent a mail ballot (as opposed to every voter having an opportunity to apply for one), increases turnout   with no discernible partisan advantage. Believe it or not, turnout increased just as much in the states that didn’t have no-excuse absentee voting as it did in the states that added it for the first time. Similarly, Joe Biden improved over Hillary Clinton’s performance by three percentage points in the states that added it, compared with 2.9 points in the states that did not. A   by political scientists at Stanford found that no-excuse mail voting might have increased turnout by a whopping 0.02 percent in the 2020 election. The study used a novel approach: The researchers compared the turnout among 65-year-olds in Texas, who were eligible to vote by mail without an excuse, with 64-year-olds in Texas, who weren’t. The turnout among 64-year-olds was indistinguishable from that of 65-year-olds, even though the latter group voted by mail in large numbers. Like Georgia, Texas did not require an identification to vote by mail, but has a strict ID requirement for in-person voting. The partisan makeup of the electorate didn’t appear to change, either. The Democratic share of voters appeared to tick up by two-tenths of a percentage point — enough to decide a very close election. But it’s also so small that it could just be statistical noise, with no effect at all. Social science methods just don’t offer the level of precision necessary to nail down whether this, or any, change might move the needle by a tenth of a point. The Georgia law doesn’t come anywhere close to eliminating no-excuse absentee voting, unlike what the political scientists tested in Texas. As a result, one might expect the new law to have an even smaller effect. (You could make a counterintuitive argument that making absentee voting harder is worse for Democrats than eliminating it altogether, and that Democrats might be better off discouraging people from mail voting to avoid unnecessary ballot rejections of people who could have successfully voted in person.) The Georgia runoff elections, while hardly a scientific case study, nonetheless offer another useful example. There were fewer opportunities to vote in advance compared with the general election, because of the shorter election campaign and the holiday season. Based on the drop-off in early voting, many analysts wound up underestimating the final turnout by 20 percent or more. In the end, turnout exceeded expectations. The number of Election Day voters was higher than it was in the general election, as many people who might have voted early if it weren’t for Christmas or New Year’s Day now turned out on Election Day. Maybe runoff turnout would have been higher with the same early voting opportunities as in the general. But maybe not. And none of this had any discernible negative effect on the Democrats, who of course did better than they did in the general. How is it possible that something like eliminating no-excuse absentee mail voting, a method beloved by millions of voters, wouldn’t materially affect turnout or election results? One simple answer is that   as often assumed. Almost everyone who cares enough to vote will brave the inconveniences of in-person voting to do so, whether that’s because the inconveniences aren’t really so great, or because they care enough to suffer them. This supposes a certain reasonable level of convenience, of course: Six-hour lines would change the calculation for many voters. And indeed,   turnout. It also supposes a certain level of interest. Someone might think: There’s no way I’m waiting a half-hour in line to vote for dogcatcher. Similarly, the importance of a convenient voting option probably grows as the significance of a race decreases. The implication, though, is that nearly every person will manage to vote if sufficiently convenient options are available, even if the most preferred option doesn’t exist. That makes the Georgia election law’s effort to curb long lines potentially quite significant. Not only might it mitigate the already limited effect of restricting mail voting, but it might even outweigh it. Another reason is that convenience voting may not be as convenient for lower-turnout voters, who essentially decide overall turnout. Low-turnout voters probably aren’t thinking about how they’ll vote a month ahead of the election, when they’ll need to apply for an absentee ballot. Someone thinking about this is probably a high-turnout voter. Low-turnout voters might not even know until Election Day whom they’ll support. And that makes them less likely to take advantage of advance voting options like no-excuse early voting, which requires them to think about the election early and often: to submit an application, fill out a ballot and return it. As a result, convenience voting methods tend to   favoring high-turnout voters. The methods ensure that every high-interest voter has many opportunities to vote, without doing quite as much to draw less engaged voters to the polls. A final reason is that voting restrictions may backfire by angering and energizing Democratic voters. This law’s restrictions on handing out water in line, for instance, may do more to mobilize Democrats than to stop them from voting. One recent study even theorized that the Supreme Court’s decision to roll back elements of the Voting Rights Act   because subsequent efforts to restrict voting were swiftly countered by efforts to mobilize Black voters. That doesn’t mean the Georgia law or other such laws are without consequence. Many make voting more difficult, enough to intimidate or discourage some voters. Many outright disenfranchise voters, even if only in small numbers. Perhaps the disenfranchisement of even a single voter merits outrage and opposition, especially if the law is passed on dubious or even fabricated grounds, and with Jim Crow mass disenfranchisement as a historical backdrop. But setting aside intent, it does mean that many such voting provisions, like that in Georgia, are unlikely to have a huge effect on turnout or Democratic chances. There are consequences to misunderstanding the stakes of changing voting laws. Minor changes in voting access can overshadow larger issues, including the kinds of potentially significant provisions in the Georgia law that empower the State Legislature. The democracy reform bill H.R. 1, for instance, would do quite a bit to expand voting access but relatively little to protect against partisan interference in election administration. The perception that voting laws have existential stakes for democracy or the political viability of the two parties has made bipartisan compromise extremely difficult. The virtue of bipartisanship is often and understandably dismissed as naïve, but voting laws are a rare case where bipartisanship has value of its own. Democracy, after all, depends on the consent of the loser."
Is Biden Missing His Chance on Guns?,politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/biden-gun-control.html,"After six long years of legislative wrangling, Joe Biden was on the brink of victory. His historic crime bill was finally moving toward passage. Only one issue stood in his way: a controversial, 10-year federal ban on assault weapons. “Six years ago, it was guns. Five years ago, it was guns. Four years ago, it was guns. Last night it was guns. This morning it was guns,” Mr. Biden  , during end-stage negotiations over the legislation. “And right now, it’s guns. It’s guns, guns, guns, guns.” Much of Mr. Biden’s legislative career could be summarized in the same way. For decades, he played a crucial role in major legislative battles over gun control, championing proposals to tighten regulations on guns and their owners. On the campaign trail last year, Mr. Biden proposed the most expansive gun control platform of any presidential candidate in history, promising to reinstate the assault weapons ban, institute a voluntary gun buyback program and send a bill to Congress on his first day in office repealing liability protections for gun manufacturers and closing background-check loopholes. Yet 73 days into his presidency, with   and more than   deaths having already occurred this year, Mr. Biden is approaching the issue with far less urgency. Of the   he has given so far, none have addressed gun control. That bill he promised to send to Congress never arrived. And his use of the bully pulpit to push for new measures has been uneven to nonexistent. Less than 24 hours after a shooting rampage last month in Boulder, Colo.,  , Mr. Biden promised action, saying he didn’t need to “wait another minute, let alone an hour, to take common sense steps” on gun control. When pressed on those measures by reporters two days later, he seemed more comfortable waiting: He quickly dismissed the specifics of his proposals as   before making clear that his focus would be  . “Of any president in my lifetime, he has the most expansive understanding of gun violence,” said Kris Brown, the president of Brady: United Against Gun Violence. “But I’ll be honest, when I first heard that, it did not make me feel good.” Mr. Biden wasn’t always a champion of gun control. During his early years in the Senate, he   for liberal views on gun control, won positive ratings from the National Rifle Association and  . His position shifted during the long legislative battle over the criminal justice bill, which ended up being the biggest gun control victory during his nearly half a century in Washington. For the next three decades, he approached the issue with the zeal of a convert. From his earliest days as vice president, he  . After the massacre of 26 children and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, Mr. Obama tasked Mr. Biden with   — an effort that ended in defeat. Six years later, Mr. Biden went viral comforting the families of the victims of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. As president, he’s taking a much lower profile on the issue, focusing far more intently on efforts to pass his relief bill earlier this year and to champion his infrastructure package. It’s a position that extends throughout the administration: A day after the Boulder shooting, Vice President Kamala Harris pressured the Senate to take action, deflecting more than six minutes of questions about what executive actions the president was prepared to take. “This is going to be about your viewers and all of us pleading to the reason, pleading to the hearts and minds of the people in the U.S. Senate,” she said. “Let’s say, ‘We’re going to hold our elected people accountable if they’re not going to be with us.’” A few days later, when asked about the issue during a visit to a school in Connecticut, she quickly pivoted from guns to promoting the administration’s relief package. Behind the scenes, White House advisers have met with gun control advocates and are working on a series of executive orders restricting firearms. They point to $5 billion for community-based violence prevention programs that was tucked into the infrastructure bill, heralding it as a historic investment. But privately, many worry that the White House may be losing the momentum for political action that comes each time the country is yet again horrified by a mass shooting. They also realize that the period for a new administration to accomplish big legislative goals before the politics of a midterm election take hold is relatively short. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has   to pass the infrastructure bill by July 4. There’s also a second part of the legislation that deals with “human infrastructure” policies, like paid family leave and universal pre-K. Some gun control advocates fear that they are being bumped to the back of the line. “It’s dizzying when you think about where we are and the real time we have. It’s not a lot,” Ms. Brown said. “There is no question the administration is working aggressively on the issue internally, but it needs to be communicated with the same passions externally.” Of course, it appears unlikely that any proposal restricting guns could pass the narrowly divided Senate. Even though   has been creeping higher, and the nation’s most powerful gun lobby, the N.R.A., is weakened and bankrupt, Republicans have shown no indication of supporting any such legislation. “Every time there’s a shooting, we play this ridiculous theater where this committee gets together and proposes a bunch of laws that would do nothing to stop these murders,” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas,   in an opening statement during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun violence last month, a week after the mass shooting in Boulder and an earlier one in the Atlanta area. “What happens in this committee after every mass shooting is Democrats propose taking away guns from law-abiding citizens because that’s their political objective Passage of any kind of gun legislation would most likely  the filibuster, a procedural tactic that would allow the party to pass bills with their tight majority. And even then, some Democrats are skeptical that gun legislation would pass, given the divides within their own caucus. When asked  , Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont responded simply: “I wish I could tell you that was the case.” With his decades of legislative experience, Mr. Biden certainly knows the odds are long. And he also knows the crucial role that presidential leadership plays in rallying the public around any gun control measures. When Mr. Biden stood behind Senator George Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, during that August 1994 news conference, he was quick to attribute their success to the staunch support of someone else: President Bill Clinton. “Were it not for President Clinton, there is no possibility, zero possibility, that this significant piece of legislation would be law,” he said. “No president that I have served within the 22 years I’ve been here was willing to go out on the line, flat out, and say, ‘We’re not going to have a bill unless there is the gun ban in the bill for assault weapons.’” He added: “That was the ultimate leverage that George Mitchell and Joe Biden had.” … That’s   of a coronavirus vaccine.

An Equine Virus Alarms Europe’s Equestrian Community,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/olympics/equestrian-horse-virus-deaths.html,"Shortly after arriving from abroad last month, Dr. Kent Allen’s new patient spiked a low fever. The doctor inserted a sterile swab into his patient’s nostril, a P.C.R. test to determine if this was yet another case of a potentially deadly virus sweeping the globe. Then the patient went back to eating his hay. The gray Irish Sport Horse, named McCoy, tested negative for an illness currently devastating European equestrian sports. An outbreak of a neurological form of the common equine herpes virus has killed nearly 20 horses and sickened over 100 more. It has forced the shutdown of competitions across 10 European countries. With eerie echoes of the human coronavirus and the current pandemic, the virulent equine virus, which can kill a horse in less than 24 hours, has raced through the sport horse industry at a time when experts say it can least afford it: The shutdowns to stop the spread of the virus, known as E.H.V., come after nearly a year of shutdowns in the face of Covid-19. The coronavirus closed barns and canceled international championships, including last year’s World Cup Finals for dressage and show jumping, an important Olympic proving ground. The event was to take place this week in Gothenburg, Sweden. Instead, on March 12, it was canceled again. “On the back of Covid, which is of course still having a devastating impact worldwide, this E.H.V.-1 outbreak has been particularly tough,” Dr. Goran Akerstrom, the veterinary director of the Fédération Equestre Internationale, or F.E.I., the international governing body of equestrian sports, said in an email. “Particularly for those that have lost horses.” He added, “To lose the F.E.I. World Cup Finals two years in a row — and to two different viruses — has been incredibly hard.” The outbreak began at an international competition in Valencia, Spain, in late February, killing several top German show horses on the grounds. Organizers locked down some of the 752 animals in attendance, but some riders had left with their animals for their home countries — unwittingly taking the virus with them. The virus has since been identified in 10 nations — Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Slovakia and Qatar — possibly linked to the Valencia event. The United States has been spared, so far. “I still can’t believe that we had no opportunity to help you,” Tim-Uwe Hoffmann, a German rider, wrote on Instagram in tribute to his mare, Casta Lee FRH, who died after testing positive at the Valencia show. The F.E.I. has ordered international competitions on mainland Europe shut until at least mid-April. Nearly 4,000 horses who were in contact with potentially contagious animals after the show in Valencia have been ordered isolated for 21 days by the federation, which is conducting a sweeping test-and-trace initiative across European farms. After the isolation ends, they must return a negative P.C.R. test to return to competition. “It was basically a textbook superspreader event,” Dr. Allen, McCoy’s owner, said of the Valencia competition. Dr. Allen is a veterinarian based in Middleburg, Va., who also serves as the F.E.I.’s head veterinarian for the United States. The equine herpes virus is not a new enemy; it is endemic in the horse population and typically manifests as a runny nose and fever. But the version that has raced through barns after the Spain outbreak is far more deadly. It invades the central nervous system and causes myeloencephalopathy, or inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. The death itself, veterinarians say, is swift but brutal. Biosecurity can be difficult: Shed virus can be spread by touch, on clothing and down a barn aisle by a snorting horse. While horses are routinely vaccinated for herpes, which affords some protection, the vaccine does not necessarily stop them from shedding virus. The virus can incubate in an animal for nearly a month, causing no signs of distress. Sick horses can test negative; asymptomatic horses can spread the disease. For years, competition organizers and riders have largely paid lip service to biosecurity measures like sanitizing shared areas and keeping foreign animals apart, according to veterinarians and show staff. Pathogens are spread readily in a sporting environment where horses routinely swap stalls when stabled at competitions, nibble the same grass and touch noses beside the arena. “You’d talk biosecurity measures, and their eyes would glaze over,” Dr. Allen said. “It’s: ‘You send us that protocol, and we’ll shove it in the deepest depths of our filing cabinet.’” But the trauma that humans have experienced for the past year may be their horses’ best defense: After over a year of social distancing, vigorous hand washing and masking, industry leaders say, the equine world is stepping up to stem the spread in a way that it did not in past outbreaks, such as one in Ogden, Utah, in 2011, which reached at least a half-dozen states before it was quelled “In today’s climate with the Covid-19 pandemic, people are very aware of the need to practice biosecurity measures for themselves and were primed to take additional steps to keep their horses safe when protocols were recommended,” Dr. Stephen Schumacher, the chief administrator of U.S. Equestrian’s equine drugs and medications program, said in an emailed statement. Those steps stateside have so far appeared to ward off an American outbreak. But the specter of the disease, which gets little reaction most years when it crops up, has set the American industry on edge. In early March, at a competition at the World Equestrian Center in Ocala, Fla., news of a virus case in a horse that had competed at the facility sent frissons of anxiety through competitors, hundreds of whom had flocked to the show grounds, which opened this season for the first time. Though there was no outbreak on the grounds, entries plummeted to 500, from over 2,000, shortly after the show alerted competitors about the ill animal, as riders packed up their horses and left, according to Dr. Larry Wexler, the competition’s official veterinarian. The entries have since rebounded. Through a publicist, an owner of the center, Roby Roberts, declined to comment. This month, a quarter horse, a warmblood and an Arabian from separate stables in California tested positive for the neurological form of the virus, according to the Equine Disease Communication Center, exposing dozens of their stablemates. Cases have cropped up in places like Kentucky and New York, according to the center, as well as in Canada, where a larger outbreak forced several barns to quarantine in February. It is unclear if the smattering of American cases is linked to the European illness, or merely incidences of the virus that routinely occur. In Europe, F.E.I. officials are optimistic that the worst has passed, but emphasize that there are still reasons for caution. So far, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has not suspended the importation of horses from affected countries. Smaller nations like Jamaica, where an outbreak might overwhelm the limited horse population, banned imports in an attempt to keep the virus from its shores, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries’ veterinary services division. So when McCoy, the gray Irish sport horse gelding, which Dr. Allen imported for his wife, Dr. Rae Stone, spiked a fever shortly after arriving on American soil last month, Dr. Allen whipped out a nasal swab. “It was no big deal,” Dr. Allen said after the P.C.R. test came back negative for the herpes virus. Still, he said, he had to wonder: “When that is going on the European continent, and you’re importing horses over here, are you importing problems?”"
"With New Wrinkle, N.H.L. Division Races Heat Up",sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/hockey/nhl-division-races-trade-deadline.html,"There’s a lot that is different about the N.H.L. schedule this season. Start with the compressed timeline, requiring 868 regular-season games to be played in 119 days. Then there are the numerous Covid-19 protocols and restrictions, with more added since the season started. And due to the postponements and shutdowns, schedules have been in near-constant flux, wreaking havoc on practices and planning. Yet there’s widespread agreement that this season’s scheduling format, which mostly features two-game series in the same city with a day off in between, and the geography-driven divisional alignment, has enlivened what typically is a grueling slog to the Stanley Cup playoffs. “If you could put fans in the building,” Winnipeg Coach Paul Maurice said, “I would love for it to be like this forever.” As teams approach the final 20 games of the regular season, and races to gain playoff position by finishing in the top four of each division intensify, this year’s schedule provides another bonus. The exclusively intradivisional play makes each contest a four-point game and provides the potential for quick climbs or slides in the standings. In its 10 games starting March 11, Nashville went 7-3, including a five-game winning streak, to move from sixth place in the Central Division into a tie for fourth. After beating the Rangers on March 4, Philadelphia was tied for second place in the East Division with 27 points. Going into its game Wednesday, the Flyers had fallen to fifth, three points out of a playoff spot. “You can’t afford to lose two or three in a row, and everyone knows that,” Winnipeg forward Pierre-Luc DuBois said. DuBois added: “It’s just part of the fun challenge this year.” With such volatility in the standings, the challenge for general managers, especially as the April 12 trade deadline approaches, is determining which clubs are buyers and which are sellers. “I think teams are a little more reluctant to shake the tree, as it were, than they normally are,” Minnesota General Manager Bill Guerin said in a video news conference Wednesday. “Speaking for us, we’re keeping team chemistry in mind because we have good team chemistry and the guys are playing well together. So do you upset that? It’s still pretty quiet out there.” The games themselves have more energy and intensity, Maurice said, partly because of the reduced travel. Last season, Boston was in a division with Florida and Tampa Bay. This year, the Bruins’ most distant opponents are Pittsburgh and Buffalo, and travel between the others — Washington, Philadelphia, the Devils, the Rangers and the Islanders, has been done by train or bus. This season, Vancouver has to make three trips instead of one, to play games in Montreal, Toronto, and Ottawa. But in all three cases it is scheduled to play two multi-game series and return home, rather than remain on the road as part of a longer trip, dramatically lessening travel demands. “There’s times in the normal schedule where a team’s coming in, they’ve played the night before, and they get in at four in the morning, so that’s a big advantage to us,” Detroit Coach Jeff Blashill said. “Now, for the most part, we’re all in the same boat, so travel becomes less of a factor.” Players also like the ability to focus on an opponent for more than one night. Teams have had to make more adjustments, Flyers forward Travis Konecny said. “It’s about adapting and surprising the other team with different stuff every night, and they’re doing the same thing to us, so it’s fun,” he said. Geography has created new rivalries and intensified others. The teams in the United States now play each other eight times, while the seven Canadian teams play four teams nine times and two teams 10 times. Carolina, which was in the Metropolitan Division last season, is in the same division as Florida and Tampa Bay this year, and all three teams are bunched at the top of the Central. “There are some guys you’re not going to like more than others on back-to-back nights,” Carolina forward Brett Pesce said. Before this season, the last time N.H.L. teams played each other three straight times was in 2012-13. Already there have been a few four-game series — a league first. And from Feb. 2 to 15, the Coyotes and Blues played seven straight times because of Covid-related postponements that required schedule shuffling. The teams split the first six games, and Arizona’s Clayton Keller scored the only goal in the seventh. “It was a fun series,” Keller said. “Almost every game was tight, and it had a playofflike atmosphere.” Carolina played four straight games against Tampa Bay in February and finished a four-game set with Columbus on March 25, losing the first two games at home and winning the last two on the road. For Hurricanes forward Jordan Martinook, no series against a single opponent is too long. “Looking back to October and November, when we were thinking we might not even be playing a season, I don’t care if we play one team 56 times,” he said. “As long as you’re playing N.H.L. games, you can’t take it for granted. I’m just happy we’re playing.” During a news conference on March 11, N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman said the league would return to its former divisional alignment next season. He did, however, leave open the option to tweak the schedule to allow for more intradivisional play as well as back-to-back games, which would please Blashill. “I think it’s very, very difficult to beat the same team twice in a row,” said Blashill, a former college and American Hockey League coach. “I saw that going back to my college hockey background, and we had that in the A.H.L. as well. It makes for very competitive games night in and night out.”"
Georgia’s Voting Law Puts Sports and Sponsors on the Spot,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/georgia-voting-law-sports-criticism.html,"Major League Baseball said it was reviewing its decision to hold this summer’s All-Star Game in Atlanta amid an outcry over a restrictive voting law, and President Biden said this week that he would support such a move. But the sport’s commissioner said he would go no further than that for now. As outrage over the new law built this week, not everyone was as willing to go on the record with their next move. The N.C.A.A., which has intervened in state political battles in the past, did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did the Southeastern Conference, which hosts its annual football championship game in Atlanta. Representatives for the Masters golf tournament across the state in Augusta did not return phone calls or email messages. Corporate sponsors like Mastercard and Budweiser declined to comment. Baseball partners like Bank of America, Chevrolet, DraftKings, Gatorade, Geico, Google, MGM Resorts and Taco Bell did not respond to requests for interviews. Around the country, corporations and major sports entities have paused to reconsider where Georgia and other states fit into the national events ecosystem after Georgia’s passage of a sweeping law that restricts voting access. That Atlanta is considered a   and was the baseball home to  , who endured racism with grace and dignity en route to breaking Babe Ruth’s home run record, has complicated the calculus.  comes amid a national movement among Republican-controlled state legislatures   to mount the  . In Georgia, the law introduced stricter identification requirements for absentee balloting, limited the use of drop boxes and  And already, pressure is building on leagues, teams, sponsors and even individual athletes to choose a side in those fights, or at least in the Georgia one for now. The National Black Justice Coalition called for the PGA Tour and the Masters Tournament to pull next week’s major championship from Augusta National Golf Course. (The Masters is run not by the PGA Tour, but by the Augusta National Golf Club.) The civil rights organization is also asking PGA Tour players not to compete in Georgia until the voting law is repealed. The Women’s P.G.A. Championship will be held in the Atlanta area in June. “The PGA Tour and Masters Tournament have both made commitments to help diversify golf and address racial inequities in this country — and we expect them to not only speak out against Georgia’s new racist voter suppression law, but to also take action,” said David J. Johns, executive director of the organization, in a statement. Major League Baseball is gathering feedback from teams and executives before coming to a decision on relocating the game, Commissioner Rob Manfred said this week in a wide-ranging interview with  . Tony Clark, the executive director of the M.L.B. Players Association, has said the union was willing to discuss pulling the game, scheduled for July 13. “I am talking to various constituencies within the game and I’m just not going beyond that in terms of what I would consider or not consider,” he said. President Biden called the   and others proposed across the country “Jim Crow on steroids,” and  . He has noted the success that N.B.A. and W.N.B.A. players had in bringing attention to social justice issues after the police killing of George Floyd in May 2020. Sports leagues have taken on state legislatures before: The N.B.A. moved the 2017 All-Star Game out of Charlotte, N.C., after a law was passed barring transgender people from using bathrooms in public buildings that do not correspond with the gender on their birth certificate. The law was later repealed and Charlotte hosted the All-Star Game in 2019. In 1991, after Arizona refused to make Martin Luther King Jr. Day a paid holiday, N.F.L. owners voted to remove the 1993 Super Bowl from the state and instead held it at the Rose Bowl in California, costing the Phoenix area an   at the time. This time, many sports entities have stayed quiet, with most statements coming after the law was signed and only after  . Only a few have put their opposition on the record. “Any legislation that makes it harder for people to vote strikes at the very foundation of our democracy,” said Mark Tatum, the N.B.A. deputy commissioner. “The N.B.A. will continue to work alongside our partners and nonpartisan voting organizations to help ensure that voting is more accessible for every American regardless of party affiliation.” Arthur Blank, who owns the N.F.L.’s Atlanta Falcons, Major League Soccer’s Atlanta United, said “the right to vote is simply sacred.” He added in a statement: “We should be working to make voting easier, not harder for every eligible citizen.” Christina Kim, an American golfer, said the Georgia law, and others like it, was certain to spark dialogue. “There is such an importance in taking a moment, truly having conversations, not caring if it’s a red or blue state, representative, governor, mayor, person and just think about what the correct thing to do is,” Kim said. Eric Reveno, an assistant men’s basketball coach at Georgia Tech who last year was the force behind the N.C.A.A. making Election Day a mandatory day off from athletic activities, was skeptical that moving events like basketball tournament games or football playoff games out of Georgia would have the desired effect. “I worry it’s not a simple thing that a PR push can fix,” Reveno said. “I know there’s a lot of corporate pressure and the N.C.A.A. can do that. But that may be asking the N.C.A.A. to fix something that they can’t fix.” Reveno said a grass-roots focus was more appropriate. “If voting absentee is harder, voting by drop boxes is harder and there are less early voting dates, how can we help people vote?” he said. “Politicly and legally, what’s the best way to make voter participation and opportunity broader and more egalitarian?” Corporate sponsors will most likely play an important role in determining whether baseball’s All-Star Game, or any other major sporting events, in Georgia or in other states, will be moved or canceled in protest of laws limiting access to voting. But so far, M.L.B. sponsors have been mostly silent. A spokeswoman for one partner, T-Mobile, said in a statement that “we believe that every American should have the ability to freely exercise their right to vote.” Still, after seeing how a   influenced corporations to speak out publicly against the law — among them Coca-Cola, which is headquartered in Georgia — voting rights activists have set their sights on the sporting world. Cliff Albright, co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, said activists “were a little too quiet early” and should have been more vocal before the law was passed. Albright said he has reached out to  , the voting rights advocacy group led by a collective of athletes including LeBron James, for help fighting upcoming bills in states like Texas. “At the bare minimum is what we want them to continue to use their platform to make statements and support,” he said.

One Republican’s Lonely Fight Against a Flood of Disinformation,politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/denver-riggleman-republican-disinformation.html,"AFTON, Va. — Denver Riggleman stood virtually alone. It was Oct. 2, on the floor of the House of Representatives, and he rose as one of only two Republicans in the chamber to speak in favor of   denouncing QAnon. Mr. Riggleman, a freshman congressman from Virginia, had his own personal experiences with fringe ideas, both as a target of them and as a curious observer of the power they hold over true believers. He saw a dangerous movement becoming more intertwined with his party, and worried that it was only growing thanks to words of encouragement from President Donald J. Trump. “Will we stand up and condemn a dangerous, dehumanizing and convoluted conspiracy theory that the F.B.I. has assessed with high confidence is very likely to motivate some domestic extremists?” asked Mr. Riggleman, a former Air Force intelligence officer. “We should not be playing with fire.” Six months later, conspiracy theories like QAnon remain a threat that most Republicans would rather ignore than confront, and Mr. Riggleman is out of office. But he is ever more determined to try to expose disinformation from the far right that is swaying legions in the Republican base to believe in a false reality. Mr. Riggleman is a living example of the political price of falling out of lock step with the hard right. He   after he officiated at   of a gay couple. And once he started calling out QAnon, whose followers believe that a satanic network of child molesters runs the Democratic Party, he received death threats and was attacked as a traitor, including by members of his own family. The undoing of Mr. Riggleman — and now his unlikely crusade — is revealing about a dimension of conservative politics today. The fight against radicalism within the G.O.P. is a deeply lonely one, waged mostly by Republicans like him who are no longer in office, and by the small handful of elected officials who have decided that they are willing to speak up even if it means that they, too, could be headed for an early retirement. “I’ve been telling people: ‘You don’t understand. This is getting worse, not better,’” Mr. Riggleman said, sitting on a stool at his family bar one recent afternoon. “People are angry. And they’re angry at the truth tellers.” Mr. Riggleman, 51, is now back home in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, where he and his wife run the bar and a distillery. And for his next move in a career that has included jobs at the National Security Agency and founding a military contracting business, he is working with a group of other experts to shine a light on what he calls the “social disease” of disinformation. His experience with the issues and emotions at work is both professional and personal. He was so intrigued by false belief systems that he self-published a book about the myth of Bigfoot and the people who are unshakably devoted to it. Mr. Riggleman, who first ran and won in 2018 after the Republican incumbent in his district retired, joined the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus and was endorsed by Mr. Trump.  Now he says it “gives me shivers” to be called a Republican. He hopes to show that there is still a way to beat back the lies and false beliefs that have spread from the fringe to the mainstream. It is a heavy lift, and one that depends on overcoming two strong impulses: politicians’ fear of losing elections and people’s reluctance to accept that they were taken in by a lie. Mr. Riggleman summarized his conversations with the 70 percent of House Republicans he said were privately appalled at the former president’s conduct but wouldn’t dare speak out. “‘We couldn’t do that in our district. We would lose,’” he said. “That’s it. It’s that simple.” Stocky, fast-talking and inexhaustibly curious, the former congressman is now working for a group of prominent experts and academics at the Network Contagion Research Institute, which studies the spread of disinformation in American politics and how to thwart it. The group has undertaken several extensive   into how extremists have used propaganda and faked information to sow division over some of the most contentious issues of the day, like the coronavirus pandemic and police violence. Their reports have also given lawmakers a better understanding of   and other radical ideologies that helped fuel the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Mr. Riggleman said he had written one report about the involvement of far-right militants and white supremacist groups in the attack specifically at the request of a Republican member who needed help convincing colleagues that far-left groups were not the culprits. Getting lawmakers to see radical movements like QAnon as a threat has been difficult. Joel Finkelstein, the director of the Network Contagion Research Institute, said that in June, when the group tried to sound the alarm on QAnon to members of Congress, Mr. Riggleman was the only one who responded with a sense of urgency and agreed to help. “We were screaming it from the rooftops,” Mr. Finkelstein said. “We said: ‘This is going to be a problem. They’re growing increasingly militant in their conspiracies.’” When the institute’s members spoke to Mr. Riggleman, he said, “We showed him our data and he said, ‘Holy moly.’” Far from a theoretical or overblown concern, disinformation and its role in perpetuating false beliefs about Mr. Trump’s election loss and its aftermath are problems that some Republicans believe could cripple their party if left ignored. In a sign of how widespread these conspiracy theories are, a recent poll from Suffolk University and USA Today found that   of Trump voters wrongly believed the storming of the Capitol was mostly inspired by far-left radicals associated with antifa and involved only a few Trump supporters. “There was a troika of us who said, ‘This is going to a bad place,’” said Paul Mitchell, who represented Michigan in the House for two terms before retiring early this year in frustration. He said he had watched as members dismissed Mr. Riggleman, despite his experience in intelligence. “There weren’t many people who gave a damn what your expertise was,” Mr. Mitchell said. “It was inconsequential compared to the talking points.” Mr. Riggleman’s loss last summer in a closely held party convention allowed him to be more outspoken. The winner, Representative Bob Good, is a former associate athletic director at Liberty University who took issue with Mr. Riggleman’s officiation at the gay wedding and called him “out of step” with the party’s base. And as Mr. Riggleman kept it up and spoke out more aggressively against Mr. Trump after the election, his fight got lonelier. “I had a colleague of mine pat me on the shoulder and say: ‘Denver, you’re just too paranoid. You’re killing yourself for the rest of your life politically by going after the big man like this,’” Mr. Riggleman recalled. When he returned to Virginia for good in January, he said he sometimes felt just as isolated. Family members, former constituents and patrons at the distillery insisted that the election had been stolen from Mr. Trump. And they couldn’t be talked out of it, no matter how hard he tried. He recalled a recent conversation with one couple he is friends with that he said was especially exasperating. “I go over stats,” he said. “I go over figures. I go over the 50 states, how that actually works. How machines that aren’t connected are very hard to hack. How you’d have to pay off hundreds of thousands of people to do this.” “Did not convince them,” he added. Other friends of his, some of whom are also members of the growing group of former Republican lawmakers now publicly criticizing Mr. Trump, said that many conservative politicians saw no incentive in trying to dispel disinformation even when they know it’s false. “What some of these guys have told me privately is it’s still kind of self-preservation,” said Joe Walsh, a former congressman from Illinois who ran   against Mr. Trump last year. “‘I want to hang onto the gig. And this is a fever, it will break.’” That is mistaken, Mr. Walsh said, because he sees no breaking the spell Mr. Trump has over Republican voters anytime soon. “It’s done, and it was done a few years ago,” he said. Mr. Riggleman, who is contemplating a run for governor in Virginia and is writing a book about his experience with the dark side of Republican politics, sees a way forward in his experience with Bigfoot. The sasquatch was how many people first learned about him as a politician, after an opponent accused him of harboring a fascination with “Bigfoot erotica,” in 2018. “I do not dabble in monster porn,” he retorts in his book, “Bigfoot … It’s Complicated,” which he based in part on a trip he took in 2004 on a Bigfoot expedition. The book is full of passages that, if pulled out and scrubbed of references to the mythical creature, could be describing politics in 2021. Mr. Riggleman quotes one true believer explaining why he is absolutely convinced Bigfoot is real, even though he has never seen it. In an answer that could have come straight from the lips of someone defending the myth that Mr. Trump actually won the 2020 election, the man says matter-of-factly: “Evidence is overwhelming. Check out the internet. All kinds of sightings and facts.” At another point, Mr. Riggleman describes a conversation he had with someone who asked if he really thought that all the people claiming to have seen Bigfoot over the years were liars. “I don’t think that,” Mr. Riggleman responds. “I do believe that people see what they want to see.” He did find one way to crack the Bigfoot false belief system: telling true believers that they were being ripped off to the tune of hundreds or thousands of dollars to go on expeditions where they would never actually see the creature. “They got very angry,” he said. But eventually, some started to come around."
"Capitol Suspect Struggled Before Attack, but Motive Remains Unclear",politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/capitol-suspect-noah-green.html,"On the football field at Christopher Newport University in Virginia, Noah R. Green was No. 21, a dependable and good-natured, if soft-spoken, presence in the defensive backfield. Off the field, he was laser-focused on Black economic empowerment, counseling teammates on financial management and plotting a career helping close the racial wealth gap. But by late March, after a bruising pandemic year that friends and family said left him isolated and mentally unmoored, Mr. Green’s life appeared increasingly to revolve around the Nation of Islam and its leader  , who has repeatedly  . “Follower of Farrakhan,” Mr. Green labeled himself on Facebook, where he described leaving his job and grappling with “some of the biggest, unimaginable tests in my life.” None of it appeared to hint at what he would do next. On Friday afternoon, law enforcement officials said, Mr. Green, 25, drove a dark blue Nissan sedan from nearby Virginia to the United States Capitol and   He then got out of the car brandishing a knife and lunged at officers. Police shot and mortally wounded him. The attack, which pierced through the calm of a spring afternoon on Capitol Hill, halted the return to normalcy that had slowly begun to take hold there following the deadly Jan. 6 riot. It sent the police force that protects the Capitol into a fresh round of mourning and further complicated a raging debate over how to secure the seat of Congress at a time of increasing threat. And it raised questions about how a dedicated athlete and aspiring businessman with no known history of violence came to turn his car into a lethal weapon. Without a clear motive, investigators were frantically combing through a trove of social media posts and a trail of woes described by people close to Mr. Green to understand what happened. Police have not categorized the incident as an act of domestic terrorism. A senior law enforcement official, who spoke anonymously to describe the active inquiry, said that, based on early evidence, investigators believed that Mr. Green was influenced by a combination of underlying mental health issues and a connection to an ideological cause that provided justification to commit violence. Brendan Green   on Friday that his brother had been teetering on the edge for months, plagued by mental health problems and possibly drugs. Noah Green had briefly moved to Botswana this year, he said, and tried to jump in front of a car, before returning and asking to move in with his brother in suburban Virginia, not far from Washington. Brendan Green said his brother had become violently ill on Thursday night and left the apartment, declaring that he was ready to become homeless. Attempts to reach Brendan Green and other members of the Green family were unsuccessful, including at his Virginia apartment. The family   expressing condolences for the family of Officer William F. Evans, who died in the attack, and speculating that Mr. Green’s struggles may have been related to head injuries sustained playing football. One of 10 siblings, Mr. Green grew up in Covington, Va., a largely white Shenandoah Valley town of less than 6,000 dominated by a WestRock paper mill. On Facebook, he described it as not “the best of circumstances,” but at Alleghany High School, he was voted the most valuable player of the football team and won honors on the track team. After a stint at Glenville State College in West Virginia, he transferred to Christopher Newport University, a small public school in Newport News, Va., where he studied business and joined the football team.  , he spoke of dreaming of vacationing in Jamaica, admiring his grandmother and wanting to meet Malcolm X. Former teammates described Mr. Green as a hard worker and said he was close to his family, whose members would make the lengthy drive across the state to watch him play. But on and off the field, they said, he kept mostly to himself. “He would be there, but he like wasn’t really there,” said Chet Wilborne, a fellow defensive back. “I feel like he always felt like an outsider.” The distance only grew, Mr. Wilborne recalled, after Mr. Green accused someone of drugging him with Xanax, a powerful anti-anxiety drug, without his knowledge. Mr. Wilborne remembered Mr. Green saying that the incident “altered my mind-set about how I think about people.” “Everybody at school was talking about it,” Mr. Wilborne said. Another teammate, who asked to remain anonymous given the sensitivity of the ongoing investigation, recalled that Mr. Green would often talk to fellow players about strategies to save and invest, emphasizing the need to close the wealth gap between white and Black America. Mr. Green volunteered one summer for a college program focused on preventing violence in the nearby Hampton Roads. And after college, the teammate said, Mr. Green began working as a financial adviser, with aspirations to start a finance company to help the Black community and eradicate poverty. Mr. Green made little secret of his more recent struggles and his apparently intensifying interest in the Nation of Islam. He posted speeches and articles by Mr. Farrakhan and  , who led the Nation of Islam from 1934 to 1975, discussing the decline of America. A string of posts in the early hours on March 17 charted his course as he saw it. “I was able to graduate with distinction, earn a well-paying job straight out of college, and pursue my graduate degree, despite not growing up in the best of circumstances,” he wrote on Facebook. “My ultimate goal was to learn business, after hearing the words of the Minister years ago, and to use that to improve the lives of communities most in need. Particularly, the communities of black and brown here in the United States.” But, Mr. Green wrote, Allah evidently had different plans. He said he was newly unemployed, having left his job “partly due to afflictions” left unnamed. He pointed without detail to struggling with “side effects of drugs I was intaking unknowingly.” His ambitions to build a career in business had been “thwarted.” “I haven’t had much to lean on the past few months, I’ve been faced with fear, hunger, loss of wealth, and diminution of fruit,” he wrote. “My faith is one of the only things that has been able to carry me through these times.” Mr. Green also posted a photo of a $1,085 donation he made as “Noah X” to the Nation of Islam’s Norfolk chapter for Saviours’ Day, the holiday honoring the birthday of its founder. A group of members standing outside the Norfolk chapter on Saturday declined to comment on Mr. Green when approached by a reporter. A Black nationalist movement that has pushed for African-American self-sufficiency, the Nation of Islam has been condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center for “the deeply racist, anti-Semitic and anti-gay rhetoric of its leaders,” including Mr. Farrakhan. Mr. Green’s adherence is likely to increase scrutiny on the group, as investigators try to determine whether his beliefs played a role on Friday’s attack. The relationship between violence and the Nation of Islam has been debated since it started about 90 years ago, especially as outsiders and insiders have disagreed over its teachings. “From the earliest times in Nation history, people have been taking these texts and saying, this is about killing white people,” said Michael Muhammad Knight, an assistant professor of religion and cultural studies at the University of Central Florida, who specializes in American Islam. “The Nation has a very strong anti-violence discourse that goes all the way back to the beginning,” he said. “Consistently, if you look at the Nation, you don’t see the body count that white supremacist organizations have.” In his Facebook posts, Mr. Green sometimes used apocalyptic language, suggesting he believed in an imminent end-of-world conflict. He referenced the “mother wheel,” which in Nation teachings is a spaceship that will descend on America in an apocalyptic battle, Mr. Knight explained. In his final Facebook post on March 21, Mr. Green wrote about a “divine warning,” that these were the “last days of our world as we know it.” Court records in Indiana, where he briefly lived, show Mr. Green had applied in December to legally change his name to Noah Zaeem Muhammad. But when he didn’t show up for a hearing in the final days of March, the proceeding was dismissed. By then, he was back in Virginia, living with his brother. Just days later, he would drive to the Capitol. Elizabeth Dias ,  Ben Decker  and Robyn Sidersky contributed reporting.  Jack Begg  contributed research."
,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/business/bill-hwang-archegos.html,"Until recently, Bill Hwang sat atop one of the biggest — and perhaps least known — fortunes on Wall Street. Then his luck ran out. Mr. Hwang, a 57-year-old veteran investor, managed $10 billion through his private investment firm, Archegos Capital Management. He borrowed billions of dollars from Wall Street banks to build enormous positions in a few American and Chinese stocks. By mid-March, Mr. Hwang was the financial force behind $20 billion in shares of ViacomCBS, effectively making him the media company’s single largest institutional shareholder. But few knew about his total exposure, since the shares were mostly held through complex financial instruments, called derivatives, created by the banks. That changed in late March, after shares of ViacomCBS fell precipitously and the lenders demanded their money. When Archegos couldn’t pay, they seized its assets and sold them off, leading to one of the biggest implosions of an investment firm since the 2008 financial crisis. Almost overnight, Mr. Hwang’s personal wealth shriveled. It’s a tale as old as Wall Street itself, where the right combination of ambition, savvy and timing can generate fantastic profits — only to crumble in an instant when conditions change. “That whole affair is indicative of the loose regulatory environment over the last several years,” said Charles Geisst, a historian of Wall Street. “Archegos was able to hide its identity from regulators by leveraging through banks in what has to be the best example of shadow trading.” The meltdown of Mr. Hwang’s firm had ripple effects. Two of his bank lenders have revealed billions of dollars in losses. ViacomCBS saw its share price halved in a week. The Securities and Exchange Commission opened a preliminary inquiry into Archegos, two people familiar with the matter said, and market watchers are calling for tougher oversight of family offices like Mr. Hwang’s — private investment vehicles of the wealthy that are estimated to control several trillion dollars in assets. Others are calling for more transparency in the market for the kind of derivatives sold to Archegos. Mr. Hwang declined to comment for this article. His is a proverbial American rags-to-riches story. Born in South Korea, Mr. Hwang moved to Las Vegas in 1982 as a high school student. He spoke little English, and his first job was as a cook at a McDonald’s on the Strip. Within a year, his father, a pastor, had died. He and his mother moved to Los Angeles, where he studied economics at the University of California, Los Angeles, but found himself distracted by the excitement of nearby Santa Monica, Hollywood and Beverly Hills. “I always blame people who set up U.C.L.A. in such a nice neighborhood,” he told congregants at Promise International Fellowship, a church in Flushing, Queens,  . “I couldn’t go to school that much, to be honest.” He graduated — barely, he said — and pursued a master of business administration at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He then worked for about six years at a South Korean financial-services firm in New York, eventually landing a plum job as an investment adviser for Julian Robertson, the respected stock investor whose Tiger Management, founded in 1980, was considered a hedge fund pioneer. After Mr. Robertson closed the New York fund to outside investors in 2000, he helped seed Mr. Hwang’s own hedge fund, Tiger Asia, which focused on Asian stocks and quickly grew, at one point managing $3 billion for outside investors. Mr. Hwang was known for swinging big. He made large, concentrated bets on shares in South Korea, Japan, China and elsewhere, using ample amounts of borrowed money — or leverage — that could both supercharge his returns or, in turn, wipe out his positions. He was more modest in his personal life. The house that he and his wife, Becky, bought in Tenafly N.J., an upscale suburb, is valued at about $3 million — humble by Wall Street standards. A religious man, Mr. Hwang established the  , a New York-based nonprofit that sponsors Bible readings and religious book clubs, growing it to $500 million in assets from $70 million in under a decade. The foundation has donated tens of millions of dollars to Christian organizations. “He’s giving ridiculous amounts,” said John Bai, a co-founder and managing partner of the equity research firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, who has known Mr. Hwang for roughly three decades. “But he’s doing it in a very unassuming, humble, non-boastful way.” But in his investing approach, he embraced risk and his firm ran afoul of regulators. In 2008, Tiger Asia lost money when the investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy at the peak of the financial crisis. The next year, Hong Kong regulators accused the fund of   it had received to trade some Chinese stocks. In 2012, Mr. Hwang reached a civil settlement with U.S. securities regulators in a separate insider trading investigation and was fined  . That same year, Tiger Asia pleaded guilty to federal insider-trading charges in the same investigation and returned money to its investors. Mr. Hwang was barred from managing public money for at least five years. Regulators formally  Shortly after shuttering Tiger Asia, Mr. Hwang opened Archegos, named after the Greek word for leader or prince. The new firm, which also invested in both U.S. and Asian stocks, was similar to a hedge fund, but its assets were made up entirely of Mr. Hwang’s personal wealth and that of certain family members. The arrangement shielded Archegos from regulatory scrutiny because of its lack of public investors. Goldman Sachs, which had lent to him at Tiger Asia, initially refused to deal with Archegos. JPMorgan Chase, another “prime broker,” or large lender to trading firms, also stayed away. But as the firm grew, eventually reaching more than $10 billion in assets, according to someone familiar with the size of its holdings, its lure became irresistible. Archegos was trading stocks on two continents, and banks could charge sizable fees on the trades they helped arrange. Goldman later changed course, and in 2020 became a prime broker to the firm alongside Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley. Nomura also worked with him. JPMorgan refused. By the beginning of this year, Mr. Hwang had grown fond of a handful of stocks: ViacomCBS, which had pinned high hopes on its nascent streaming service; Discovery, another media company; and Chinese stocks including the e-cigarette company RLX Technologies and the education company GSX Techedu. Trading at roughly $12 a little over a year ago, ViacomCBS’s stock rose to about $50 by January. Mr. Hwang kept amassing his stake, people familiar with his trading said, through complex positions he arranged with banks called “swaps,” which gave him the economic exposure and returns — but not the actual ownership — of the stock. By mid-March, as the stock moved toward $100, Mr. Hwang had become the single largest institutional investor in ViacomCBS, according to those people and a New York Times analysis of public filings. The people valued the position at $20 billion. But because Archegos’s stake was bolstered by borrowed money, if ViacomCBS shares unexpectedly reversed he would have to pay the banks to cover the losses or be quickly wiped out. On Monday, March 22,   plans to sell new shares to the public, a deal it hoped would generate $3 billion in new cash to fund its strategic plans. Morgan Stanley was running the deal. As bankers canvassed the investor community, they were counting on Mr. Hwang to be the anchor investor who would buy at least $300 million of the shares, four people involved with the offering said. But sometime between the deal’s announcement and its completion that Wednesday morning, Mr. Hwang changed plans. The reasons aren’t entirely clear, but RLX, the Chinese e-cigarette company, and GSX, the education company, had both spiraled in Asian markets around the same time. His decision caused the ViacomCBS fund-raising effort to end with $2.65 billion in new capital, significantly short of the original target. ViacomCBS executives hadn’t known of Mr. Hwang’s enormous influence on the company’s share price, nor that he had canceled plans to invest in the share offering, until after it was completed, two people close to ViacomCBS said. They were frustrated to hear of it, the people said. At the same time, investors who had received larger-than-expected stakes in the new share offering and had seen it fall short, were selling the stock, driving its price down even further. (Morgan Stanley declined to comment.) By Thursday, March 25, Archegos was in critical condition. ViacomCBS’s plummeting stock price was setting off “margin calls,” or demands for additional cash or assets, from its prime brokers that the firm couldn’t fully meet. Hoping to buy time, Archegos called a meeting with its lenders, asking for patience as it unloaded assets quietly, a person close to the firm said. Those hopes were dashed. Sensing imminent failure, Goldman began selling Archegos’s assets the next morning, followed by Morgan Stanley, to recoup their money. Other banks soon followed. As ViacomCBS shares flooded onto the market that Friday because of the banks’ enormous sales, Mr. Hwang’s wealth plummeted. Credit Suisse, which had acted too slowly to stanch the damage, announced the possibility of significant losses; Nomura announced as much as $2 billion in losses. Goldman finished unwinding its position but did not record a loss, a person familiar with the matter said. ViacomCBS shares are down more than 50 percent since hitting their peak on March 22. Mr. Hwang has laid low, issuing only a short statement calling this a “challenging time” for Archegos.  Kitty Bennett  contributed research."
FIFA Has a Plan for Africa. But Whom Does It Serve?,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/soccer/fifa-gianni-infantino-africa.html," Something strange has happened, Tariq. A few weeks ago, someone drew my attention to a   from Barbara Gonzalez, the chief executive at Simba, one of the biggest clubs in Tanzania, that seemed to reveal a plan that would change the face of African soccer: a pan-continental super league. But that’s not the strange part. The strange part is that it turns out it’s the brainchild of Gianni Infantino, the FIFA president. As a general rule, making sure you’re on the opposite side of any argument from Infantino is a solid strategy. But in this case my instinct is to say that, at least as an idea, this kind of makes sense. Please explain to me why I am wrong, so that the world can be restored to its axis.  As with everything when it comes to FIFA — and typically FIFA under Gianni Infantino — the devil is in the detail. Or, in this case, the lack of detail. Infantino first announced his big idea for Africa  , but it had been dormant until this random tweet (more on that in a minute). But when Infantino first went public, people inside FIFA say there was no business plan: just Gianni firing from the hip, claiming it could generate $200 million in revenue. That’s a big number as far as African club football is concerned, but there is no evidence of where it came from. It reminds me of the time Gianni walked into a FIFA Council meeting and told the board to sign a document that would allow him to sell the Club World Cup to private investors (who turned out to be SoftBank). The members, led by European officials, wanted details. An internal audit found the event was worth considerably less than Gianni had suggested. Now, back to the tweet: It turns out FIFA officials were surprised, too. Barbara González walked up to Gianni at the Confederation of African Football Congress and asked to have her photo taken with him. Five minutes later, she sent out the tweet. Now I’m not saying a league in Africa is a bad idea, but surely there must be a robust plan before such a major project is undertaken?  If nothing else, you have to admire the chutzpah of that, not least because Infantino strikes me as  the sort of person who would fall for the old “as you were saying” ruse. There does, as you say, have to be a robust plan: economically, of course, but in a sporting sense, too. The basic idea strikes me as sound. Certainly south of the Sahara, African club soccer struggles horribly for investment. That means that the vast majority of nations that produce a constant stream of players for European clubs rarely see any of that talent on show in domestic leagues. That, in turn, hardly entices fans to go and watch games live. And that completes a neat but vicious circle, because it means that, yes, clubs struggle horribly for investment. A Super League would address some of those issues. A better television deal, if nothing else, would enable clubs to invest in infrastructure. That might help nurture young talent and keep it for a little longer. It doesn’t seem impossible to me that a Pan-African league might be able to rival one of the talent-generating leagues in Europe — the Netherlands or Portugal, say — for quality in a relatively short space of time. Of course, there is one thorny issue that I haven’t yet had the nerve to bring up. I reckon I could come up with a fairly cogent list of 20 or so African teams that would have a good case for inclusion, thanks to history or support or location. But I am guessing that Infantino and CAF, which is now run by a staunch ally of his, might have a different system in mind?  The little we know so far is that there is an expectation that participating teams would have to invest at least $20 million per season, for five seasons. For clubs in Africa, that is a significant outlay, and it suggests it would not be the most popular teams, so much as the ones that have the backing of wealthy benefactors. But again: Beyond the odd tweet and Gianni’s off-the-cuff remarks, we have nothing concrete. There are other ways of trying to come up with likely participants. You could use the CAF club coefficient, which is essentially a points system for clubs in the region based on their historic success. But that would mean a league dominated by clubs from wealthier North African countries, with only a dozen or so of the continent’s 54 countries likely to be represented.  That lack of representation would, I think, ultimately be unavoidable. For a tournament like this to be valid, there are certain clubs that would have to be included. Al Ahly and Zamalek from Cairo, would be names one and two. Both Raja and Wydad from Casablanca, and Esperance and Étoile du Sahel, the twin totems of Tunisian soccer. You would certainly need South Africa’s Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs. And you could throw Mamelodi Sundowns in there, too: It is owned by Patrice Motsepe, Infantino’s ally and the new CAF president. Simba, of Tanzania, clearly expect to be involved. TP Mazembe, from the Democratic Republic of Congo, would have to be. Beyond that, the continent’s powerhouse nations — Cameroon, Senegal, Algeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and, particularly, Nigeria — would command at least one place each. Suddenly, the whole thing looks pretty full, even before thinking about Angola, Sudan and Ethiopia.  If there was a method to wrap this league into the existing pyramid, there would probably be far more buy-in. The idea that teams from across the region would have — at least in theory — a shot at one day making it into the competition would make the proposition far more palatable to those, even among the larger clubs, who are not enthused about it. Even then, there are the logistics of it: not only to create a level playing field, but a sensible calendar and schedule, given the enormous differences in weather and transport infrastructure across the region. Given the uncertainty and sense of unease among the African football community, there needs to be an urgent and transparent discussion about what this is, and what this is not. A series of clandestine meetings followed by a high-profile announcement that does not stand up to scrutiny is not enough.  There is, definitely, a back-of-a-cigarette-packet air to the idea. And worse still, it has the feel of something that is being imposed on Africa, rather than generated from within it. The problem of representation bears that out: this sort of thing is much easier to conceive if, deep down, you regard Africa as a single, homogeneous entity, grateful for your interest. And that — given Infantino’s apparent passion for the idea — makes you wonder what the purpose of it all is. Has it been suggested in an attempt to make African domestic soccer stronger, a challenging but essentially admirable aim? Or is there something else at play here?  There’s a suspicion that Gianni’s motivations may be less to do with securing the future of African soccer and more his hopes of creating a club competition that can rival and, eventually, overtake the Champions League. For that to happen, the expanded Club World Cup needs teams from all over the world who can compete with the powerhouses of Europe. In that light, Africa might just be the start, the canary in the coal mine. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but those involved should be clear about their intentions. And a defining project for the future of African soccer should be guided by those with skin in the game, no question, rather than a Swiss bureaucrat intent on a legacy project.  Ah, that’s a relief. I feel as though I am on much more solid ground now: the idea might have some merit, but the rationale behind it may not. That may not be good news for African soccer, which finds itself being used as a pawn in a broader power game, but it’s good news for my personal moral compass, because it means I don’t have to worry about being on the same side of an argument as Gianni Infantino. There was, just as there was always going to be, one last hurdle to clear. Most European soccer executives were expecting a blueprint for a new vision of the Champions League to be approved — both by UEFA, the competition’s organizer, and the European Clubs Association, Andrea Agnelli’s bad-idea factory — and announced this week. That had to be pushed back, though, when several of the continent’s major teams blew up the deal at the 11th hour: It turns out that actually they want to have final say on the competition’s commercial rights, too. Suddenly, it seems as if the new-look Champions League may end up being the lesser of two evils. Quite how that revamped competition will work is laid out clearly and concisely — and, crucially, in the form of a graphic —  . So clearly and concisely, in fact, that for the first time it is possible to say without fear of having missed something that this iteration of the Champions League will make the tournament immeasurably worse. Not, though, for the reasons so often given. Yes, there will be more meetings between the game’s superpowers, and for lower stakes. Yes, the whole thing is bloated. Yes, it will starve domestic competitions of oxygen. And yes, it still might serve to entrench the financial inequality that is the real enemy of the game’s ongoing health. But the main problem is much simpler: The redesign reduces the Champions League’s competitive integrity. It is, essentially, invalid to draw up a league table in which all of the teams play different opponents. It renders it meaningless. And it is quite likely that fans, who are not as stupid as they are taken to be, will notice. A few days ago, as England threatened to run up the score in a World Cup qualifier against San Marino, the poacher-turned-pundit Gary Lineker suggested it was time to admit that these mismatches — which characterize a substantial amount of international soccer — were of benefit and interest to precisely nobody. Instead, he said, perhaps it would be in everyone’s interests for some of Europe’s smaller nations to engage in a prequalifying tournament, playing one another for the right to face the continent’s elite, and England. The reaction — Do I really need to say this? You know what the reaction is, because it’s always the same reaction — was furious. To Lineker’s critics, those who accused him of trying to ghettoize soccer’s underdogs, what followed was karmic retribution.  . Spain needed a late goal  . Latvia  . And, best of all,  , the country’s first loss in a World Cup qualifier for 20 years. It goes without saying that all of these results were welcome, impressive, and hilarious. But it does not mean that the idea Lineker espoused — one that has been around for years — should be dismissed. First of all: That is how qualifying works in Africa, Asia and North and Central America. It helps to thin the calendar a little, something that matters at a time when players are being run into the ground by all of the teams they represent. Second: The success of the Nations League has shown that games between smaller nations are more competitive, and therefore both more entertaining and more educational, than watching the same teams be steamrollered by the giants. And third: At the same time as all those shocks were rumbling through Europe, England was scoring five against San Marino, the Czechs ran in six in Estonia, and both Belgium and Denmark scored eight, against Belarus and Moldova. Worse still, a team managed by Frank de Boer  . Some of soccer’s lesser lights are competitive. Some are not. If only there was a way of selecting which teams fell into which categories. We have been here before. On Thursday, it emerged that Mino Raiola and Alfie Haaland — respectively the agent and the father of Erling Haaland, the goal cyborg — were in Catalonia for a meeting with Joan Laporta,  . The race for the hottest property in European soccer is, it seems, on. It is a move straight from the playbook that eventually led the younger Haaland to Borussia Dortmund, his current home, about 15 months ago. Expect Raiola and Haaland’s father to turn up in relatively short order in Madrid, too. They will almost certainly stop off in London after that: Chelsea harbors hopes of signing the 20-year-old Haaland. They may need two days in Manchester; they would not want to rush United or City. The fact that they are doing their due diligence on their client/son’s next home is, then, no surprise. More eye-catching is the fact that they feel Barcelona’s hopes of signing Haaland are valid, given that Dortmund has made it plain that it will not sell him for less than $150 million, and because Barcelona is, well, currently  . Laporta, clearly, feels he can make a deal work. Perhaps he can. Perhaps there is some way of shifting the money around enough for Barcelona to remain a viable candidate. The appeal is obvious: Signing Haaland would, almost at a stroke, turn Barcelona into major players again. But then so, too, is the problem: After all the club has been through, would it really be a good idea? Aside from the virgin hope of opening day — and possibly the breathless frenzy of Christmas — this is the best part of the soccer season. The end of the March international break heralds not only the arrival of spring, but the start of European club soccer’s race to the summit. Over the next two months, closure will arrive. Better yet, this time around, we hit the ground running. The top two in both France and Germany will meet on Saturday: first, Lille visits Paris St.-Germain, the two of them level on points, and only a nose ahead of Lyon and Monaco. (I’ll have a story on Lille posting in a few hours.) No sooner has that finished, though, than RB Leipzig hosts a Bayern Munich deprived of Robert Lewandowski, and knowing that a win would close the gap at the top of the Bundesliga to a single point. In England, meanwhile, the ultimate prize is off the table: It is a matter of when, not if, Manchester City claims a third title in four years. But the battle to finish second, third and fourth — and therefore obtain a place in next season’s not-yet-ruined Champions League —  . My money would be on Manchester United, Chelsea and Leicester, in that order, but it’s so close that it wouldn’t be much of my money. Only space for one, this week, from  . “I’m trying to figure out how much disappointment is warranted right now as a supporter of the United States,” he wrote. “How do you rate the U.S.A. men’s team’s failed attempts to qualify for Tokyo? There’s a lot of talk about the Olympics as a training ground for the next generation, but when I look at the U.S. squad, the next generation is playing senior friendlies in Europe.” This is only a personal perspective, Charles, and it is a distinctly European one: My view would, I think, be different if I was South American or African. But in the narrow context of soccer, I’m not convinced the Olympics matter particularly. It is special for the players to win a gold medal, of course, particularly when it at least rivals the high-point of that country’s soccer achievements thus far (Nigeria in 1996, Cameroon in 2000, Mexico in 2012) or when it is Argentina (2004 and 2008), and the World Cup brings nothing but misery. But in terms of being used a signpost for greater things to come? In men’s soccer, no, not really. Put it this way: I had to check who won the gold at Rio in 2016. Turns out it was Brazil! They must have enjoyed that. It probably didn’t make up for what happened in a different tournament on home soil  . Women’s soccer, of course, has historically placed much more importance on it — the cover of Abby Wambach’s autobiography describes her as a gold medalist, rather than a World Cup winner — but I wonder if that, too, will change with the increased focus on the Women’s World Cup."
"A Team in Anguish, a Vote and a Season Relinquished",sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/sports/ncaa-womens-team-out.html,"Word had trickled down in late December to J.D. Gustin, the women’s basketball coach at Dixie State University, a southern Utah college making the leap to N.C.A.A. Division I athletics, that some of his players had misgivings about continuing to play during the pandemic. At that point, most of the players and coaches had previously contracted the coronavirus, and the team had canceled three of its first six scheduled games because of infections. But their Western Athletic Conference season was about to begin, and the coach needed to know where his team stood. So Gustin handed his players a brief letter he had typed himself. It reassured them that their scholarships were secure but also asked a yes-or-no question they could answer anonymously: Did they want to opt out of the season? He asked everyone to think about it overnight and then fold the papers in half and return them. The verdict arrived the next day: Eight wanted to play; six wanted to opt out. “It shocked me,” Gustin said of the divide. “I was reeling.” Immediately, he began meeting with players individually. One was struggling with online classes. Two had parents who had lost jobs. Some players had injuries that might have been connected to getting sick. Others had lost family members to the virus. Still, Gustin thought there were enough who wanted to play, and he felt obligated to honor their wishes, too. For some of them, basketball could soothe feelings of isolation. So on Jan. 3, he sent a letter to the team on university letterhead, breaking down how the team had voted and laying out why he thought the season could go forward. He asked the players to let him know by noon the next day if they were in or out. He closed the three-page letter by writing, “Love you all no matter what.” The next day after practice, one of the players who had written that she wanted to play asked to speak with him. She said that she actually feared continuing to play, Gustin said, but was uncomfortable expressing that because her parents wanted her to keep going and because her roommate, also a member of the team, favored playing. That night, Gustin went to athletic department administrators. “I said, ‘We can’t do this,’” he said. A news release was crafted, and the announcement came the next day, Jan. 5: The Dixie State Trailblazers were canceling their season. As the women’s national tournament headed toward its championship game on Sunday in San Antonio, and the men progressed toward their final in Indianapolis on Monday night, teams have been lauded for their perseverance in playing during the pandemic. Hundreds of games were postponed or canceled during the regular season; some teams paused their seasons for weeks; and those who advanced to the N.C.A.A. tournaments have been isolated in hotels to avoid contracting the virus. But not everyone made it to the finish line. Or even the starting blocks. The eight Ivy League colleges were among those that never started, their presidents deeming sports too great a health risk. Others reached the same decision after the season had begun. Including the Ivies, 27 Division I women’s teams and 13 on the men’s side canceled their seasons early because of concerns about the virus, according to the N.C.A.A. Among the women’s teams were prominent names — Duke, Virginia and Vanderbilt. Varied circumstances contributed to the decisions to cancel: Southern Methodist’s players had previously accused their coach, whose contract was not renewed last month, of abusive behavior; a Vanderbilt player developed a heart condition linked to the virus; Cal State Northridge did not have enough players.  There appeared to be a common factor: The decision was not simple. “For myself, it’s been an internal battle,” Vermont Coach Alisa Kresge said in an interview after her team had ended its season in late January. Two of her grandparents died in nursing homes from the virus, both of them saying their last goodbyes on a video call. And her players went into quarantine three times, having food delivered and texting roommates with advance notice about trips to the bathroom. But for many of Kresge’s players, who had won three consecutive games when their season ended, basketball was an emotional and mental outlet. “I sit on the fence every day,” she said. “Are we doing the right thing? Should we be making decisions for others? There are so many layers to this.” Those conflicts were not exclusive to the teams that gave up their seasons. Mike Krzyzewski, Geno Auriemma, Rick Pitino and Tara VanDerveer, all Hall of Fame coaches, expressed misgivings during the regular season about playing amid the pandemic. And an N.C.A.A. poll released in February, which surveyed more than 25,000 athletes, found that mental health concerns last fall were one and a half to two times more prevalent than in prepandemic surveys. At Dixie State, worries had percolated for months. Gustin, in his fifth year as coach, understood from experience that the strands that bind a team are manufactured only partly at practice and in games. In a normal summer, his players would work as counselors at a Dixie State youth camp during the day and play pickup games at night. There would be a team barbecue in August, a retreat to cabins in the hills, tailgating at football games and group outings to student events. Later, there would be Halloween and Christmas parties. All of that was wiped out in the past year. When players returned to the campus in St. George for the fall semester, some barriers between teammates, which might already have been knocked down in a typical year, remained standing. Emily Isaacson was recovering from surgery to repair torn knee ligaments that cut short her freshman season. Isaacson, eager to please and a sharp student from speck-on-the-map Perry, Utah, had poured herself into rehab over the summer. Even if she wasn’t ready to play 40 minutes a game, she was ready to start the season opener. “I was so grateful to be playing,” she said. MaKayla Johnson, a senior from Fort Worth with a worldly view and a big personality, arrived in far from game shape. Players intuitively know who is laser focused at practice, staying after to take extra shots or getting to the weight room early, but few at Dixie State knew what the pandemic had been like for Johnson. Her church superintendent and a relative died from the virus in the early stages of the pandemic. Johnson, who has asthma, contracted the virus in June. Her father, who has had two strokes, developed Covid-19 in August, prompting Johnson to return home from campus briefly. Her mother contracted the virus, too. Johnson said she had lost someone almost monthly in the past year. She has experienced loss before: An older sister died of lupus when Johnson was in the fourth grade. But this was different. “It’s been kind of tough for me, but basketball has always been a grieving tool,” said Johnson, one of two Dixie State players who had deaths in their extended families. “I’d use it as an escape. Whenever I was dealing with something, it wasn’t hard for me to separate things from inside the lines.” Johnson said that she had voted to continue the season but that she fully accepted her teammates’ decision to end it. The ability to compartmentalize — to shut out crowd noise, the pressure of a big moment or off-the-court drama — is often viewed as a valuable tool for an athlete. Few of the Dixie State players do this more adeptly than Isaacson. She had to spend her birthday under quarantine, and then she contracted the virus, with mild symptoms, shortly after Thanksgiving. But she had basketball. “I wanted to play so badly,” Isaacson said. “Because of my last year, you don’t know what it’s like until you don’t have it. I love basketball. It’s a part of me.” When Duke canceled its season in December, she thought, “Oh, there’s no way that would ever happen to my team.” And then it did. Isaacson, who cried when Gustin told the team its season was over, was angry and frustrated to have lost another season. She was also sad that she didn’t know the depths of the hurt some of her teammates were experiencing. “That broke my heart,” she said. “I didn’t know teammates had family who were sick and they kept it to themselves. I didn’t want anyone carrying that, thinking, ‘Can I just get through this practice?’ It opened my eyes. I have to realize it’s bigger than basketball.” Three months have passed since the decision to stop playing. Everyone in the program has had time to think — particularly Gustin. His teams had improved each season, from five wins to 12 to 15 and then to 18 in 2019-20, the team’s last season in Division II. He went to the W.A.C. tournament in Las Vegas to watch games and meet conference officials. He has spent more time watching film than he can ever remember. He also spent time reflecting on the decision to stop. Another coach at the college told Gustin that he would have found kids off the street to keep playing. Though senior administrators were ultimately supportive, there was some initial conflict among them. All of this was taking place in a community where the pandemic was seen, in some quarters, as overblown. “New York City is different from St. George,” Gustin said. “It’s a very conservative, white community.” There has also been another consideration: his job security. As a result, he decided to overhaul his roster. The N.C.A.A. has allowed every athlete in a fall or winter sport to take an extra year of eligibility because of the uncertainties of a pandemic season, but only eight Dixie State players are returning. Some are not having their scholarships renewed for tactical reasons — Gustin wants to play a more up-tempo style. Others were denied because he felt that the players had used the pandemic as an excuse not to work on their skills or physical condition. (He said that only three players, one of whom was Isaacson, had done voluntary individual workouts with coaches in January and February.) Others chose to move on; one player wants to become a firefighter. The conversations, he said, were often tearful. “It’s like you’re piling on, but it’s your choice to pile on if you’re me,” Gustin said. “I’m not trying to be a bad guy, but this is D-I basketball. I understand this is debatable, but we needed a fresh start. The past is the past. I respect Covid, but Covid days are over.” Johnson is among those not returning, a decision she said was hers. She is on track to graduate with a degree in recreation and sports management — she is finishing up an internship at a gym near campus — and wants to transfer to a college near her home in Texas for her final season.  “I’m embarking on a new journey,” she said. When next season’s Dixie State team held its first practice on March 15, that, too, felt like a new beginning. The Trailblazers will go to Costa Rica in August to play three exhibition games and spend a few days at the beach. It is partially a reward, Gustin told the players, for sticking through the last 12 months. It is also insurance. The players will get to know one another, and the coaches will get to know them, too. The college’s sports psychologist met several months ago with the team, without the coaches present, and he reported back to Gustin: There was no trust in this room. “That’s something,” Gustin said, “that a coach doesn’t want to hear.”"
,style,https://www.nytimes.com/es/2021/04/02/espanol/amigos-covid.html,"No es como si 2020 haya sido un año sin amigos. Brindamos en fiestas de cumpleaños por Zoom, organizamos noches de concursos en   y pasamos más tiempo que nunca  , sin duda un gran lugar para hacer  . Yo incluso hice un nuevo amigo. Su nombre es Josh y es un escritor que vive en mi vecindario. Durante años, Josh permaneció en la categoría de “tipo genial que sin duda debería conocer mejor”. La vida se interpone en el camino. Pero la vida cambió en marzo del año pasado. Cuando nuestras familias se unieron en una misma burbuja, Josh se convirtió en una especie de salvavidas para mi cordura mientras otros amigos desaparecían. Asamos hamburguesas en un clima de 1 grado Celsius y nos estresamos sobre política mientras nuestros hijos jugaban al escondite. La crisis creó una cercanía. Sin embargo, pasar todo ese tiempo con Josh también me hizo darme cuenta de cuánto se había reducido el resto de mi vida social. Muchos amigos desaparecieron dentro de sus propias burbujas. Nuestro amigo en común, Jay, quien me presentó a Josh, estuvo en su casa de Connecticut durante toda la pandemia. Todavía tengo la botella de whisky envuelta en papel de regalo que le compré para su cumpleaños 40, en febrero de 2020. ¿Mis amigos en Los Ángeles? Pues, se quedaron en Los Ángeles. ¿Mis amigos de la universidad? Nuestra última reunión fue el 11 de marzo de 2020: cenamos en TriBeCa. Nos enteramos de que la NBA había suspendido la temporada mientras disfrutábamos nuestras ostras. Atrás quedaron las noches de martes de póquer que estábamos intentando convertir en costumbre (alguien todavía me debe 14 dólares). Atrás quedaron las cenas con las parejas que veíamos cada tres meses. Y aparentemente, atrás quedó la mitad de los amigos que son padres de los compañeros de escuela de nuestros hijos. ¿No tenemos todos historias parecidas? Para muchos de nosotros la pandemia fue un gran cernedor social, una reducción de nuestros círculos de amigos más amplios a un grupo mínimo esencial: aquellos que estaban próximos y disponibles en nuestro círculo de confianza. ¿Todos los demás? Bueno, quedaron “en espera” hasta que “todo esto termine”, por citar una frase trillada. Pero dado que los estadounidenses están recibiendo más de   al día, ese día podría estar cerca. La suposición común es que todos estamos contando los minutos para volver a salir, y lanzarnos de cabeza entre multitudes alegres como asistentes a un carnaval. Las fiestas en casa con la música a todo volumen. Las pistas de baile sudorosas. Darnos codazos para pedir un trago en un bar a reventar. En resumen: ¡gente! Y para muchos, eso sin duda es cierto. Quizás no para todos. Un año es mucho tiempo. La gente envejeció, se mudó. Algunas personas se casaron, otras se divorciaron. La gente cambió.  . En el proceso, las redes sociales que nos conectaban llegaron al límite de su capacidad. “Todos han cambiado su manera de interactuar”, afirmó Rebecca G. Adams, profesora de sociología y gerontología en la Universidad de Carolina del Norte en Greensboro, que estudia las redes de compañeros. Durante el año pasado, dijo, dejamos de explorar y a menudo limitamos nuestros raros encuentros a pequeños grupos de personas de confianza. No obtuvimos nuevas amistades. “Si no puedes salir a lugares públicos”, dijo Adams, “no haces nuevos amigos casuales, y los amigos casuales que ya tienes simplemente desaparecerán de tu radar. No sabemos cuál será el efecto duradero de estas alteraciones sociales”. Estamos a punto de averiguarlo. Es más que razonable preguntarse si seremos capaces de revivir todas esas amistades que pasaron un año “en espera”, e incluso si acaso queremos hacerlo. Recuerda el fantástico festival de música electrónica Neverland de 2019. Recuerda las fiestas a las que fuiste, los pícnics, las noches en las discotecas. ¿Dónde están todas esas personas ahora? ¿Cuánto las extrañas? Depende de los amigos, obviamente. Los amigos por lo general caen en categorías, como esos viejos afiches de pirámides alimentarias en el comedor de la escuela, excepto que, en este caso, el pequeño triángulo en la cima es donde están los mejores amigos que más te nutren. La amplia base de la pirámide representa a los conocidos, los casi amigos, los amigos de los amigos y a las personas amigables que, al igual que los panqués de matcha y las salchichas envueltas, son geniales para picar como bocadillos en una fiesta, pero no llegan a ser una comida completa. Este tipo de conocidos casuales pueden ser categorizados como relaciones de “ ”, para invocar un término acuñado por el sociólogo de la Universidad Stanford Mark Granovetter en la década de 1970, y   en enero. Fueron los primeros en desaparecer durante la pandemia, cuando las tiendas, los restaurantes y las oficinas cerraron. Mull les brindó un panegírico a estos casi amigos que repentinamente desaparecieron de su vida: “El chico que siempre está en el gimnasio al mismo tiempo que tú, la barista que comienza a hacer tu pedido habitual mientras todavía estás al final de la fila”. Si bien es posible que no tengas el número de estas personas en tu celular, son importantes en su conjunto, dijo Adams, quien lo siente en su propia vida. Como una fanática de la música, Adams extraña a las multitudes que bailaban y llenaban los clubes de Greensboro. Ya se aventurará a regresar a esos lugares en algún momento. La escena será diferente. “Sé por estar en Facebook que mucha gente se ha mudado o ha muerto, así que cuando baje a la esquina a escuchar música, un montón de gente que conozco no va a estar allí”, dijo. “En algunos casos ni siquiera sé sus apellidos. Pero disfrutamos de estar juntos escuchando la música”. No todo el mundo quiere que vuelva toda esa gente de más.  , de 35 años, productora en una emisora de radio de Seattle, ha estado bien sin la “gentuza”, los extraños medio amigos. “Suena duro cuando se habla de amistades”, dijo Stevens, “pero realmente no hay lugar para la gentuza en ninguna parte de la vida, porque emocionalmente, todos estamos a tope. Por ejemplo, yo ya no llevo tacones: gentuza. Ya no participo en el programa del sistema de amigos en el trabajo: gentuza. Y ya no hay amigos gentuza, para bien o para mal”. Lo más probable es que otra persona ocupe el lugar de esa barista amigable que desapareció. Pero, ¿qué sucede con los amigos de segundo y tercer nivel, esas personas con las que todavía eres lo suficientemente formal como para intercambiar correos electrónicos, pero no mensajes de texto? La compañera del trabajo demasiado sincera con la que solías chismear mientras bebían unos tragos antes de que la despidieran durante la pandemia; los padres de familia con los que te quedabas a conversar un rato a la hora de la salida de la escuela; la hilarante víctima de la moda que se unía a tus salidas a los clubes antes de esfumarse a Miami. “Las amistades casuales se basan principalmente en la proximidad y la conveniencia, más que en una conexión verdadera”, dijo  , exprofesora de psiquiatría en la Escuela de Medicina de la Universidad de Nueva York, quien escribe sobre la amistad. “Están vinculadas a una situación”. El solo concepto de proximidad suena risible. Según una firma de investigación, Unacast, que analizó datos del GPS de millones de celulares, los estadounidenses se   un 80 por ciento menos que antes de la pandemia. Las burbujas pandémicas que muchos de nosotros creamos tal vez fueron un factor. Por definición, unirse a una burbuja significa ver a pocas personas fuera de ella. Y una vez dentro, esa burbuja puede volverse ligeramente parecida a un culto, con matices de “nosotros contra el mundo”. Desarrollas chistes internos y un lenguaje compartido. Todos los demás están fuera del círculo de confianza. ¿Cuán cuidadosos son? ¿Será seguro pasar el rato con ellos? Shana Beal, directora de comunicaciones de una organización sin fines de lucro que vive en Greenbrae, California, vio cómo su círculo social se redujo a unas pocas personas cuando estuvo de vacaciones con su familia y otras dos amigas en una casa aislada por la nieve en el lago Tahoe al comienzo de la pandemia. Al regresar a casa, el “equipo coronavirus”, como se autodenominaron las mujeres, pasó los siguientes meses enviándose mensajes de texto varias veces al día: “¿Debemos limpiar lo que compramos en el supermercado?”, “Mi esposo y yo estamos peleando otra vez, quiero gritar”. “Estaba en picada, presa del pánico, leyendo noticias sombrías, trabajando, criando niños, explotando por dentro”, dijo Beal, de 40 años. “Pero saber que tenía a estas dos mujeres disponibles cuando las necesitara me ayudaba a soportarlo”. Pero también eran lo único que tenía. Incluso hoy, no hay citas para que los hijos jueguen con otros niños, “horas felices” de bares ni cenas con otros amigos. “Es solo este grupo y nuestra familia”, dijo Beal. “Ellos me entienden. Han visto lo malo y lo feo”. Los celulares y las computadoras portátiles omnipresentes que mantienen unidos a los amigos lejanos quizá también, paradójicamente, ayudaron a distanciarlos. Parte de esto se debió a una mera cuestión de números. ¿Cuántas personas puedes incluir en un chat grupal antes de que se convierta en un caos? ¿Cinco, siete? No todo el mundo será seleccionado. FaceTiming, como descubrimos rápidamente, también es un pésimo sustituto de las reuniones en vivo. La   es real. Los chats de video, que se congelan, se desenfocan y cuyo audio se desincroniza, pueden  , como señalaba un artículo de The New York Times en abril del año pasado, fomentar el narcisismo al centrarse la gente en su propia cara, e inhibir la confianza al haber menos contacto visual. La tecnología también resultó ser una forma complicada de convertir una amistad incipiente en algo más. El pasado mes de marzo,  , un artista visual de Los Ángeles, entabló una relación, tanto amistosa como romántica, con un chico que se había pasado por su estudio cerca de MacArthur Park. Salir en persona fue algo suelto y fácil. Pero cuando la amistad se trasladó al teléfono durante el encierro, eso “puso un poco de tensión sobre lo que podría venir después”, dijo. A diferencia de la fiesta posterior a la inauguración de una galería, por ejemplo, no había distracciones que suavizaran las asperezas: no había música que sonara por encima de la cabeza, no había personas que se entrometieran, ni excusas para correr al bar. “Te hace avanzar”, dice Markell, de 29 años. “Las cosas se vuelven muy intencionadas, y no hay una salida casual”. Los dos acabaron acordando dejar las cosas en suspenso. ¿Y qué sucede con nuestros amigos más cercanos? La gente de Wall Street a menudo habla de una “huida hacia la calidad”, la tendencia de los inversores a abandonar las acciones más riesgosas y menos establecidas y preferir acciones de rentabilidad segura durante una crisis. Lo mismo podría decirse de las amistades durante la pandemia: hemos reducido nuestra cartera de amigos a cantidades conocidas. Las tragedias personales, en un año que ha estado lleno de ellas, a veces tuvieron el mismo efecto. “Yo siempre mantenía mi red más amplia de conocidos cerca de mí, por seguridad”, dijo Amy Lin, de 31 años, maestra de escuela en Calgary, Canadá. En agosto perdió a su esposo de manera repentina por una enfermedad no relacionada con la COVID-19. “Todo lo que tenías establecido con tanto cuidado desaparece”, afirmó, “y ese dolor no para de gritarte: ‘¡Estás sola!’”. Lin comentó que, al mes siguiente de su pérdida “tuve que tomar decisiones muy específicas sobre con quién pasaba el tiempo, y las personas con las que pasé tiempo han tenido que cargar con un peso muy grande en cuanto a mi duelo”. Eso incluyó a una de sus mejores amigas, quien condujo tres horas para recogerla en el hospital donde falleció su esposo. Y a los amigos que caminaron con ella bajo temperaturas heladas cuando necesitaba hablar. Lin se dio cuenta de que no necesitaba esa enorme red de seguridad de conocidos. “No sé si habría encontrado este tipo de amistad radical sin estas circunstancias horrendas”, confesó. “Mis mejores amigos, sin ninguna duda, estuvieron allí para mí”. Por eso fue tan duro que la pandemia fuera una época de éxodo. Los habitantes de la ciudad con medios   o a  ; los mileniales se  ; los trabajadores despedidos se trasladaron para   o una vida más barata. Así que incluso las amistades más íntimas se dividieron. “De nuestro grupo de amigos, diez o más familias se mudaron desde que comenzó la pandemia”, dijo Sage Ramadge, de 43 años, un consultor de impacto social que vive en Harlem con su esposa, Naomi Sage (sus amigos los llaman “Los Sage”) y sus tres hijos. “Algunos dijeron: ‘Oye, esta es nuestra oportunidad de probar algo diferente’. Otros consiguieron Airbnbs en la zona rural de Pensilvania o Florida para salir de la ciudad durante unos meses y nunca volvieron”. Ramadge se deprimió durante el verano pensando en ello. Es difícil hacer esos  . “Mi grupo principal de los 20 años ya no existe”, dijo. “¿Cómo encuentras esas conexiones?”. Ahora estamos en primavera. El clima mejora, los restaurantes, bares y estadios vuelven a llenarse, y las tasas de COVID-19 se han  . Es hora de reunir a la vieja pandilla, ¿cierto? Para muchas personas, seguro que sí. Pero no siempre es tan sencillo. “Nos acercamos a un final, y cuando las personas se acercan a los finales, tienden a saborear en vez de explorar”, dijo  , profesora de psicología en la Universidad Stanford, que fundó un centro sobre la longevidad. Ante el cierre de un capítulo, tendemos a “centrarnos en personas y posibilidades conocidas, no en lo expansivo, lo nuevo. No pensamos: ‘Vamos a probar cosas nuevas’”. Los estudiantes universitarios y los jóvenes adultos solteros, explicó Carstensen, tienen más probabilidades de regresar al estilo de vida prepandémico, al coleccionar amigos en masa para maximizar sus oportunidades de encontrar parejas, construir carreras y hallar su lugar en el mundo. A juzgar por las   este mes, sin mencionar a los grupos de veinteañeros que atestan las   sin cubrebocas, muchos parecen estar más que listos. Para otros, hay buenas razones para revivir viejas amistades y alimentar otras nuevas. Al fin y al cabo, los humanos son animales de manada. En este sentido, es fácil preguntarse si la dislocación masiva de nuestras vidas sociales fue simplemente una  , como dijo HuffPost el pasado octubre, o una “ ” de amistad, como señaló un artículo de The New York Times el pasado septiembre. Volveremos a nuestra naturaleza. De forma perversa, los círculos sociales más estrechos que habitamos podrían ser más instintivamente humanos que nuestras promiscuas redes de “amigos” alimentadas por las redes sociales. “Cuando evolucionábamos en la sabana africana, vivíamos toda nuestra vida con grupos relativamente pequeños de 20 o 25 personas”, dijo Carstensen. “Si avanzamos hasta hace cien años, vivíamos en pequeñas granjas familiares. De vez en cuando alguien se acercaba a cinco o seis kilómetros de otra granja”. Otros también aprendieron a apreciar la simple calma de todo esto. “Finalmente, la cultura en general dio permiso para que una no tuviera que asistir a todo”, dijo Lisa Cochran, de 39 años, madre y ama de casa que trabaja medio tiempo en la empresa de plomería de su esposo en Fairfax, Virginia. “Hay algo de libertad en eso”. Incluso los extrovertidos aprendieron lecciones al replegarse. , de 31 años, estilista y bloguera de Brooklyn, solía organizar fiestas enormes. Eran días de ruido, decenas de personas gritando para ser escuchadas por encima de otras. De la energía compartida de cuerpos, conocidos o no, amontonados y ceñidos. Sin embargo, Yvette ha llegado a disfrutar las amistades íntimas que florecieron el año pasado, como la de un vecino que empezó a cantar con ella en su pórtico todas las noches a las siete durante los días más oscuros de la primavera pasada. “Estoy muy agradecida de tener más espacio emocional”, afirmó Yvette. “No me veo cambiando eso. No quiero que eso necesariamente cambie”."

Make Like Matisse and Find the Flowers in Your Newspaper,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/at-home/newspaper-flower-activity.html,"“There are always flowers for those who want to see them,” Henri Matisse said. Even in this newspaper — just glue a skewer between two pieces of colored or painted newspaper and snip it into simple flower shapes. Group the flowers together for an everlasting and inexpensive centerpiece for your spring table, or place one at each place setting. Mini versions can be used as place cards; they’d make even a tiny gathering feel special. If you leave the bottom of the skewers undecorated, you can poke the flowers into a cake or cupcakes for an instant decoration. Or cheer up someone’s work-from-home situation with a potted paper bouquet; they’ll thank you a bunch. 1. If you’d like to, paint a few sheets of newspaper. 2. Cut two pieces of paper to the height and width of your planned flower, leaf and stem or just the flower head. 3. Brush or squeeze a thin strip of glue down the center of the paper, place your dowel on top and apply some more glue over it. Apply a think layer of glue over the rest of the newspaper and place the other piece on top. Gently press it down. (If you want to use as cake toppers, leave the end of your dowel bare.) 4. Lightly pencil a design (you can use the ones here as a guide or make up your own) and cut out. Let Matisse’s flowers inspire you. 5. “Plant” the flowers in small flowerpots, vases or repurposed bottles or jars. Pour an inch or two of sand or fine gravel into the container to anchor the stems."

Love Letter: Love Without Limitations,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/style/love-letter-newsletter-love-without-limitations.html,"Not everyone wants to be with one partner forever, even if monogamy has had a long history of being the norm in romantic relationships.

"Si espero que termine, ¿dolerá menos?",style,https://www.nytimes.com/es/2021/04/04/espanol/amor-final.html,"Comenzó con un mensaje de Facebook de un chico al que había conocido superficialmente en los comedores de la escuela primaria, por los pasillos de nuestra secundaria y —el evento principal— la clase de baile del séptimo grado. En nuestro colegio, la clase de baile era un horror especial porque los profesores no nos emparejaban, lo que al menos habría reducido la ansiedad. En cambio, a los chicos se les decía que eligieran a una chica, una experiencia humillante para las que eran elegidas hasta el final o no lo eran. En el séptimo grado, yo ya medía 1,80 metros, era la chica más alta de toda mi generación y más alta que casi todos los chicos, lo que me ponía en riesgo de estar entre las no elegidas. Pues bien, él me eligió a mí, aunque apenas nos conocíamos. Aquella clase de baile fue nuestro único encuentro significativo, del que cada uno salió creyendo que el otro había sido el salvador. Ahora ya no éramos niños en edad escolar; teníamos 27 años. Y aquí, de la nada, me llegaba un mensaje de Facebook de él recordando el trauma de que nos obligaran a aprender bailes de salón durante nuestros años más incómodos. La ansiedad de estar alineados contra la pared, esperando a ver si alguien nos elegía o si nos asignaban al azar para unirnos a otra pareja cuando los números no cuadraban. El alivio de una cara amigable para hacer la experiencia un poco menos angustiosa. Tal vez solo debía ser eso: un momento de gratitud por ser la cara amigable del otro. Pero no lo fue. Empezamos a hablar más, sobre cómo estaban nuestras vidas ahora, hacia dónde nos dirigíamos, cómo él acabó mudándose a Australia, mis planes de dar el salto fuera de Estados Unidos al año siguiente. Cuando le dije que no sabía cómo iba a llevar mi carrera al extranjero, me envió una decena de ideas diferentes. Cuando le dije que no quería perderme los hitos que tendría mi familia —bodas, bebés, etcétera— argumentó que esos hitos nunca tienen fecha de caducidad: “Vuelves para lo importante”. Cuando suspiré por la posibilidad de obtener un visado, me envió información sobre todos los lugares a los que podía aplicar y ánimos sobre lo mucho que valdría la pena. Me quitó todas las excusas. En ese momento, no tenía a nadie en mi vida que entendiera el camino poco convencional que quería tomar. Había más gente que me tiraba de la manga diciéndome que aguantara al menos hasta la última despedida de soltera, o hasta el próximo ascenso, o, según mi entonces compañero de piso, solo un año más de renta. Él fue el primero en llamarme la atención por procrastinar. Y tal vez solo debía ser eso: una chispa de inspiración de alguien que estaba haciendo lo que yo quería hacer y me animaba a seguir mis propios sueños. Pero no lo fue. Él iba a volver a Estados Unidos en unas semanas y estaría en Chicago, así que decidimos organizarnos para tomar algo y recuperar los viejos tiempos que nunca compartimos. Tomó el tren al centro de la ciudad desde la casa de sus padres en los suburbios. Su madre lo había hecho cambiarse de camisa y tomar un tren más temprano para que no llegara tarde a mi encuentro. Nos sentamos en un bar y pedimos muestras de cervezas artesanales. Él siguió a regañadientes mis reglas, que consistían en beber un sorbo de cada cerveza y votar por nuestras favoritas. Hablamos de su vida en Australia y de sus planes de ir a Nueva Zelanda y luego a la Antártida, a Irlanda, a Noruega, a Alemania y luego a las islas Malvinas. Me dio más consejos y parecía genuinamente emocionado por mí, una rara apuesta de un tipo que, a pesar de haber estado en el mismo grado en la niñez, y en la misma clase de baile, básicamente era un extraño. Me di cuenta de que me relajaba cuando estaba con él, de que podía ser yo misma sin consecuencias. Y tal vez solo debía ser eso: una minirreunión de exalumnos de la escuela secundaria. Pero no lo fue. Lo dejé en la estación de tren, diciéndole que volviera a casa sano y salvo mientras él me devolvía un “sí, señora” muy amigable. Yo deseaba que hubiera intentado besarme. Casi fue algo. Una semana y unos cuantos mensajes coquetos después, decidimos vernos una última vez antes de que volviera a su vida en Australia. Volvió a venir en tren, salimos a tomar unas copas, hablamos, luego más copas y más charla. Esta vez no me quedé con ganas de más en el andén. Se quedó a dormir y pasamos una noche estupenda. Una noche perfecta. Una noche espontánea, sin expectativas ni confusión de las primeras citas ni tiempo para pensar demasiado en las cosas. Fue cómoda y natural y simplemente sucedió. Y tal vez solo debía ser eso: una aventura de una sola noche. Pero no lo fue. Seguí esperando el momento en que él siguiera adelante con su vida. Volvió a Australia, y ahora estábamos intentando mantener el contacto a pesar de una enorme diferencia horaria, y nunca se prometió nada más. ¿Cuánto tiempo tardaría él en aburrirse? Los hombres con los que salía siempre se daban por vencidos a los dos meses, normalmente cuando decían haber conocido a alguien más. Pero con este hombre pasaron dos meses, luego seis, luego nueve, y seguíamos hablando casi todos los días. Nunca de una manera que apuntara a una relación seria, pero ciertamente como algo más que amigos. Ahora conocía su plan de 15 años, sus pensamientos sobre el matrimonio y sus relaciones pasadas, cómo pasaba los veranos en la granja, su destreza poética y su odio irracional a la película  . Él conocía mi sueño de dejar mi trabajo y viajar por el mundo, mi obsesión por la música deprimente y cada frase que me hacía sonrojar. Sentí que esto podría ser algo de verdad. Sentía que tal vez, solo tal vez, se estaba convirtiendo en algo. Esperaba que algún día tuviéramos la oportunidad de averiguarlo. Un año más tarde, en febrero de 2020, volvimos a vernos en persona, en un hotel de Chicago, una parada antes de que su siguiente contrato lo enviara a otro lugar muy lejano. Esta vez había expectativas, confusión y mucho tiempo para pensar, al menos por mi parte. Pero una vez que estuvimos juntos, me sumergí de nuevo en ese espacio cómodo. No perdimos tiempo y nos metimos en la cama. Solo salimos de la habitación para encontrarnos con el repartidor de comida en el vestíbulo. Cuando decidimos irnos a dormir, él no dejaba de comprobar si ya me había dormido; quería evitar quedarse dormido mientras yo estaba despierta. En parte, sabía que estaba comprobando si estaba en condiciones de alejarse para dormir, pues tiene el calor corporal de un oso. Al principio, le había dicho en una llamada que entendía que los abrazos empiezan a sofocar muy rápido, pero que a mí me encanta ir de la mano. Casi pude ver cómo volteaba los ojos al otro lado del teléfono. Aquella noche, fingí estar dormida durante uno de sus chequeos, así que me di cuenta cuando se separó de mí, y luego tanteó bajo las sábanas hasta que encontró mi mano y la sostuvo durante el resto de la noche. Unas semanas más tarde, el mundo vivía el confinamiento de COVID-19 y él se fue a Nueva York a trabajar como enfermero. Nuestra comunicación empezó a ser irregular, ya que pasaba muchas horas en un trabajo tan intenso que soy incapaz de entender. Y así pasaron los meses, en los que yo intentaba caminar la línea que separa los mensajes alegres y los molestos, y él respondía amablemente de vez en cuando. Y entonces ocurrió. El momento que había estado anticipando durante los primeros dos meses, luego seis, luego nueve. Conoció a alguien más. Alguien con quien estaba realmente entusiasmado y con quien podía verse viajando por el mundo y tratando de formar una relación de verdad. Así de fácil, estaba de vuelta en la estación de tren, viéndolo alejarse, preguntándome si esto era todo lo que debía ser. Otro casi algo. Desde el principio, había intentado moderar mis expectativas, diciéndome a mí misma que había un 99,999 por ciento de posibilidades de que terminara exactamente así, que él conociera a alguien más y siguiera con su vida. Después de todo, para mí nunca había   ocurrido así. Y esta relación era más complicada desde el punto de vista logístico que cualquier otra que hubiera tenido antes. Pero ese 0,001 por ciento de posibilidad nunca se había sentido tan posible. Y me di permiso de entusiasmarme con él. Y tal vez eso es todo lo que debía ser: algo que me hiciera abrir realmente mi corazón de nuevo. Porque al final, eso es todo lo que fue. Otro casi algo. Y ya estoy harta de los “casi algo”.

,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/style/women-poop-at-work.html,"There  once was a woman who walked regularly from her office in Midtown Manhattan to a hotel across the street in order to use the restroom, and that woman may have been one of us. That woman had a friend, at another office job, who carried a book of matches and a can of air freshener in her purse — more willing to set off the office fire alarm than leave any hint of odor in a public lavatory. That friend had another friend, at another office job, who repeatedly forced her body to do the deed so quickly — racing from cubicle to bathroom and back, in an effort to deflect attention from what she might be doing in there — that it led to a semi-serious hemorrhoid problem. As her former colleague put it: “She was pooping at the speed of pee.” Remember the children’s book, “ ”? It is meant to teach kids that defecating is a natural, healthy part of digestion, and it does so by illustrating a wide variety of creatures — dogs, cats, snakes, whales, hippos, little boys — happily defecating. But you know who you won’t see defecating in that book, happily or unhappily? Women.  We may be living in an age where certain pockets of the corporate world are breathlessly adapting to women’s needs — company-subsidized tampons, salary workshops, lactation rooms. But even in the world’s most progressive workplace, it’s not a stretch to think that you might have an empowered female executive leading a meeting at one moment and then sneaking off to another floor to relieve herself, the next. Poop shame is real — and it disproportionately affects women, who  suffer   . In other words, the patriarchy has seeped into women’s intestinal tracts. Let’s call it the pootriarchy.  Girls aren’t born with poo shame — it’s something they’re taught. In “ ,” the psychologist Nicholas Haslam writes that girls tend to be toilet trained earlier than boys, learning at a young age to neatly keep their bodily functions contained (our words, not his). When those girls get a bit older, they learn to pass gas silently — while boys do it loudly, and think it’s hilarious. (Yes, there is a kind of Kinsey scale to gas-passing and it goes like this: According to a study called “  that was published in a journal called “Social Problems,” adult heterosexual men are far more likely to engage in scatological humor than heterosexual women and are more likely to report intentionally passing gas. Gay men are less likely to intentionally pass gas than heterosexual women, and lesbian women are somewhere in between.) “If a boy farts, everyone laughs, including the boy,” said Sarah Albee, the author of “ .” “If a girl farts, she is mortified.” Which is not to say that anxious poopers or audible flatulators of all genders don’t exist: Indeed, a male friend of ours, a U.S. Marine, recently explained that he often changes out of his military uniform and into another while on base in order to enter an entirely different facility to use the  restroom . (He was one of three individuals who responded to a survey we sent out to 100 people, mostly women, about fecal habits at work. Even with the cloak of anonymity, apparently nobody wanted to talk about it.) But while boys and men are more likely to develop “ ,” the D.S.M.-recognized medical term for pee-shyness — theorized by some to stem, in part, from the pressure of standing next to each other at open urinals — it is women who are more likely to have “parcopresis,” the corresponding bowel movement anxiety, which is not in the D.S.M., according to a variety of fecal scholars. “The bathroom is saturated with gender in fascinating ways,” said Mr. Haslam, a professor of psychology at the University of Melbourne, who noted that women’s aversion, particularly at work, is not entirely unfounded: One unpublished study he mentions in his book found that a woman who excused herself to go to the bathroom was evaluated more negatively than one who excused herself to tend to “paperwork” — while there was no difference in the way participants viewed the men. “At one level it’s an association of women with purity,” said Mr. Haslam, referring to the double standard. “At another it’s a double standard applied to hygiene and civility, where the weight falls disproportionately on women to be clean, odorless and groomed.” Or, as one of the woman interviewed in that “Fecal Matters” study put it: “Women are supposed to be non-poopers.” For most of history, it would seem, they have fallen in line — adopting all sorts of creative ways to avoid mention, inference, acknowledgment, or God forbid, smell, even when inside the bathroom. According to Ms. Albee, in the Gold Rush days, while the men on the open range would simply find a shrub or pop a squat, prairie women would form elaborate protective circles to shield one another. “They’d all stand in a circle, facing out, holding their skirts out to the side to form a ‘wall,’” she said. “Then one at a time, they’d take turns going to the bathroom in the middle of the circle, away from prying eyes.” These days, bathroom camouflage antics look far less sisterly.  There are those who engage in  the  Flush Hush ,  which involves flushing the toilet over and over again to drown out any sound.  There is the Scatological Standoff, in which two or more women sit silently in stalls next to one another, waiting for one to break the silence and have a bowel movement first — or simply give up and retreat back to their cubicle, only to begin the same standoff an hour later.  And then there’s the Poop Dupe — when you walk into the bathroom, see a co-worker you know, and immediately beeline to the mirror to check your hair. (Because you’d rather be known as superficial than defecating, obviously.) Or maybe you just hold it. According to a , 71 percent said they go “to great lengths to avoid defecating — especially in a public washroom.” (Is it any surprise to hear that women are more constipated than men? ) Historians have long noted that public facilities were created for — and built by — men, and bathrooms are no exception. Most architects are men, most plumbers are men, and early public facilities were tailored to the white men — and then later, white women — who were engaging in public life enough to use them.  Which might help explain why nobody stopped to think that just because the square footage of a bathroom facility may be equal, that doesn’t mean you can necessarily fit an equal number of stalls. Men’s room users have the luxury of urinals and speed, while women — who must contend with things like periods, changing-tables, one-piece rompers and wiping —  , while doing so with less real estate. In Congress, women didn’t have their own bathrooms on the House floor until 2011 (2011! When there were 76 of them serving!) while those in the Senate got theirs off the Senate floor in 1993.   “I didn’t have the five minutes to get” to the restroom “and then the five minutes to get back,” Rep. Donna F. Edwards (D-Md.),  in 2011. “I would have missed a vote.” Previously, those female House members had to trek out of chambers and fight off tourists in another hall — a scene that reminded us of “Hidden Figures,” the film about the early black women scientists of NASA, who  . The scene may have been fictional, but suffice to say, women of color have had to endure much worse. And then there are the biological factors at play. According to the work of Dr. Robynne Chutkan, an integrative gastroenterologist and the author of “Gutbliss,” women’s poop anxiety might not simply be cultural or even psychological. It could be physical, as there are actually some profound differences between the female and male digestive tracts, beginning with the length of the colon, which is longer in women (Dr. Chutkan calls it the “voluptuous Venus”). “What that extra length in the colon does is create this redundancy, these sort of extra twists and turns,” . “Think of the male colon as kind of a gentle horseshoe, and the female colon as being a tangled-up Slinky.” As it turns out, the ideal position for a person to comfortably relieve their bowels — at least according to gastroenterologists — is a lot like a squat, with the knees at a 90-degree angle to the waist, and not a seated position. Which means that perhaps all of us should be investing in a  to prop up our feet, but particularly those of us with a tangled up Slinky for a colon, sitting on a toilet in an office building that was built for the height of men. Or, a better idea: We could invest in educating girls to accept their bodies as they are, along with all the smells and sounds that come with it.

That’s a whole other story. I live between the U.S. and Argentina. I’m in Wellington, Fla., which is where the pandemic caught me last year. I went to the Hamptons in the summer and Virginia for a month and then September through December, Argentina. And as of mid-January I’ve been back here in Wellington. It’s the places where I play polo and, for the most part, our polo circuit has been Covid protected, with no public and taking all the necessary precautions. February of last year. My wife and I are partners in a clothing brand called   and we were there for fashion week. She presented clothes. It’s hard to believe that New York has gone on this kind of hiatus for so long, so I miss everything: the restaurants, the New York energy, which I trust will come back eventually. I don’t want to believe that New York will never be the same. I doubt that will happen. I probably will travel less because the world requires less traveling. There are things that can be replaced by a well-organized Zoom call. I went to a board meeting in Saudi Arabia last March and it took me five days to get there, get settled, go to the meeting. When we did it this year, it took six hours and I did it from my living room in Florida. But if there’s a polo match in Saudi or a polo match in Australia, I miss that interaction one thousand percent. I don’t miss traveling 10,000 miles for a meeting. It’s hard. The energy is not there. We definitely suck in the energy when you have an audience that is really engaged and responsive. My office is the stables and the polo field, and I travel around the world with my wife and children. I’m with them almost 24/7. They’re home-schooled. So in that case, my family life didn’t change much. But my business life changed quite a bit. And I think that’s because everything in the business world happened more remotely. 26  actor, artist ,  roup,  ,  , the  ,  I’ve been moving around a lot. I quarantined in Chicago, now I’m in L.A. I’ve learned a lot. The BIPOC liberation uprisings happened all around the world at the same time as the pandemic, and there was so much to show up for. I was physically present for a lot of the uprisings, and I tried to help activists who had been arrested get released. I did some jail support out of Chicago for about a week. From home I was able to organize some fund-raisers. I managed a Covid crisis relief fund using social media and a cash app. It’s beautiful. I’m just trying to have fun where it’s safe to, and in a responsible way. And rest. We’re filming our very, very, very, very last day of “Pose,” ever, here. So I expect it to be a really hard, or just complicated, moment, but I think we’re all ready to rest. We had a great conversation, and we promoted her book that revolves around people taking more seriously the harm being done to our planet. She just seems so intensely dedicated to the preservation of our world, and it’s just really beautiful to see her fight for that in so many different ways. She’s really inspiring, and she taught me a lot. Yes! This is definitely another Roaring Twenties moment. I think we’ll come out having learned something this time, and hopefully we don’t continue to repeat the same mistakes under different names. I have so much faith in humankind and our capacity to grow. I hope so! I hope that this experience helped us to appreciate connection a little more, and in a different way. I think we take connection for granted because of the internet. And everybody thinks everything is happening on the internet, and it’s not. So many people lost loved ones, also.

My wife’s American and is from the Midwest, so we spent a bit of time over there, over the summer, especially with the kids and the holidays. But I got back here in late August. It just depends. Everything is quieter, but Chelsea is kind of opened up. The galleries have been open since September, and our museum gallery area has been open since October. The capacities are very small, but the fact that it’s happening — the fact that New York is starting to reopen live performances indoors — is so important. Communing around a live show is something that I think we’ve missed terribly. I know I’ve missed it terribly. We are social beings at our heart. I think when people get back in, if they don’t already know how much they miss it, they’re going to be reminded that it’s a deeply ingrained human activity. As a former musician and a composer, it’s been not being able to hear music live. It’s fine listening on your hi-fi at home, but you miss the magic. If you go back to the dawn of when humans emerged, the one thing that humans do without any contact from others is that they make music. If you want to get technical, there’s this kind of pentatonic scale, with five notes. And as humans, no matter which part of the world we’re born in, we make music in these five-note scales for ourselves, and for those around us. To not have that, I find is really upsetting.

I didn’t want to hold back. It was written out of pain and joy. Readers responded to that. People thought it would be a condemnation of Vogue. But it wasn’t that at all.

We raised over $5 million that night for children suffering this pandemic. I got it from my mother. When I was 10, she took my sister and me to a shelter for battered women in Colombia. While we were there, I met an 11-year-old girl, Maria. She had just given birth to her stepfather’s child. That put everything in perspective for me. Children became a priority. I made a promise to myself that if one day I was fortunate enough to have a platform, I would use it to give back. This relationship isn’t about physical beauty — it’s about encouraging young women to be bold, to celebrate women of all shapes, sizes, ethnicities and backgrounds. Until recently, I traveled a lot. I loved when I met girls in Mexico, Argentina and Spain. I love being able to speak to them in Spanish. I was at a premiere in Mexico and I heard a little girl at that event tell her mother, “See, she looks like me.” Representing my heritage is the most important role that I will ever play.

,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/style/the-awkward-art-of-office-small-talk.html,"Every  day around the world,   three billion people go to work and 2.9 billion of them avoid making small talk with their co-workers once they get there. Their avoidance strategies vary. Some will keep their headphones in and their eyes low. Others will pantomime receiving an urgent message that requires an immediate, brow-furrowing, life-or-death rapid response, which incapacitates them from doing pretty much anything else, not excluding riding in, or communally waiting for, an elevator in their office building; making conversation while heating up lunch lasagna in the office microwave; walking from the entrance of their office building to the nearest public transit stop, or to literally anywhere, unless wait, you’re also going there? Because I actually meant to pop in this fine Persian rug wholesaler. See you tomorrow! If these strategies sound familiar, if you’ve convinced yourself that avoiding small talk with co-workers is smart self-preservation, that the risk of saying something “dumb” or offensive or coming across as socially inept is not worth the reward of connecting with somebody (yes, even if that connection is a shared concern about it raining), then bad news: Your false logic could be costing you a promotion. Not to scare you or anything. Jamie Terran, a   in New York City, said that small talk between colleagues and supervisors builds rapport, which in turn builds trust. “Rapport is the feeling that allows you to extend a deadline, or overlook smaller mistakes, because it makes it easy for you to remember we’re only human. Right or wrong, building rapport through interaction with colleagues could be the thing that gets you the promotion or keeps you in the role you’re in.” Building rapport applies when you’re interviewing, too. People hire people they want to work with, not necessarily who’s perfect for the job. Engaging in small talk with your interviewer helps make a positive impression. But, how? Small talk, while small and just talk, is intimidating. This is 2019 and we’re all anxious about something, including a 15-second chat with Janet from accounting about how freaking cold the A/C is in the conference room. The good news is that you can just go ahead and repurpose your anxiety about making small talk with your co-workers and worry instead about   making small talk with your co-workers. See? Easy switch. Because while small talk can be torture, the absence of it can also make us feel bad about ourselves, like we’re true failures at life for not being able to connect with a fellow member of the herd, worried deep down that we will be kicked out of society and left to rot alone on the plains, to pay for our own streaming services instead of sharing a login. Here are a few thoughts on how to avoid that feeling. A   showed that people “systematically underestimated how much their conversation partners liked them and enjoyed their company.” Think about it: when you have an awkward small talk interaction with a co-worker (it’s stunted, there were silences, neither of you could think of something to say) do you normally go back to your desk and think, “Wow, Alex is a terrible conversationalist”? No. You go back to your desk and think, “Wow, I’m a rotten garbage human being who should be shunned from society.” And Alex is thinking the same thing about him or herself.  Point is, you’re more likable than you think you are, so try not to judge yourself so harshly. According to Ellie Hearne, founder and C.E.O. of the leadership communications agency  , which, among other services, teaches companies and executives how to have better internal communications, “people don’t remember what you say — they remember how they felt when they were with you.” If you’re generally anxious in social situations, i.e. human,  Ms. Terran  suggested coming up with core questions or stories from which you can pull. “Whether or not you share personal information about yourself is up to you, but discussing things you truly care about is always the best strategy,” she said. “Topics relating to your professional field, for example, an article you saw or book you read, is a great place to start.”  Did something weird or interesting happen to you recently?  Workshop  (in your mind, at least) that story ahead of time to unveil at your next office outing. And definitely remember to ask questions. We’re all ultimately pretty narcissistic at heart.  The ping-pong of “How are you? Good, how are you?” can feel like a waste of time and energy, but be the change you wish to see in the world and break the cycle. Go to your inner Rolodex of topics (see: planning ahead) and move the short conversation forward by replying   you’re “good.” As in, “I’m good. I just started a book/podcast/TV show and I’m really enjoying it. Have you heard of it?” Or mention something office-related, where there’s a shared common experience: “I’m good. They restocked the cold brew in the kitchen and it’s so strong. Have you tried it?”  Small talk doesn’t last long. “If you’re a generally anxious person, you have an out — you’re at work! You’re not supposed to spend too much time chatting. After a few moments you can reference a meeting or project you are supposed to work on,” Ms. Terran advised. A simple exchange of pleasantries followed by a concise but polite exit (“Have a good day!”) is perfectly acceptable.  If you’re having a bad day and don’t want to talk, that might be best for everyone involved. Enter  . “It’s fine to take a step back from engaging. Most people know the new workplace etiquette, à la earbuds in means ‘give me some space,’” Ms. Hearne said. A simple smile or nod to acknowledge your co-worker will still go a long way. I’ll leave you with a warning: There are very few ways to have successful small talk in the office bathroom. It should go without saying that attempting to chat with someone while they’re in the bathroom stall is totally off-limits.  That said, one of the more memorable (in a good way) office chitchats I’ve ever had happened at the bathroom sink. A co-worker who was clearly excellent at storing away fun facts and sharing them appropriately told me about the “ ” method of using a paper towel to decrease waste.  I have used the method, and used it as a small talk device, ever since. Lindsay Mannering was a founding team member of   and writes from Brooklyn, NY."

It’s a great way of finding connection. I miss the serendipity of bumping into people, crossing paths in a spontaneous way. Some of our best conversations used to take place in an elevator or on our way out the door. Those random things that are the fabric of our lives are so greatly diminished. The computer screen has no texture. Our lives have no texture. That is why we’re so drawn to cooking and eating right now. Those things bring smells, texture and physicality into our lives. That feeling of baking bread, of turning over the dough, that doesn’t happen on a screen. It can. Our attendance is pretty strong. I find people come because they feel they can be safe, but also be with other people again, even if they are standing 15 or 20 feet away. I believe much of what happens, happens through the art itself, through the voices of the artists.   our big public art project with David Hammons, will appear in May. It is an open structure, a ghost version of a pier shed that used to exist on the Hudson. In many ways, it is an aspirational project, about reparations. It’s symbolic of the resilience of New York.

When I go out, I just want to rush back home. I feel safer at home. I feel very content. We read more, go for walks with our dog — he’s a chocolate Lab. We enjoy sitting down and eating meals together, which we never did. The pandemic has brought us solitude, as well as time together and moments of reflection. This was an important year for me as an artist, a productive one. I had to let go of my usual rituals. I learned to use my iPhone to make small photographs. Until now, all of my work has been about Iran or other Middle Eastern countries. This year, for the first time, I decided to turn my lens on America. My idea was to capture images of Americans, to show an immigrant’s perspective about this country, the good and the bad. I will give a personal tour of the show at a  benefit next month. We traveled in the Navajo Nation in Farmington, New Mexico. I focused on Native Americans who have been violated, treated poorly. As a Muslim, I was able to identify with that trajectory. It was very emotional for me, as an immigrant, to be able to go into center of America and understand how much anxiety there is. This work is really a conversation about the anxiety that people share. We made a movie, “Land of Dreams,” with Isabella Rossellini, Matt Dillon and Sheila Vand.

It was his duty,   during a sojourn in France, to “ study  politicks and war,” that the next generation “may have the liberty to study mathematicks and philosophy,” that the next should have “the right to study Painting, Poetry, Musick, Architecture, Statuary, Tapestry and Porcelaine.” Mr. Adams’s epistle ending there, modern readers cannot know whether, with more paper and time, he would have eventually previsioned the 21st-century corporate campus where word clouds are studied in both digital and material states so that the current youngest generation of workers may attain a perfect knowledge of Cinnabon brand identity. We can only assume that when, in a separate letter written three years earlier, in the midst of the Revolutionary War, he expressed his wish that posterity would “ ” the liberty he sought, he had in mind something like the  62,000 -square-foot headquarters of Focus Brands, the Atlanta-based  operator of  6,536   food franchise locations. Behind every snack food franchise is a story — a young mother raised in the Amish church takes over a pretzel stand in the wake of devastating personal tragedy; a flat tire on a hot day forces a Greek immigrant ice cream man to serve a rapidly softening frozen product — that is eventually obscured by the unrelenting popularity of its low-cost, high-indulgence, addictively delicious treats. Behind every Cinnabon Classic Roll is an office of people dedicated to preserving its legal status, ingredient consistency, financial viability, informative yet friendly online presence, uniformity of storefront appearance, marketing power and cultural legacy.  Not to mention designing, photographing, printing, filming and distributing the materials that make it possible for anyone of legal working age in the United States to acquire the knowledge of Cinnabon Classic Roll fabrication in accordance with company standards. Ditto a Fudgie the Whale ice cream c ak e or an Aloha Pineapple smoothie. Roughly 375 such individuals work in the main office of Focus Brands. Focus  owns and governs the Auntie Anne’s, Carvel, Cinnabon, Jamba (formerly Jamba Juice), McAlister’s Deli, Moe’s Southwest Grill and Schlotzsky’s brands. In its offices, these have been boiled down to their very essences and those essences in turn splashed upon the walls, suspended from the ceiling and drilled into the exposed concrete pillars.  The most arresting manifestation of these brands is the floating text that hovers in altocumulus formation above a brightly lit walkway off the building’s main entrance. “Creamy frosting buttery AWESOME irresistible HOMEWRECKER,” declare (some of) the words, which Steven DeSutter, the C.E.O., said, were chosen by brand leaders to “give them a chance to say what words define your brand.” (“Homewrecker” is a type of burrito at Moe’s.)  Closer inspection reveals the text’s hues are not the standard  ROYGBIV  rainbow array, but reflective of the idiosyncratic palette of Focus Brands: Cinnabon turquoise, Auntie Anne lapis, the oxblood standard of Carvel.  The colors signify that here are employed the diplomats who bring Cinnabon to Pizza Hut and to Egypt; the researchers who have determined that the sticky bun recipe should be less sweet in Asia to appeal to consumers; the men and women who photograph “milkshakes” made of mashed potatoes and crushed up Oreo cookies that exactly resemble Carvel milkshakes, but do not melt. Mr. DeSutter’s aims in creating a new headquarters for Focus —  designed in 2015  by  Gensler , one of the world’s largest  architectural  firms (it also worked on a recent redesign of the New York Times offices) — were twofold: to fortify connections between the siloed brands, and to create an environment attractive for millennial workers. To that end, he directed his head of human resources to seek input from young Focus employees. “I said, ‘They will be your primary adviser group, because I want to make sure that whatever we build, we build with  Generation Y, Z  as a primary interest in mind, because I’m building for the future. I’m building for the next generation,’” Mr. DeSutter, 65, recalled. “Because believe me, baby boomers were not going to get excited about having no walls in an office. So there was no reason to ask them what they wanted, because they’re going to tell you they wanted high cubicles or walls in an office.” Erin Greer, 38, a director of Gensler Atlanta’s Workplace Studio who contributed to the project, said that a challenge of multigenerational office design is to create a “space that doesn’t alienate anyone” while bearing in mind that corporate clients typically acquire their spaces under leases of at least 10 years, a time span in which employee demographics can shift “drastically.” “Another underlying layer is how people are educated,” Mrs. Greer said. “Traditionally education happened in a very rigid kind of form. And now when you go into schools at whatever level, it’s much more collaborative and solution oriented. And that, I think, has led to some of the evolution you see in the workplace and how people are taught to interact with each other and work and problem solve across industries.” A Montessori offi ce . What did Focus’s millennial advisers call for in the workplace of their dreams? A pool table, which never materialized because of lack of space, according to Mr. DeSutter. The desired swing sets in conference rooms  installed, suspended from sturdy metal chains, giving said rooms a louche corporate pleasure dungeon vibe.  Most have now been removed (“they’re easy to fall out of,” one employee said), but two remain — black accents in a lime green meeting room (lime carpet, lime upholstered benches, lime walls) where varieties of potato chips offered at McAlister’s are listed on the walls in concentric circles of jumbo text.  Besides bright colors, silver stools that resemble tree stumps, and unexpected graphic presentations of food-related adjectives, Gensler and Focus’s aesthetic feast for millennial tastes manifests primarily in the layout: open and collaborative.  Research on the merits of open offices is mixed. Gensler company literature suggests a majority of “knowledge workers” prefer “some sort of” open plan, while some studies have found that open offices imperil employees’  ,   and “ .” Whether for good or for ill, they are prevalent.  Proponents cite their shared, common windows as a major advantage over cubicle warrens. These airy, symmetrical, light-and-glass-filled spaces that stretch to the near horizon are indeed beautiful, in much the same way the ninth floor of the Asch building in Manhattan — its large windows casting luxuriant light onto its open work area from their generous southern exposure —  was beautiful, until the afternoon of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire.  This is not to imply that the Focus offices, which conduct regular fire and shelter-in-place drills, are in any way unsafe, merely that they provide the kind of dreamy access to natural light that designers have pursued for centuries. Nor is it intended to portend ill for, or in any way curse, the work force of Focus, a presumably representative sample of whom were, on a recent visit, welcoming, good-humored, eager to share knowledge and friendly. Nor is that intended to imply Triangle seamstresses lacked such qualities. At Focus, most work spaces are structured around so-called bench seating, where employees are seated on chairs at long communal tables, with individual spaces demarcated by low partitions.  Singular features abound on the premises, like the thousands of little glass balls that hang from what looks like threads of the finest spider’s silk, arranged into the word “FOCUS” on the executive floor. Then there are the test kitchens.  Here, on a recent Wednesday morning, Cinnabon’s  lab-coat-clad  executive chef Jennifer Holwill, 41, scrutinized smears of caramel spread before her on parchment paper for purposes related to “risk management.” (The risk: a DEFCON 2 scenario wherein Cinnabon’s caramel manufacturer would be rendered unable to produce the vast quantities of caramel required to satiate a nation.)  It is in these miniature commercial kitchens that new products are researched and designed (with the notable exception of menu items from Auntie Anne’s, whose test kitchen and creative facilities are based out of a historic former post office in Lancaster, Pa., for reasons that seem largely to hinge on the undeniably accurate tautology that Auntie Anne’s is “a Pennsylvania-based company”).  It is here where a limited-time offering like a Cinnabon Churro Frosting Sandwich can be tweaked to such perfection that the Dr. Frankensteins who created it are left with no choice but to prolong its life indefinitely, incorporating it into menus as a permanent feature.  Ms. Holwill said that colleagues have offered to buy fresh-baked samples from her — verboten, as test kitchen chefs are only allowed to offer samples (should they care to offer samples) first come first served. (The nearest location where Cinnabon MiniBons can be legally and ethically purchased by employees is a mall roughly 15 minutes away.)  But because it is 2019, some of the most urgent work in the building is done by the social teams. A major force of Focus public relations is Marissa Sharpless, a virtuosically engaging senior manager of social media and P.R. for Cinnabon who, speaking off the cuff, paints a brand picture of such depth and volume that it rivals any by Caravaggio.  Mrs. Sharpless, 34, can keep watch over Focus’s byzantine, constantly updating social channels on the building’s ground floor, where a wall-mounted TV displays social interactions. It is possible here to observe in real time as people direct their ire, daydreams and profane, improbable questions @JambaJuice, @Schlotzskys, @AuntieAnnes.  Through a deft series of clicks, Mrs. Sharpless summoned a page of graphics onto her laptop screen. Here was the world’s collected knowledge (or at least articulated Twitter observations) about Cinnabon over the past month, broken down into hashtags, emoji clouds, choropleth maps of the United States, pie charts, bar graphs, line graphs and days of the week (Cinnabon typically “pops” on Tuesdays).  There was also some kind of something where purple was supposed to stay high because purple was sentiment and, said Mrs. Sharpless, a rise in conversation coupled with a drop in sentiment is “the last thing you want to see.” The top emojis people had felt about Cinnabon were crying laughing, sobbing, heart eyes and anguished. Words and phrases were assigned a color: green for positive emotions (“crave”), red for negative ones (“not that great”). Upstairs, Robby Ayala, 28, a social media manager for Moe’s Southwest Grill, maintains the brand’s Instagram, Twitter and Facebook accounts. He said the most difficult aspect of his job was coming up with unique content about Moe’s every day. “I try to tweet once a day. That’s a lot more challenging than it sounds,” he said, and laughed. The difficulty isn’t in coming up with an appealingly irreverent tweet to share with fans of Moe’s (a task many could likely accomplish) but in thinking of another one the next day, and another the day after that, and another the day after that, hundreds — potentially thousands — of times in a row, without repeating or embarrassing yourself. “If you jump in inappropriately, you will get roasted,” he said, reflecting on the recent Twitter storm over Popeyes’ Spicy Chicken Sandwich. “Like Zaxby’s  . Boston Market  . Chick-fil-A  . ” Mr. Ayala’s job is, essentially, to talk about Moe’s in a brief, hilarious and charming way, without stopping, forever. He found delirious success one day this summer when   combining a meme about aliens in Area 51 with the very notion of Moe’s burritos received roughly 2,100 retweets. But then he had to tweet again. Maintaining the high corporate standards of some of America’s iconic snack foods in 2019 demands stamina, adrenaline, a commitment to unironically observing National Lemonade Day, high levels of organization and good cheer.  It also requires a willingness to work in a space bursting with digital screens, where, for the general population, all but the most essential walls have been eliminated, and the resulting din camouflaged with pink noise pumped in from ceiling speakers — which is to say, it’s not for everyone. In his own office, Mr. DeSutter recalled one worker who, years ago, faced with the impending renovation, “said, ‘I’m not going to be able to work in this environment,’ and they left.” That wasn’t the only staff member with reservations. Another employee, who Mr. DeSutter described as long tenured, asked him, “‘Aren’t you worried that you’re going to ruin the company?’” “I remember, on the first day we moved into this building,” Mr. DeSutter said, “when that particular individual sat down at their open desk, I sat beside him for a few minutes and said, ‘This is going to be O.K.’” He stayed."
Seashell Art and Rock Gardens,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/26/style/seashell-art-and-rock-gardens.html," 50  journalist :  ,  , the  , the  ,  I have spent most of the past year in my apartment on Central Park South. I remember looking out at the park in March and April last year; it was totally empty, totally silent. If you live in New York you learn to live with, and even appreciate, the sounds of the city. The silence was deafening. Sometimes it was broken by ambulance sirens. You knew every time you heard that what it meant. When I finally emerged about a month later, I did a very long walk in the park. It felt so restorative. You don’t realize until you’re deprived of it, how much you appreciate fresh air. For the next few days my legs really hurt. But it felt great to be outside. I used to say I get my greatest inspirations in the morning. I would always think of the best way open a piece in the shower. Now I find myself sitting in front of the laptop thinking, “When is it going to come?” Sometimes it comes at 2 in the morning. Anyone who knows me or even thinks they know me might assume I can’t boil an egg. That was pretty much the case. I used to be terrified in the kitchen. Now I find it relaxing and therapeutic. I’ve found a passion for cooking. I make a mean pizza and a mean batch of brownies, too. And I can whip up a bucatini all’Amatriciana — a tomato sauce with pancetta and spices. I’ve bought more cookbooks than anything else. If you can read, you can cook. I can’t ignore that Asians are under attack. It’s immensely sad — and terrifying. I’m especially fearful for the elderly. My mother has been staying with me. I tell her to wear sunglasses when she goes out, I often try to do the same. It doesn’t have to be this way, and, yet, here we are. I never thought I would say this, but I’m looking forward to a big fancy party and getting dressed up again, seeing people in tuxedos, drinking, chatting, dancing and all of that. People say that it will be like the Roaring Twenties when the pandemic is over. Maybe. But it seems to me that all of this has forced us to slow down. I hope the days of being double and triple booked on a single night are over. : 28 : creative arts blogger; founder,  ; art collector   ,  ,  I’ve been in Manhattan since September in our apartment in the Village. I’m in the eighth month of my pregnancy so I’ve been isolating myself out of pure caution. It’s been hard for me and everyone. The last year has felt like a minute and a century in one. It’s still weird to me to be writing the date 2021. There hasn’t been much expected of me in the sense of socializing. It’s been a blessing to be thinking less about myself and more about my child. I have a lot of friends who are pregnant. For people who’ve led fast-paced lives, this has been an opportune time to nest. One of my guilty pleasures has been vintage shopping. I love the shopping on the RealReal app — I check it on the iPhone incessantly. But I’m lucky to have a creative outlet. I paint brand logos on seashells. My first was Supreme. I like the way they throw their logos on bricks or fire extinguishers. My husband, who is an art dealer, suggested different brands. I went on to Hermès, Ikea, Oreo and Pringles. I sell my shells at the Webster, the Gagosian bookstore and on my  . If my shells were to be mass produced, there might be. But my hand-painted, one-of-a-kind pieces are considered original art objects. There are copyright clauses that protect people like me. I’ve always thought of myself as a creative person but never an artist. But I have been able to chart my progress. I have definitely become a better painter. That people are actually buying my work is a sign they are taking me seriously. A thousand percent. When Jeff Bezos announced that he was stepping down as C.E.O. at Amazon, it was a mirror effect of last year when he announced that the pandemic had pushed him to take on more responsibility. That he feels he can step away — to me, that is an amazing sign. The vaccine rollout has alleviated a lot of people’s fears. When you go outside and the city is alive, you actually feel a sense of hopefulness.  45  artist   ,  ,  ,  I’m in a little house in the Rocky Mountains, looking at giant drifts of snow that look like a herd of animals in white fluffy blankets. All the trees look like their hairs, you know. Earlier this year I was in upstate New York a lot, camping in a van. The pandemic has influenced and amplified the time we are spending in nature. I made a rock garden out of boulders. I’ve been learning to listen to the sounds of the ice forming on the lake. I’ve spent a lot of time looking for rocks in rivers. Rocks have been around for millions and millions of years. Holding one is like having a time machine in your hand, as if it contains the condensed stories of civilizations that have risen and fallen, all packed into this tiny form of matter. I’m one of those souls who finds little distinction between making art or making the world a more just and equitable place. When I say “art” I mean music and cooking, science and theater, all of these things that create bridges between people. I would like to think those are important not just for artists, but for bricklayers, chefs, designers or plumbers — for everybody. The way I make art, it’s all part of social practice, the practice of being alive. Lockdown perhaps makes you go deeper with fewer people. That’s certainly something I’ve experienced. I’ve been thinking a lot about psychedelics. New frontiers are being forged, which could help a lot of people suffering right now. I have a little related project that will come to light soon. I’m working on some bronzes about emergence and transformation, the combobulation of many forms. In the last decade I spent a lot of my life being social and building Pioneer Works. It was nice to have a moment of real pause. But we are opening up at the beginning of April with our   and I’m grateful for that."

What Are the Benefits of Probiotics?,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/style/self-care/probiotics-benefits.html,"Walk  into a health food store, or even a drugstore, and you’re likely to find an entire aisle, maybe two, dedicated to probiotics. Probiotics are live micro-organisms, usually bacteria,  that provide health benefits  when consumed at  appropriate doses .  According to some  surveys , approximately   Americans take probiotics, which are available as pills, powders, foods and drinks. Probiotics are a huge industry — at least a   one, according to Zion Market Research — and popular brands   for 35 cents to $1 a dose, with a shelf life of several months. Proponents argue that they improve the composition of the gut microbiome, which is involved in many aspects of health including  ,   and  . Framed this way, probiotics may seem like a no-brainer. But before you reach  for your wallet, k eep in mind that while many scientists and doctors believe that probiotics have promise, they also say that a lot of products on the market don’t live up to the hype.  “The current evidence does not convince me to recommend probiotics for any of my healthy patients,” said Dr. Pieter Cohen, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and an internist at Cambridge Health Alliance.  In a   of the scientific literature on probiotics published in  January 2019 , researchers concluded that “the benefits and feasibility of  probiotic consumption in healthy adults remain uncertain.”  Recent research has raised questions about how well probiotics are tested for safety, too. Some clinical studies suggest that certain probiotics can help in certain contexts. According to the  , the probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 can  help treat  irritable bowel syndrome (I.B.S.), while Saccharomyces boulardii, a yeast, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG can each reduce the risk of diarrhea in adults taking antibiotics.  Specific probiotics have also been shown to help treat pouchitis, ulcerative colitis,   and infectious diarrhea, and to reduce the risk of developing Clostridium difficile infections after taking antibiotics. To understand the various contexts in which probiotics could be useful, check out   recommended by Gregor Reid, a microbiologist and immunologist at Western University in Ontario, Canada, and the  former  president of the industry-funded International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP ), although some products on the list are backed by more research than others.  And no matter what the science says, probiotics sold as dietary  supplements a re not disease-treating drugs. If companies want to market their probiotics as medical treatments, they have to pursue a  of Food and Drug Administration approval to market them as live biotherapeutic products. Thus far, no probiotics   this designation. With probiotics, details matter. It’s silly to walk into a drugstore, grab a probiotic off the shelf and think it’s going to do you any good.  Be wary, too, of recommendations made by people who haven’t consulted the scientific literature. “Don’t blindly trust a pharmacist, doctor, health-food shop attendant or dietary book, as sadly, most are ill informed,” Dr. Reid said.  But if a doctor you trust recommends a particular strain that has been shown in clinical studies to help your condition, or if you have identified a strain that is backed up by solid clinical research and really want to give it a try, then sure, go ahead — after double-checking with your doctor first. Don’t expect miracles, however. There is still the question of whether some probiotics stick around long enough in the body to do anything.  In a 2018   published in Cell, a team of scientists gave  , a mixture of 11 bacterial strains commercially available in Israel, to 10 healthy people for four weeks and found that the probiotics passed right through four of them.  This suggests that in some people, these strains “will not have an effect,” said Eran Segal, a computational biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and a co- author  of the study.  Studies aside, though, the other major problem with probiotics is that they may not contain what they say they do.  In the United States, the F.D.A. regulates most probiotics as dietary supplements, which means that their manufacturing and quality-control standards  are far less stringent than standards for prescription and over-the-counter drugs.  In a 2016  , researchers at the University of California-Davis and other institutions used DNA analysis to compare the bacterial strains listed on the labels of 16 commercially available probiotics with what the products actually had in them.  The researchers found that only one of the 16 products contained the strains listed on the label; some had entirely different bacterial species. Good quality control matters: In 2014, a premature baby   from what was believed to be mold contamination in a probiotic supplement. Moreover, some probiotics don’t even say what strains they purportedly contain or how many colony-forming units are in each dose (a measure of how many viable bacteria each dose contains), because the F.D.A. doesn’t require it.  As a result, consumers  “need to do a lot of homework,”  Dr. Reid said, in order to make informed decisions. They will need to hunt for brands that include this information on the label, and cross-reference the labels with their doctors’ recommendations or published research. Ideally, they should take the dose shown to work in clinical studies.  by Dr. Reid mentions a handful of foods that have been shown to provide benefits: some Activia, Goodbelly, DanActive and Yakult drinks and a few infant formulas.  Keep in mind that some yogurts and fermented foods don’t contain live micro-organisms, and that even when they do, these bacteria may not do anything useful.  “Unfortunately, misuse of the term ‘probiotic’ has also become a major issue, with many products exploiting the term without meeting the requisite criteria,” according to a 2014 ISAPP   statement published in the journal Gastroenterology & Hepatology. Some doctors recommend taking probiotics  after a course of antibiotics  as a way of jump-starting microbial regrowth in the gut, but a   in Cell questioned the wisdom of that practice.  Researchers found that the same probiotic mixture, Bio-25, colonized the guts of a small group of healthy people who had recently taken antibiotics, but that those who took Bio-25 then regrew their normal gut bacteria more slowly than people who didn’t take Bio-25.  The Cell studies were small, though, and their findings apply only to the Bio-25 product; no one knows whether other strains have similar effects.  And this brings up another important point:  Every probiotic strain is different , and one strain’s effects have no bearing on others. Put another way, probiotics “cannot be generalized,” Dr. Reid said.  It takes time, not to mention lots of money, to amass the evidence needed to blanket-recommend a product for a large swath of the population. (After all, doctors   over whether healthy people should take multivitamins.)  Thus far, many clinical studies on probiotics have been small, poorly designed or difficult to interpret. Many have focused on short-term outcomes, rather than looking at long-term effects (in part because long-term trials are so expensive). Moreover, a 2018   published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that probiotic t rials often do not  report adequate safety  data,  particularly when it comes to potential side effects, which raises questions about whether probiotics are as safe as they have been made out to be.  Among other things, Dr. Cohen wrote in a 2018  , since probiotics are live organisms, they could potentially spread dangerous antibiotic resistance genes among people’s gut bacteria — although, thankfully, there is   that this has happened  in humans .  Still, if one thing is clear about probiotics, it is that we need more high-quality research to determine how safe and effective the products on store shelves are."
What Is the Keto Diet and Does It Work?,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/style/self-care/keto-diet-explained-benefits.html,"A recent   of registered dietitians named the low-carbohydrate keto diet yet again as the most popular diet in the United States. Powering this diet is fat, and loads of it — all the way up to a hefty 90 percent of one’s daily calories. Its fans (and marketers) feed social media with before and after photos, crediting the diet for life-altering weight loss or other effects. They swirl butter into their coffee, load up on cheese and eat lonely burgers without their bestie: the bun. Staples like whole grains, legumes, fruit and starchy vegetables are being largely pushed off the plate as devotees strive for ketosis — when the body begins to burn fat instead of glucose as its primary energy source. “America is in a state of carbophobia,” said Whitney Linsenmeyer, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The diet is hailed for dropping pounds, burning more calories, reducing hunger, managing diabetes, treating drug resistant epilepsy, improving blood pressure and lowering cholesterol, as well as triglycerides, the major storage form of fat in the body. People have reported improved concentration, too. “We see pretty dramatic benefits,” said Dr. William Yancy, director of the Duke Diet and Fitness Center. First, a word: Choosing an eating plan or an approach to eating is very personal. Everyone’s body, tastes and background are unique. The best approach to food intake is one in which you are healthy and nurtured and which matches your social and cultural preference. If you want guidance, it’s recommended you consult with a registered dietitian. A “typical”   consists of at least 70 percent of calories derived from fat, less than 10 percent from carbs and less than 20 percent from protein. The ketogenic diet, long used to treat epilepsy in children, calls for 90 percent of daily calories to come from fat, with the amount of protein or carbs varying as long as it’s 4 grams of fat for every combined 1 gram of carb and protein, according to the American Epilepsy Society. That can mean chowing down on a lot of cheese, butter, eggs, nuts, salmon, bacon, olive oil and non-starchy vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, greens and spinach. For the arithmetic-challenged, apps and online programs can do the math for you. (No matter what, the keto diet is vastly different than the USDA dietary   of 45 to 65 percent of one’s total calories to be carbohydrates, 20 to 35 percent from fat and 10 to 35 percent from protein.) The goal of the ketogenic diet is to enter a state of ketosis through fat metabolism. In a ketogenic state, the body uses primarily fat for energy instead of carbohydrates; with low levels of carbohydrate, fats can be converted into ketones to fuel the body. For ketosis, a typical adult must stay below 20 to 50 grams of net carbohydrates — measured as total carbs minus fiber — each day. Crossing that threshold is easy: a thick slice of bread adds 21 carbohydrates, a medium apple 25 and a cup of milk 12. “It’s very restrictive,” said Carla Prado, an associate professor and director of the University of Alberta’s Human Nutrition Research Unit. It’s not just bread and soda that are on the outs but high-sugar fruit and starchy veggies like potatoes, as well as too much protein. Also, dieters have to be on high alert for hidden carbs, often invisible to the eye, yet coating that seemingly keto-friendly fried cheese. Yes. Certainly in the short-term, it appears that way. For the first two to six months, there’s evidence that a very low-carbohydrate diet can help you lose more weight than the standard high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet, according to a new literature   of low-carb diets by the National Lipid Association. “By 12 months, that advantage is essentially gone,” said Carol F. Kirkpatrick, director of Idaho State University’s Wellness Center, and lead author of the new literature review.  After that, weight loss seems to equalize between those two popular diet regimens. She said keto was best used to kick-start a diet, before transitioning to a carb intake that you can adhere to for the longer term. For some, it’s the promised land of diets. Instead of cringing through carrot sticks, they can fill up guilt-free on chorizo with scrambled eggs. Indeed,   suggests that people feel less hungry while in ketosis, and have fewer cravings.  “That’s why it’s become so popular for the general population,” said Dr. Mackenzie C. Cervenka, medical director of Johns Hopkins Hospital’s Adult Epilepsy Diet Center. “Because once you are in ketosis, it’s easy to follow.” Usually, it takes between one to four days to enter the state, doctors say, but it depends on many factors like activity level: a runner, for example, may sprint there faster than a couch potato.  The keto diet appears to deliver fast results: The first pounds may seem to slip off. That can be seductive but it’s likely water weight. Then, dietitians say, it’s back to energy in minus energy out. You can absolutely gain weight on any diet if you’re consuming 5,000 calories a day, according to Dr. Linsenmeyer, who is also director of Saint Louis University’s Didactic Program in Dietetics.  “It’s not like it is going to magically alter your metabolism to where calories don’t matter anymore,” she said. And when resuming the carbs, that water weight returns. There is some evidence that it can. The research is limited and conflicting here too. It may be a very small effect, and not meaningful for weight control. That’s what one   found. In it, 17 obese or overweight volunteers moved into metabolic wards for two months and had every last spoonful of food monitored. (This recounting of the science uses definitional terms like “obese” to be clear about the subjects of research studies.) For the first month, they consumed a high-carb diet; for the second, they had a ketogenic one, with both plans equal in calories.  “We fed them every morsel of food that they ate,” said Kevin Hall, integrative physiology section chief for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases’ Laboratory of Biological Modeling. “There were no cheat days.” In the end, though the participants’ insulin levels did decrease while eating the bunless burger, the subjects didn’t lose more fat than when they had bread. The study was limited, though, by having a small sample size, and not having a comparison group that wasn’t on the back-to-back regimens. For some, a low-carb diet can be appealing. That doesn’t mean that diet is superior, according to a study that followed 609 overweight adults on either a low-carb or a low-fat diet for a year. In the end, both groups shed almost the same amount on average — about 12 to 13 pounds, according to the randomized clinical   that examined a low-carb diet less restrictive than the keto. The take-home message? “You can succeed on both,” said Christopher Gardner, the lead author and a professor of medicine and nutrition scientist at Stanford Prevention Research Center. It’s not known yet. “If you tell people to go on this diet forever and for a longer term, there is no evidence,” said Dr. Prado, of the University of Alberta who co-authored a   on the ketogenic diet as a possible therapy for cancer. The diet does help children with epilepsy: Nearly a third to two-thirds of patients experience   fewer seizures after six months on the regimen. (Even back in   people fasted to treat epilepsy. And the ketogenic diet itself is nearly a century old, having been popular to help with seizures until the discovery of an anticonvulsant drug.) There are case studies on how   with a rare condition fared on the diet for a decade, but most well-designed studies in this field have not extended beyond two years. Yes. “Carbohydrate is the biggest driver of blood sugar,” said Duke’s Dr. Yancy, who sees a lot of promise in the diet helping those with diabetes. A new   enrolled 263 adults with Type 2 diabetes into group medical visits, with half receiving medication adjustment for better blood sugar control, and the others undergoing weight management counseling using a low-carb diet. (All participants of the study had a BMI that fell within the range of overweight or obese.) Both groups experienced lowered average blood sugar levels at the end of 48 weeks, according to findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association Internal Medicine. However, the weight management group on the low-carb diet slimmed down more, required less medication and had fewer problematic low blood sugar episodes. For those with Type 2 diabetes, a low-carb diet seems to improve average blood sugar levels better in the first year than the high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. After that time period, the review by the National Lipid Association found that difference almost disappears — but with a very important benefit: the low-carb participants were able to use less medication. “People like that because they don’t like to be on diabetes medicines,” Dr. Yancy said.  When Dr. Cervenka of Johns Hopkins Hospital starts her patients with epilepsy on a low-carbohydrate diet, she doesn’t rule out saturated fats from animal products. She wants them to get used to the new way of eating. But if cholesterol levels climb and stay that way, she advises them to shift to foods and oils with mono- and polyunsaturated fats like avocados or olive oil. While the diet’s effect on LDL (“bad” cholesterol) appears to be mixed, the National Lipid Association’s review found that a very low-carbohydrate diet does seem to improve HDL (commonly known as the good cholesterol). Beyond a year, it seems these benefits don’t last, much like in weight loss. Only lowered triglyceride levels seem to have any staying power. Other findings: The evidence on blood pressure is inconsistent, and the reports of improved mental clarity are not supported by controlled studies. And what happens, for example, after cutting down fruits, legumes and whole grains — all food that   point to reducing cardiometabolic risk?  Dr. Neil J. Stone, a preventive cardiologist at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, worries about this, having seen the bad cholesterol levels of some of his patients on the keto diet increase drastically. (It doesn’t happen to all but it does happen to some.) “Any diet that raises major risk factors for coronary heart disease puts patients at risk over the long term,” he said. (There’s also much   about LDL particles and whether the type that’s increasing with the keto diet, larger LDL particles, doesn’t increase heart disease risk.) An   Dr. Stone co-authored by the American Heart Association stated that lowering dietary saturated fat, like fatty meats and high-fat dairy, can be beneficial. And swapping it for unsaturated fats like safflower oil or olive oil may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. But before going on any diet, he recommends you ask yourself: What are your goals? Are they short-term or long-term? Can you get there without taking as many risks? There are many ways to interpret the keto diet. Some people will eat a salad with chicken, dressed in olive oil, while others will feast on stacks of bacon washed down by diet soda, the kind of diet known as “dirty keto.” That’s eating anything, including processed foods, as long as your carbs are low enough and your fat high enough to achieve ketosis. The best diet is one that works for you, but if you want to try this, they recommend avoiding trans fats like margarine, limiting saturated fat by consuming lean cuts of beef and skinless chicken breast and incorporating fatty fish like salmon into your diet. Reach for foods high in unsaturated fats like avocado, nuts, seeds and olive oil. Stanford’s Dr. Gardner also says he sees one common misconception about keto: eating too much protein. Most amino acids in protein foods can be converted into glucose in the body, undermining efforts to keep carb intake low. “It drives me nuts that people don’t get it,” he said when he sees people eat, for instance, steak after steak. At first some can experience some stomach issues and GI distress. “Ninety percent of calories from fat is probably going to be a shock to the system,” said Dr. Linsenmeyer. It’s crucial, doctors say, to consult with a dietitian or physician, have cholesterol levels regularly checked, and replenish the fluids and sodium lost by increased urination and the severe restriction of carbohydrates. If not, within two to four days of beginning the diet, that depletion can bring on the “keto flu” — symptoms like dizziness, poor sleep and fatigue in some people.  “Carbohydrates have a lot of nutrients that can help us maintain our body function,” said Dr. Prado. On the diet, some people experience “keto breath,” a halitosis likely caused by the production of acetone, which is one of the ketone bodies. Possible   for patients with epilepsy starting the diet include constipation from reduced fiber intake, vomiting, fatigue, hypoglycemia, worsening reflux and increased frequency of seizures. The National Lipid Association review urges that patients with lipid disorders (like high cholesterol or triglycerides), a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (such as having a heart attack or stroke), heart failure and kidney and liver disease take caution if considering the diet. People on blood thinners should take extra care. Advice from the battling diet camps can be confusing. But Dr. Hall of the National Institutes of Health said there is a middle ground: “Can we get beyond this low-fat, low-carb diet wars, and look to where people have this common piece of advice?” He said some versions of both the low-fat and keto diets can be healthier than the standard American diet, which is known as  for a reason. Low in  , it’s filled with prepackaged foods with additives, added sugars and unrecognizable ingredients. Keto isn’t the only way to lose weight or change your life, obviously. Dietitians say it is not essential to cut back on as many foods, since a moderate low-carb diet may still hold   for diabetes or weight loss.  One thing is certain: Any meaningful change starts with behavior. Are you at a right point to make a change in your life? Dr. Yancy suggests asking friends and family to support you, confer with a doctor, incorporate physical activity and begin to think of it not as a temporary measure but more of a lifestyle change. Whichever eating plan one chooses for 2020, Dr. Hall said certain recommendations are nearly universal: cut down on refined carbs and  , and consume more whole foods, particularly non-starchy vegetables, such as broccoli, asparagus and spinach. “It may be the ‘optimal diet’ lies somewhere between what has been proposed historically — meaning the high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet — and the ketogenic diet,” said Dr. Cervenka.

Is Coffee Good for You?,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/style/self-care/coffee-benefits.html,"We’ve come a long way from the cans of Folgers that filled our grandparents’ cupboards, with our oat milk lattes, cold brews and Frappuccinos. Some of us are still very utilitarian about the drink while others perform elaborate rituals. The fourth most popular beverage in the country, coffee is steeped into our culture. Just the right amount can improve our mood; too much may make us feel anxious and jittery. Yes. In moderation, coffee seems to be good for most people — that’s 3 to 5 cups daily, or up to 400 milligrams of caffeine. “The evidence is pretty consistent that coffee is associated with a lower risk of mortality,” said Erikka Loftfield, a research fellow at the National Cancer Institute who has studied the beverage. For years, coffee was believed to be a possible carcinogen, but the 2015  helped to change perception. For the first time, moderate coffee drinking was included as part of a healthy diet. When researchers controlled for lifestyle factors, like how many heavy coffee drinkers also smoked, the data tipped in coffee’s favor. A large 2017 review on coffee consumption and human health in the   also found that most of the time, coffee was associated with a benefit, rather than a harm. In examining more than 200 reviews of previous studies, the authors observed that moderate coffee drinkers had less cardiovascular disease, and premature death from all causes, including heart attacks and stroke, than those skipping the beverage. In addition, experts say some of the strongest protective effects may be with Type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, and liver conditions such as cirrhosis, liver cancer and chronic liver disease. For example, having about five cups of coffee a day, instead of none, is correlated with a 30 percent decreased risk of Type 2 diabetes, according to a meta-analysis of 30 studies. The potential benefit from coffee might be from the polyphenols, which are plant compounds that have antioxidant properties, according to Dr. Giuseppe Grosso, an assistant professor in human nutrition at University of Catania in Italy and the lead author of an in the Annual Review of Nutrition. However, coffee isn’t for everyone. There are concerns about overconsumption. This is especially true for expecting mothers because the safety of caffeine during pregnancy is unclear. While the research into coffee’s impact on health is ongoing, most of the work in this field is observational. “We don’t know for sure if coffee is the cause of the health benefits,” said Jonathan Fallowfield, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, and co-author of the British Medical Journal review. These findings could be due to other factors or behaviors present in coffee drinkers.” Yes. Do you prefer a dark or light roast? Coarse grinding or fine? Arabica or robusta? “All of these different aspects affect the taste, but also affect the compounds within the coffees,” said Neal Freedman, a senior investigator with the National Cancer Institute. “But it’s not clear at all how these different levels of compounds may be related to health.” Roasting, for example, reduces the amount of chlorogenic acids, but other antioxidant compounds are formed. Espresso has the highest concentration of many compounds because it has less water than drip coffee. A   in JAMA Internal Medicine examined the coffee habits of nearly 500,000 people in the U.K. and found that it didn’t matter if they drank one cup or chain-drank eight — regular or decaf — or whether they were fast metabolizers of coffee or slow. They were linked to a lower risk of death from all causes, except with instant coffee, the evidence was weaker. The way you prepare your cup of joe may influence your cholesterol levels, too. “The one coffee we know not suitable to be drinking is the boiled coffee,” said Marilyn C. Cornelis, an assistant professor in preventive medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and co-author of the JAMA Internal Medicine study. Examples of this include the plunge-happy French press, Scandinavian coffee, or Greek and Turkish coffee — the kind commonly consumed in the Middle East. (When poured, the unfiltered grounds settle on the tiny cup’s bottom like sludge. To peek into the future, elders in the region have a tradition of reading the sediment of an overturned cup, like a crystal ball.) However, the oil in   has cafestol and kahweol, compounds called diterpenes. They are shown to raise LDL, the bad cholesterol, and slightly lower HDL, what’s known as the good kind. “If you filter the coffee, then it’s no issue at all,” said Rob van Dam, a professor at Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at National University of Singapore. “For people with cholesterol issues, it’s better to switch to other types of coffee.” He’s been studying coffee for two decades. (And, yes, he’s had a lot of coffee in that time.) However, other researchers say not to throw out the boiled coffee just yet. The clinical significance of such small increases in cholesterol may be questionable, given that it’s not associated with an increase in cardiovascular deaths. Many consumers have also swapped loose grounds for coffee pods. While there are environmental concerns with single use pods, researchers believe them to hold the same benefits as, say, drip coffee. The latter applies to cold brew, too, but more research is needed. No. Espresso has the highest concentration of caffeine, packing about 70 milligrams into a one-ounce shot, but is consumed in smaller quantities. By comparison, a typical 12-ounce serving of drip coffee has 200 milligrams of caffeine, more than instant’s 140. And, yes, brewed decaf has caffeine, too — 8 milligrams — which can add up. When buying coffee, you never really know what you’re going to get. At one Florida coffee house, over a six-day period, the same 16-ounce   fluctuated from 259 milligrams all the way up to 564 — which goes beyond federal recommendations. But for some of us, knowing how much caffeine is in our coffee can be especially important. You’ve probably noticed it before. How a friend can pound quadruple espresso shots at 10 p.m. and sleep afterward, while you can’t have any past noon, or you’ll be watching “Seinfeld” reruns until dawn. Some of us have a polymorphism, a genetic variant that slows our metabolism for caffeine. It’s these individuals that Dr. Grosso recommends limit their refills. “They take a coffee, and then they have the second and the third, and they still have the caffeine of the first,” he said. You can even   through a variety of direct-to-consumer testing services, including 23andMe.  Evidence suggests there can be a reliance on the drink, and tolerance builds over time. Withdrawal symptoms include a headache, fatigue, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and depressed mood. Indeed, caffeine is a psychoactive drug, and coffee is its biggest dietary source. About a half-hour after sipping a cup of joe, the caffeine kicks in, and is quickly absorbed. Blood vessels constrict. Blood pressure increases. A moderate amount of caffeine can wake you up, boost your mood, energy, alertness, concentration and even athletic performance. On average, it takes four to six hours to metabolize half the caffeine. For those knocking back more than 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, there’s not enough evidence to assess the safety, according to the Dietary Guidelines.   can lead to caffeine intoxication, with its shakiness, nervousness, and irregular heartbeat. Caffeine is also   with delaying the time it takes for you fall asleep, how long you stay there, and the reported quality of that shut eye. “I think that caffeine is so common and so ingrained in our culture, and daily habits, that we often don’t think about it as a potential source of problems,” said Mary M. Sweeney, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Cutting down coffee may help with gastroesophageal reflux, too. A   found that women drinking caffeinated beverages — coffee, tea, or soda — were associated with a small but increased risk of symptoms, like heartburn. The study’s authors predicted fewer symptoms when substituting two servings of the drinks with water. Current available research hasn’t determined what amount of caffeine can be safely consumed during pregnancy, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Caffeine does cross the placenta so some doctors may recommend pregnant women stay below 200 milligrams of coffee daily. Extremely high doses of caffeine can be   But researchers say that’s more likely to occur accidentally with caffeine powder or pills. “You don’t see a lot of people going into the emergency room because they accidentally drank too much coffee,” said Dr. van Dam. Inside the red fruit of  lie two coffee beans. Green in color, the duo spoon together, the rich brown hue to appear only after roasting. In fact, they aren’t beans at all. “It’s like a cherry, you pick off the tree,” said Patrick Brown, a professor of plant sciences at University of California, Davis. Unlike the cherry, though, the seed is the prize, and the flesh is discarded. In addition to caffeine, coffee is a dark brew of a thousand chemical compounds that could have potential therapeutic effects on the body. One key component, chlorogenic acid, is a polyphenol found in many fruits and vegetables. Coffee is also a good dietary source of vitamin B3, magnesium and potassium. “People often see coffee just as a vehicle for caffeine, but, of course, it’s a very complex plant beverage,” said Dr. van Dam. With  estimated 124 species, most of flavors remain untapped; and perhaps will be forever, with an estimated 60 percent under threat of extinction, largely from climate change, disease, pests and deforestation. What fills our mugs at cafes, the office, and on road trips are from two species: arabica and canephora, known as robusta. Arabica fills specialty cafes, and costs more than robusta, which fuels instant coffees and some espressos. For all of the pomp swirling around arabica, the fact remains it is an extremely homogeneous little seed. Almost all of the world’s arabica coffee progeny traces itself back a few plants from Ethiopia, coffee’s birthplace, or Yemen. Doctors don’t know. One 2015   found that those adding sugar, cream or milk had the same associated benefit as those who preferred it black. But the coffee industry has exploded since the ’90s when the older adults in the study filled out their dietary history. “It was only about a tablespoon of cream or milk, and a teaspoon of sugar,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Loftfield, with the National Cancer Institute. “This is very different, potentially, than some of these coffee beverages you see on the market today.” Sweet coffee and tea are the fourth largest source of sugar in the diets of adults, according to the October survey from the U.S.D.A. That includes dessert-like beverages, like Dunkin’ Donuts’ 860-calorie creamy frozen coconut caramel coffee drink, with 17 grams of saturated fat, and 129 grams of total sugars. Experts say some of these drinks bear little relation to the 2-calorie cup of black   of the past, worrying health officials. “When you talk about a drink that has that load of unhealthy fats and that much sugar, can’t possibly be a healthy beverage on balance,” Dr. Jim Krieger, a clinical professor of medicine and health services at the University of Washington. “That amount of sugar alone is astronomical compared to the current recommendations of U.S. Dietary Guidelines of 50 grams of sugar a day.” The concern is heightened, experts say, especially because an estimated 43 percent of teens are now drinking coffee — nearly doubling since 2003 — according to the research firm Kantar, driven partly by sweet drinks. “People should worry a lot about what they put in the coffee and what the food and beverage industry puts in it,” said Laura Schmidt, a professor at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine. “And sweetened coffee is one of the things that the beverage industry is pushing on the public now that consumers have turned away from soda for health reasons.” Depends on your goals in life. If you are enjoying the drink in moderation, doctors say continue onward, and savor those sips. And for those patients with a sensitivity to the beverage, Dr. Sophie Balzora, a gastroenterologist, weighs the benefits and risks very carefully. The clinical associate professor of medicine at N.Y.U. School of Medicine understands its cultural significance, and knows to tread lightly. As she put it: “Robbing people of their coffee seems cruel.”"
,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/fashion/hms-supply-chain-transparency.html," sells an estimated three billion articles of clothing per year. Its revenue makes it among the top three fashion retailers in the world. Clothing for its brands, including H&M, Arket and & Other Stories, is manufactured in 40 countries, the company said; in Bangladesh alone, it sources from 275 factories that employ half a million workers.  As it sprawls ever farther around the globe, hopping from trend to trend, how can H&M keep track of how the skirts, pants and sweaters it sells are made? How, for example, can it monitor whether, in faraway countries,  , forced to work hours of overtime in precarious conditions? This spring, after almost three years of preparation and coordination by 40 team members from Hong Kong to Stockholm, and at a time when   and its shadowy supply chain is greater than ever, H&M introduced an effort to do exactly that — and to make it public for shoppers. Now, the company says, it can be held accountable for the origins of its products. If consumers care to look. Browsing the H&M website this month, you may find yourself taken with a   written on the front, or else a pair of  , with smiling bunny faces and ears that stick out from the knees for $4.99. Click on the “product sustainability” tab on the page, and you will learn they were made in Bangladesh by some of the 13,000 workers at the Jinnat Apparels & Fashion plant in Gazipur, a dense manufacturing neighborhood near Dhaka. This is part of the company’s new “consumer-facing transparency layer.” H&M shoppers can now find out not only the country where clothing was manufactured, but also details on materials and recycling, the name of the supplier or authorized subcontractor where a garment was made; the factory address; and the number of workers employed there.  Customers shopping in physical stores can also have access to this information by using the H&M app to scan the product price tag. There are limits to how much information you’ll get, of course. The sustainability tab won’t tell you that Jinnat sprawls over seven floors, each the size of a football field, or that employees perch in front of whirring sewing machines making white cotton T-shirts, monitoring 337 high-tech embroidery appliances and snipping at stray threads.  And you won’t find out that this single company makes 400,000 pieces (roughly 110 tons) of clothing per day, or around 10 to 12 million units per month, up to a quarter of which will be bound for H&M.  Nevertheless, it is the first effort of its kind by a retailer of this scale. H&M created the system by building a bridge between its supplier and production databases and then linking it to its retail interfaces. (The company declined to say what the project cost.)  Pascal Brun, the head of sustainability for the H&M brand, said the new public transparency layer showed that the company had nothing to hide regarding labor or environmental practices, or how H&M products were made. “It is not going to change the world,” he said. “But it is about building a foundation for real change, given we can’t build this industry from the ground up all over again.” “Transparency has become the key driver of change in the fashion industry, which used to be about as untransparent an industry as it could possibly be,” said David Savman, the head of production for the H&M group, from a factory floor in Dhaka.  Tanned and golden haired, the Swede filed between rows of workers and inspected sequined T-shirts, asking line managers about different cotton hybrids and admiring fire doors. Change came crashing down on the industry with the  , a factory collapse that led to the death of more than 1,000 workers, with scores more disfigured or disabled for life.  In the wake of the catastrophe, several Western retailers found they had sold clothes sourced from the factory, or had little to no idea where the clothes they sold were sourced from. All have since come under increasing public pressure to investigate, police and invest in exactly where and how their products were made.  There is also pressure for them to be as transparent about their findings as possible (though some have been far more forthcoming than others about taking action). The creation in Bangladesh in 2013 of two five-year fire and safety monitoring agreements between retailers and unions made significant improvements and reforms.  The Accord on Fire and Building Safety, which is legally binding, was signed by more than 200 retailers including H&M and Inditex (neither of which had any ties to Rana Plaza, but plenty of other alleged supply chain abuses). The other agreement is the nonbinding Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which was signed by Walmart, Gap and Target.  Both have spurred improved working conditions in many Bangladeshi factories, and calls for other countries to adopt similar standards. These agreements,  , have sidelined some of the country’s most dangerous factories, and cut their ties to most Western retailers, though not all. A   in October found that Amazon continued to sell clothes from Bangladeshi factories that other retailers had blacklisted because of their inability to pass safety requirements.  Pressure from consumers has also prompted brands like H&M to proactively support local suppliers who create safe and profitable businesses in places like Bangladesh. “We choose not to work with a lot of suppliers that other rivals work with so they can save on costs,” said Karl-Johan Persson this fall. (In 2018 six suppliers in Bangladesh were phased out by H&M because of their poor sustainability performance.)  Mr. Persson, the billionaire chief executive of H&M, sat in the   for the company’s army of young designers in Stockholm as he defended his family company’s business model and its contributions.  He declined to specify how much H&M spent annually on transparency efforts, other than to say the investment had continually hurt short-term profit in order to ensure the long-term survival and growth of the company.  His argument is that by working in low-cost areas, H&M is creating jobs and investing in the economy; by making its partnerships public, it is accepting its own liability. “But often,” Mr. Persson said, “the focus ends up on what we don’t do.” The new “transparency layer” project has been cautiously applauded by some human rights and fashion advocacy groups and union leaders. But many have also said that H&M’s efforts do not go far enough, questioning whether improvements like this are worthwhile if they merely prolong the existence of a system where profits and shareholder interests are continually placed ahead of employees, suppliers and the environment. Currently, customers do not have access to information on workers’ wages at individual factories, or local minimum fair living wage commitments and calculation methodology. Nor does the transparency layer offer a breakdown of the pricing structure that could specify how labor costs are calculated. “Transparency is primarily a means to an end, and mere information about where a garment is produced does not automatically guarantee meaningful changes in factory labor conditions,” said Aruna Kashyap, senior counsel for the women’s rights division at Human Rights Watch, which is part of a coalition that started the   (of which H&M is a signatory). “H&M is among the leaders on supplier transparency, and other companies should follow this practice,” Ms. Kashyap said. “But that doesn’t mean that H&M and other companies that are transparent have fixed an industry model that is replete with problems.”   Even after the Rana Plaza tragedy, the global business   remains the same. Most brands don’t own their own production facilities, but instead contract with independent factories to make their garments. Generally, in these factories, located in mostly developing economies, very low wages are paid to workers using manufacturing processes that are geared toward expediency rather than the environment. Subcontraction or homeworking remain common, and make it even harder to track where clothes come from. The industry is operating at an almighty scale. In total, across the fashion industry, 80 billion garments are produced each year,  , with consumer demand and appetite for trend-fueled fashion only growing stronger, in part thanks to a   and the wallets of a young emerging global middle class.  The worldwide apparel and footwear market’s expected growth, pegged at roughly 5 percent through 2030 by Euromonitor analysts, would risk “exerting an unprecedented strain on planetary resources” by raising annual production of fashion to more than 100 million tons, according to a  . The pressure to meet those demands, and the demand for ever-cheaper labor, are at odds with the move toward transparency and tightly managed supply chains. Many major brands in Europe and North America continue to have limited information about the factories and workers producing their wares.  Inspections are usually delegated to third-party auditors, which have proven to be far from foolproof and at the mercy of the often uneven tides of developing nations. Revelations of egregious failures within the garment industry still emerge on a regular basis. A Guardian story in October reported that the active wear company   where Bangladeshi female factory workers said they were assaulted.  This month, in Delhi, India, a fire broke out in a factory that made school bags and killed 43 workers, including children, who were asleep on the floors inside. Last year, Transparentem, a nonprofit focused on investigating human and environmental abuses in the apparel industry, published   and forced labor at a set of Malaysian apparel factories that made wares for brands in North America and Europe such as Primark, Asics, Nike and Under Armour. According to the Transparentem report, many workers, often migrants from Bangladesh and Nepal, said that they paid steep recruitment fees to acquire jobs. These could take years to pay back, resulting in “debt bondage,” a common form of modern slavery that occurs when a person is forced to work to pay off debts for little or no pay. Factories limited employees’ movements by withholding their passports; it wasn’t unusual for them to live jammed together in squalid conditions. Many also had to pay a government levy on foreign workers out of their own paychecks (a practice that was legal when Transparentem interviewed workers in 2016 and 2017). “The physical distance, cultural distance, and often time zone difference have all meant that there are inherent challenges in understanding the labor conditions in any manufacturer supply chain,” said Benjamin Skinner, the founder and president of Transparentem. Brands have largely trusted suppliers to follow certain rules with employees and the environment and then verified that those policies were being followed, Mr. Skinner said.  But based on his organization’s work, he added, “the ‘verify’ part can be pretty weak.” Because auditors would alert factory owners to their visits, or only interview workers in the presence of their bosses, it created an  . This gap between intent and reality also emerged in a May report from University of Sheffield researchers in Britain on apparel companies not delivering on promises to pay workers a living wage. Generally set by governments (sometimes with input from foreign and local businesses, unions and NGOs),  , with benchmarks sometimes geared to maintaining a country’s competitiveness as a low-cost manufacturing destination rather than the needs of workers.  The wages can also be significantly less — sometimes even falling below the poverty line — than the living wage as defined by outside groups, which broadly incorporates food, housing, medical care, clothing and transportation. Many companies, including Adidas and Puma, referred to components of a living wage in their supplier codes of conduct, the researchers said, but the wording around requirements was “very vague,” leaving fulfillment an option and the legal minimum wage the only requirement. On top of all this, the researchers noted that companies relied heavily on outside auditors to ensure codes of conduct were being followed, running into the same issues outlined by Mr. Skinner.  Many of these firms are “beholden by financial conflict of interest since they are hired by companies who could decide not to continue to hire them if they identify too many problems,” they wrote. Often, they visited only top suppliers, leaving out the many subcontractors where abuses can be the worst. After Transparentem revealed the Malaysian abuses to 23 companies with direct or indirect buying relationships with the factories, most said that they would take action. Buyers and suppliers were able to negotiate the return of passports and secure the reimbursement of recruitment fees for workers at several facilities. (By November 2018, the total amount of fees paid and scheduled to be paid exceeded $1.4 million.) Still, under the current system, the industry status quo means major garment manufacturers are mopping up mistakes, rather than not making them at all. This is the problem H&M is trying to solve. Mr. Savman of H&M said that because H&M did not own factories, all sustainability efforts and investments like a Dhaka training center ultimately focused on supporting and promoting processes and mechanisms between suppliers, unions and workers that made them self-sufficient when it came to problem solving. A self-reporting system called the Supplier Partnership Impact Program allowed H&M to see issues and regulate what sort of monitoring was needed and where. National Monitoring Committees — round table discussions between H&M employees, union representatives and factory owners — attempted to resolve pay disputes and abuse allegations at factory level. Alongside regular auditing by independent groups, Mr. Savman said, H&M still frequently sent its own employees to monitor factories, sometimes by prearrangement but often unannounced.  His colleague Payal Jain, the sustainability manager for H&M’s global supply chain who started her career as a factory worker in India, said that H&M visited its factories several times per week, and 2,500 audits were made in the country per year. That may sound like a lot, but it is an average of 10 per factory — in 365 days. Or less than once per month. The company   last year, which said H&M had not met a 2013 commitment made to ensure suppliers would pay a living wage to 850,000 textile workers by 2018.  (H&M said it had reached at least 600 factories and 930,000 garment workers with its fair living wage strategy, and did not share the Clean Clothes Campaign’s view of how to create change in the textile industry.) Additionally, some factory owners say that despite support from H&M’s sustainability teams, they experience pressure from the company or from production teams who still want more product at a cheaper price — or they threaten to pull their business and go to even less expensive hubs, like Ethiopia.  Ms. Jain said cost of labor was not a negotiable part of a supplier contract. But if suppliers are paid less, or overtime is required to complete a contract, the likelihood is that shortfall will get passed down the chain. “Brands like H&M offer training, help union members establish themselves in my factory and guide us on investing in the business, which are all very good and important things,” said Lutful Matin, the manager of Natural Denims, another factory near Dhaka. It employs 6,900 workers to make garments for H&M, Zara, Mango and Esprit.  “But then their buying teams still drive down order values and I feel such pressure,” Mr. Matin said. He had proudly shown off the conditions and quality of his products. But, he said, while “I know I’ve invested more in my factory than competitors, they still get orders. There are always new certificates and alliances that need to be passed. Globally the trading market is getting tougher. Sometimes I don’t know how easy it will be to survive.” While the work it does is recognized by its recognition in projects like  , H&M believes the best way to get consumers thinking about who made their clothes is to talk to them close to the point of sale. “Consumers have a lack of trust and say they don’t always know how to make the right choices,” said Anna Gedda, the head of sustainability for the H&M group. She added that it was “a constant struggle” to work out how much information a customer may want versus what might make them switch off or walk away from a sale. From Dhaka, Mr. Savman was more forthright. “We are still at the stage where if you put two T-shirts, one cotton and one recycled cotton, which is 30 percent more expensive, the majority of consumers will still take the first option,” he said. “We put a lot of information out there, like the product transparency layer. But how much do customers engage with it? Not a lot — yet.” Nearby, the managers and owners were keen to show off the scope and quality of their Jinnat complex, from their high-quality Italian knitting machines and subsidized food store and medical facilities to the anonymous complaint boxes on every floor and payment system so that workers can be compensated directly and efficiently.  As tens of thousands of workers streamed back into the steamy streets for their lunch break, Abdul Wahed, the chairman, looked on. “We are extremely proud of the factory here, and the work we have done,” he said. “People can know when and where we make their clothes.” The onus is on them to click."
,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/business/fashion-nova-underpaid-workers.html,"LOS ANGELES — Fashion Nova has perfected fast fashion for the Instagram era.  The mostly online retailer leans on a vast network of celebrities, influencers, and random selfie takers who post about the brand relentlessly on social media. It is built to satisfy a very online clientele, mass-producing cheap clothes that look expensive. “They need to buy a lot of different styles and probably only wear them a couple times so their Instagram feeds can stay fresh,” Richard Saghian, Fashion Nova’s founder, said in an interview last year.  To enable that habit, he gives them a constant stream of new options that are priced to sell. The days of $200 jeans are over, if you ask Mr. Saghian. Fashion Nova’s skintight denim goes for $24.99. And, he said, the company can get its clothes made “in less than two weeks,” often by manufacturers in Los Angeles, a short drive from the company’s headquarters.  That model hints at an ugly secret behind the brand’s runaway success: The federal Labor Department has found that many Fashion Nova garments are stitched together by a work force in the United States that is paid illegally low wages.  Los Angeles is filled with factories that pay workers off the books and as little as possible, battling overseas competitors that can pay even less. Many of the people behind the sewing machines are undocumented, and unlikely to challenge their bosses. “It has all the advantages of a sweatshop system,” said David Weil, who led the United States Labor Department’s wage and hour division from 2014 to 2017. Every year, the department investigates allegations of wage violations at sewing contractors in Los Angeles, showing up unannounced to review payroll data, interview employees and question the owners. In investigations conducted from 2016 through this year, the department discovered Fashion Nova clothing being made in dozens of factories that owed $3.8 million in back wages to hundreds of workers, according to internal federal documents that summarized the findings and were reviewed by The New York Times. Those factories, which are hired by middlemen to produce garments for fashion brands, paid their sewers as little as $2.77 an hour, according to a person familiar with the investigation.  The Labor Department declined to comment on the details of the investigations. In a statement, a spokeswoman said the department “continues to ensure employers receive compliance assistance with the overtime and minimum wage requirements, and the Wage and Hour Division is committed to enforcing the law.” After repeated violations were found at factories making Fashion Nova clothes, federal officials met with company representatives. “We have already had a highly productive and positive meeting with the Department of Labor in which we discussed our ongoing commitment to ensuring that all workers involved with the Fashion Nova brand are appropriately compensated for the work they do,” Erica Meierhans, Fashion Nova’s general counsel, said in a statement to The Times. “Any suggestion that Fashion Nova is responsible for underpaying anyone working on our brand is categorically false.”  In 2018, Mr. Saghian said about 80 percent of the brand’s clothes were made in the United States. Fashion Nova’s supply chain has shifted since then, and now the brand says it makes less than half of its clothes in Los Angeles. It would not specify the overall percentage made in the United States.  The company does not deal directly with factories. Instead, it places bulk orders with companies that design the clothes and then ship fabric to separately owned sewing contractors, where workers stitch the clothes together and stick Fashion Nova’s label on them. The brand’s clingy dresses and animal-print jumpsuits are often made by people like Mercedes Cortes, working in ramshackle buildings that smell like bathrooms. Ms. Cortes, 56, sewed Fashion Nova clothes for several months at Coco Love, a dusty factory close to Fashion Nova’s offices in Vernon, Calif. “There were cockroaches. There were rats,” she said. “The conditions weren’t good.” She worked every day of the week, but her pay varied depending on how quickly her fingers could move. Ms. Cortes was paid for each piece of a shirt she sewed together — about 4 cents to sew on each sleeve, 5 cents for each of the side seams, 8 cents for the seam on the neckline. On average, she earned $270 in a week, the equivalent of $4.66 an hour, she said. In 2016, Ms. Cortes left Coco Love and later reached a settlement with the company for $5,000 in back wages. She continued to work in factories sewing Fashion Nova clothes, noticing the $12 price tags on the tops she had stitched together for cents. “The clothes are very expensive for what they pay us,” Ms. Cortes said. “Consumers can say, ‘Well, of course that’s what it’s like in Bangladesh or Vietnam,’ but they are developing countries,” Mr. Weil said. “People just don’t want to believe it’s true in their own backyard.” For all their seediness, these factories are still producing clothes for major American retailers. Under federal law, brands cannot be penalized for wage theft in factories if they can credibly claim that they did not know their clothes were made by workers paid illegally low wages. The Labor Department has collected millions in back wages and penalties from Los Angeles garment businesses in recent years, but has not fined a retailer. This year, Fashion Nova’s labels were the ones found the most frequently by federal investigators looking into garment factories that pay egregiously low wages, according to a person familiar with the investigations. In September, three officials from the department met with Fashion Nova’s lawyers to tell them that, over four years, the brand’s clothes had been found in 50 investigations of factories paying less than the federal minimum wage or failing to pay overtime.  The company’s lawyers told the officials that they had taken immediate action and had already updated the brand’s agreement with vendors. Now, if Fashion Nova learns that a factory has been charged with violating laws “governing the wages and hours of its employees, child labor, forced labor or unsafe working conditions,” the brand will put the middleman who hired that factory on a six-month “probation,” it said in a statement.  The working relationship would continue, unless workers file another complaint against the same factory or another one that the contractor hired during those six months. At that point, the brand will suspend the contractor until it passes a third-party audit.  While Fashion Nova has taken steps to address the Labor Department’s findings, Ms. Meierhans, the brand’s general counsel, noted that it works with hundreds of manufacturers and “is not responsible for how these vendors handle their payrolls.” Mr. Saghian opened the first Fashion Nova store in 2006, in a Los Angeles mall. Seven years and four storefronts later, he realized that he was losing customers to online outlets selling the same clothes. A web developer talked him out of starting a website; it would get no traffic, because no one knew what Fashion Nova was. Mr. Saghian had a better shot on Instagram, where “there were some really basic boutiques that had 300,000 followers,” he said in the interview. In 2013, Mr. Saghian opened an Instagram account and began posting photos of his clothing on mannequins and customers. He noticed that some of his stores’ regular visitors were influencers he had seen on Instagram, where they had hundreds of thousands of followers. “I had rappers’ girlfriends, female rappers, models,” he said. Mr. Saghian started giving them free clothing, and they posted photos of themselves draped in Fashion Nova garb. In turn, he reposted their photos and tagged their handles. “Everyone wants to be famous. Everyone wants to have more followers,” Mr. Saghian said. “By tagging them, the influencer would grow their following.” Gradually, the strategy brought Fashion Nova from the outskirts of the internet into the mainstream. The brand earned mentions on hip-hop tracks. In 2017, its sales grew by about 600 percent.  Cardi B, the Grammy-winning rap star, unveiled her first collection with the brand in an Instagram video in November last year. “I wanted to do something that is like, ‘Wow, what is that? Is that Chanel? Is that YSL? Is that Gucci?’ No,” she said, adding an expletive, “it’s Fashion Nova.” All 82 styles in Cardi B’s collection sold out hours after they became available. She posted another video the same night, promising a full restock “in two or three weeks.” (Cardi B’s line is made in Los Angeles, but the government has not found any of the clothes in factories where workers have alleged they were paid less than the minimum, Fashion Nova said.) There were more searches for Fashion Nova last year than for Versace or Gucci, according to Google’s year in search data. It has 17 million followers on Instagram, and at any given moment there are enough people browsing clothes on its website to fill a basketball arena, Mr. Saghian said.  To keep them interested, Fashion Nova produces more than a thousand new styles every week, thanks in part to an army of local suppliers that can respond instantly to the brand’s requests. “If there was a design concept that came to mind Sunday night, on a Monday afternoon I would have a sample,” he said. Many of the people vying for Mr. Saghian’s business occupy glass-walled storefronts jammed into the six frenetic blocks of the garment district in downtown Los Angeles. These are the companies that design clothing samples and sell them in bulk to Fashion Nova and other retailers. Those businesses outsource the job of making clothes to nearby factories that work as subcontractors. In November, The Times visited seven companies that got Fashion Nova clothes made in factories that underpaid workers, according to the Labor Department investigations. Some spoke freely about their work with the brand. Others refused to comment or talked on the condition of anonymity, fearing that they might lose the company as a client if they went on the record. The five owners and employees who agreed to be interviewed said Fashion Nova would always push to pay the lowest price possible for each garment, and would demand a quick turnaround.  “They give me the best possible price they can give it to me, for that will allow them to still break a profit,” Mr. Saghian said. The companies can negotiate with Fashion Nova, but their power is limited. A dwindling number of retailers are still doing business in Los Angeles, and a couple of big orders from Fashion Nova can keep a small garment shop afloat for another year. So they look for subcontractors who can sew clothes as quickly and cheaply as possible. Amante Clothing, which occupies a stuffy storefront filled with racks of colorful samples, regularly works with Fashion Nova. The brand paid Amante $7.15 per top for a bulk order last year, according to a Labor Department investigation conducted last December. Amante then went to a sewing contractor called Karis Apparel, which made the tops. Amante paid Karis $2.20 to sew each garment, the Labor Department found. Fashion Nova sold the top for $17.99. “We don’t own the sewing contractor, so whatever the sewing contractor does, that’s his problem,” said a designer at Amante, who declined to be named for fear of losing her job. “We don’t know what they do to give us the lowest price. We assume they’re paying their employees the minimum.”  Karis, the factory that worked with Amante, went out of business in April. Another manufacturer ensnared in the investigations moved production to Mexico this year. But many more factories have evaded punishment. When Teresa Garcia started working at Sugar Sky, it was called Xela Fashion. It was 2014, and Xela Fashion, state records show, was owned by Demetria Sajche, a woman whom Ms. Garcia was told to call Angelina. Several months later — Ms. Garcia does not remember how many — the name on her checks had changed, though she worked in the same grungy factory in the heart of downtown, a few blocks from a SoulCycle. Now her employer was called Nena Fashion, a company that was founded by Leslie Sajche, a relative of Ms. Garcia’s boss, according to business records filed with California’s secretary of state. About a year after that, the name changed again, to GYA Fashion.  In 2017, the factory moved to an industrial stretch of Olympic Boulevard in East Los Angeles and began using a  new name: Sugar Sky. About a year later, Ms. Sajche stopped running the day-to-day operations and handed the job over to Eric Alfredo Ajitaz Puac, whom workers knew as her boyfriend. Ms. Garcia said that she believed the point of all the name changes was to avoid being shut down by federal or state officials. Several workers, including Ms. Garcia, have filed claims against Xela, Nena, Gya and Sugar Sky for back wages with California’s labor commissioner, the state agency that handles such disputes.  In her claim, which is active, Ms. Garcia included checks showing she earned as little as $225 for 65 hours of work in a week, the equivalent of $3.46 an hour. She remembers the factory’s receiving orders from Fashion Nova for up to 5,000 pieces of clothing at a time.  “They needed it so fast, they couldn’t wait,” Ms. Garcia said of the brand. “We would need to turn it around within a week.”  Weeks of trying to reach Mr. Puac and Ms. Sajche were unsuccessful. A trip to Sugar Sky’s last known location just before Thanksgiving found a furniture store. Neighbors said the garment factory had packed up and moved out two months earlier. Fernando Axjup, who was listed as an owner of one iteration of the factory, agreed to an interview. He was recently fired from the company and had filed his own claim for back wages. “They keep changing their names so they don’t have to pay people,” Mr. Axjup said. “There was a lot of exploitation.” As a manager, he had access to payroll data and said Ms. Garcia rarely earned the minimum wage. Mr. Axjup suggested that perhaps he had been fired for standing up for workers like Ms. Garcia. Ms. Garcia said she doubted that, given that Mr. Axjup was the one ordering her to hurry up. He said he could never figure out why Fashion Nova did not visit the factory floor to check on how its clothes were being made for such low prices. “Supposedly, the brand should supervise the people who give them work, to find out whether they are being paid well,” Mr. Axjup said. “But they never do. They never came to see.” Kitty Bennett contributed research. "
Nurturing the Next Fashion Leaders,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/22/style/scene-city-virgil-alboh-aerin-lauder-darren-walker.html," 40 fashion designer, artist, musician, entrepreneur I’ve been spending most of my time in my studio on the North Side of Chicago. Digital conferencing has had to replace flying all over the world, so I’ve created space where I can work on fashion, my artwork and my music — a multipurpose studio that I’ve come to love. It’s a beautiful mess, a sort of open space that reflects the cross-disciplinary aspects of my practice. We owe a complete restructuring and rethinking of our assumptions. In the past, hiring was based on accreditation: If you went to this or that school, or came from this or that background, we could give you a position. Now we need now to open our doors to a generation that is newly empowered, that comes with social media tools, with concepts, ideas and diverse opinions, not just accreditation and ambition. It’s a different world from the one I’ve experienced. The turbulence of the past year has put things — systemic racism, unconscious bias — on our front step, not in our backyard. I don’t think so. If you are measuring the success of something by a line, that’s a misstep. The line is a side effect of my practice, not the point. The point is to make something that is worthy of existing. I’m not the type to sit on a couch and watch a film. I’m passionate now about my label, Off-White. More than a purely fashion label, it’s a generational platform for highlighting and sharing stories.

On the positive side, there is time for the family and the things that we care about. We have family meals and talks where our sons, Jack and Will, can communicate their concerns and fears. We celebrated the New Year with my family. In the beginning there was the fear. Every package, every envelope that arrived, every trip to the store with masks and gloves — all these things were so disturbing. Even now when I walk in my neighborhood, I see so many stores for rent. So much is empty. It’s heartbreaking. I’m not comfortable being outside or being with more than a few people. I’ve been careful. I follow the rules; I wear a mask. But then I’ve always followed the rules. I was never the girl who dyed her hair pink. I’ve never worn black nail polish. Entertaining to me has always been partly about taking time for yourself. When I do invite guests, I have no more than 10 people, close family and friends. We have lot of dinners in our kitchen. Things are more casual, and they’re multigenerational. I’ve learned to cook. I learned from   how to make a roast chicken, and now I make that for my boys. This pause has helped me look at different ways of being creative. I’m following travel accounts on Instagram and walking constantly. I walk alone. It’s the one thing that allows me an escape. Some of my best ideas come from those walks. I’ve found I’m a New Yorker at heart.

Should I Be Taking Zinc?,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/style/self-care/what-is-zinc.html,"Zinc is the second most common trace mineral in our bodies and affects all organs and cells. It is a micronutrient needed for metabolism, our sense of taste and smell and especially key during times of rapid growth, such as pregnancy, infancy, childhood, and puberty. Zinc deficiency is associated with impaired growth, slower wound healing and increased susceptibility to infections like the common cold. “It’s very clear: If you are zinc deficient, your immune system will not function as well,” said Dr. David Hafler, professor of neurology and immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine. Zinc’s importance wasn’t always so clear. In the 1960s, a hematologist named Dr. Ananda S. Prasad suspected that low levels of zinc hampered growth in humans. But when it came time for him to test his hypothesis by administering zinc to his growth-stunted patients in Egypt, he couldn’t find it anywhere. So he had capsules made from bottles of zinc sulfate, and then gave them to these young adults with dwarfism. “I couldn’t believe that an 19-year-old guy could gain over six inches in height  said Dr. Prasad, of Wayne State University who stressed that this was specific to nutritionally deficient populations. Though his findings were controversial at the time, his work helped lead the National Academy of Sciences in 1974 to declare zinc an essential element. Today, sales of zinc supplement, in response to the pandemic, are projected to hit an estimated $134 million, according to Nutrition Business Journal.  As a disclaimer: Nutritional research is often flawed. It’s very unclear how a particular supplement or nutrient can directly affect our health. Why? Since we eat lots of different things, it’s difficult to determine cause and effect, or even influence, of a particular nutrient. So, reader, please approach what follows in that context. There is absolutely no definitive evidence at this time that zinc can help with coronavirus. Once again: “There is no scientific evidence that zinc or any vitamin or mineral or other dietary supplement can prevent or cure Covid-19,” said Carol Haggans, registered dietitian and consultant to the National Institutes of Health’s Office of Dietary Supplements. The Food and Drug Administration has sent warning letters to five companies touting zinc products for the prevention, and treatment of the virus. The World Health Organization said that more research is needed. It might. Zinc lozenges may shorten a cold by about 33 percent, according to a   of seven placebo-controlled clinical trials. That’s about two days for a cold that would last a week without treatment. But don’t wait until your nose has turned red to begin. If you would like to take zinc, do so within 24 hours of a cold’s onset — at first sniffle or cough. Though the proper dose has not been determined, the meta-analysis found a possible benefit when sucking on one lozenge every two hours while awake for a total of 75 milligrams or more daily. Most of the research in this area has been done on lozenges, which are slowly released over a long period of time in the mouth. It is unclear whether pills and other forms of zinc that are swallowed may have the same benefit. When pharmacist George Eby’s 3-year-old was undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia, he gave her zinc to boost her concentration of the mineral. At the time, she also happened to have a cold. Since she couldn’t swallow, she let it dissolve slowly in her mouth.  After her cold subsided, Dr. Eby worked with two other researchers and conducted the first randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial on the topic, which sparked a field of research that has had inconsistent results. The study only had 65 people.  While another   in the Canadian Medical Association Journal also found a benefit of zinc supplementation, a number of other studies have not, including a new clinical trial. Zulfiqar Bhutta, director of the Aga Khan University Institute for Global Health and Development, said the studies have been small, and narrow in focus. To gauge zinc’s effectiveness on the common cold, he said we need larger, placebo-controlled trials across geographies, in populations both zinc deficient and not. Zinc has been used topically to heal wounds since antiquity. The   recommends that children with acute diarrhea take 20 milligrams of zinc for up to two weeks (10 milligrams for infants under six months). Some previous indications of zinc’s benefit are not being confirmed in more recent studies. Beyond the gastrointestinal infections, Dr. Bhutta said his   with children who were micronutrient deficient did not find that zinc supplements significantly affected stunting, wasting and mortality. “We are also beginning to realize that many deficient populations have multiple micronutrient deficiencies and hence replacing just one nutrient doesn’t make sense, nor gives much benefits,” said Dr. Bhutta. He is the senior author of a   that indicated zinc can help reduce both the prevalence and incidence of pneumonia among young children, many with underlying conditions such as H.I.V. infections. But he said recent data, not yet published, doesn’t bear that out in general populations. Probably. Most Americans are not zinc deficient. Only about 15 percent of Americans are not getting enough zinc, according to an   of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The number is higher in some   where a large portion of the population is malnourished. But the true percentage of those with insufficient levels may be difficult to determine. Zinc is distributed throughout our body, making it hard to measure in a laboratory test. “You have to be pretty deficient to see a change in blood levels of zinc,” said Emily Ho, a nutrition scientist and director of the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University. The   of elemental zinc is 8 to 11 milligrams for most adults. Registered dietitians say it’s important to get your nutrients from your food first. Then speak with your health care provider about whether or not supplementing is necessary. Oysters are zinc powerhouses, packing the most per serving. Crab, lobster, poultry, nuts and seeds are rich in the mineral. Some cereals and beans and legumes have zinc, but also contain phytates, which are compounds found in plants or plant-based foods that may prevent zinc and iron absorption. Vegetarians tend to be more deficient, as well as older people, those with alcohol dependency, digestive disorders and sickle cell disease. The upper limit for adults is 40 milligrams per day. “It’s really important to have but you can get too much of a good thing,” said Dr. Ho. High amounts of oral zinc for a long period of time can lead to a deficiency in copper, another mineral crucial to your body in small amounts.   have shown the potential consequences of this decline in copper, though reversible: anemia and a lowered white blood cell count. Adverse effects of taking zinc include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, headaches and abdominal cramps. Can you take more if you’re sick, though? “The answer is, yes, for the short term,” said Cathi Dennehy, a pharmacist and professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of California, San Francisco. By short-term, she means seven to ten days — the average length of a cold, said Dr. Dennehy. Also, be aware that zinc can interact with prescription drugs. “Yes, when taken with some drugs, zinc can form complexes with the drug, reducing its effect,” said Dr. Dennehy. “This is why we separate dosing of these minerals — zinc supplements, calcium supplements — from drugs by 2 hours.” The Food and Drug Administration warned consumers to stop using intranasal zinc products after many complained of losing their sense of smell. The product was subsequently recalled and reformulated without zinc. To protect yourself from coronavirus, wear a mask, wash your hands and maintain distance from other people. For a common cold, doctors say support your immune system with a well-balanced diet, exercise, a good night’s sleep and take care of your mental health needs. “There’s no question that zinc is important,” said Dr. Hafler. “But once you have the minimal amount of zinc, there’s no evidence that adding more boosts the immune system.”"
,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/style/generation-z-millennials-work-life-balance.html,"When Ariel Coleman, 28, quit her last job, as a project manager in the corporate office of a bank, it wasn’t because her new employer offered her a raise, a different role or more seniority. “The work-life balance is just much better,” she said. At her new company, Omfgco, a branding and design firm in Portland, Ore., everyone works from home on Tuesdays and Thursdays at whichever hours they choose. Ms. Coleman can go for a run or walk her dog.  At the bank, she said, people judged her for taking all her paid time off. At Omfgco, it’s encouraged, which is why she didn’t mind answering work emails while sitting by the fire on a recent camping trip.  “It’s: Get your work done, but don’t worry about when those hours are,” Ms. Coleman said. “A client calls me at 8 o’clock at night and I’m happy to talk to them, because that means the next day at 10 a.m., I can take my dog to the vet. It enables me to make my career more seamless with my life. It makes it feel more like people are human.” Many of her friends have chosen their jobs for similar reasons, she said. “That’s how millennials and Gen Z-ers are playing the game — it’s not about jumping up titles, but moving into better work environments,” she said. “They’re like silent fighters, rewriting policy under the nose of the boomers.”  For many Americans, work has become  , and long hours and   something to aspire to. It has caused  ,   and  , as people struggle to find time for children or passions or pets or any sort of life besides what they do for a paycheck.  But increasingly, younger workers are pushing back. More of them expect and demand flexibility — paid leave for a new baby, say, and generous vacation time, along with daily things, like the ability to work remotely, come in late or leave early, or make time for exercise or meditation. The rest of their lives happens on their phones, not tied to a certain place or time — why should work be any different? T oday’s young workers have been called lazy and entitled. Could they, instead, be among the first to understand the proper role of work in life — and end up remaking work for everyone else?  It’s still rare for companies to operate this way, and the obstacles are bigger than any one company’s H.R. policies. Some older employees may think new hires should suffer the way they did, and   from having always-on workers. Even those that are offering more flexibility might be   and they’re competing for workers, which could change if there is an economic downturn.  Also, it’s a luxury to be able to demand flexibility in the first place. Those who can tend to have college degrees and white-collar careers, and can afford to take a pay cut in exchange, or be highly selective about their jobs.  That’s a kind of freedom that   of the economy   — and often, it’s given to highly regarded employees on a one-off basis, but not to everyone at a firm.  Still, there are signs that things could change for more workers.  Some large and influential companies, including Walmart and Apple,  have recently   to shift from prioritizing shareholders above all else to taking care of their employees too. And as more millennials become bosses and more job seekers demand a saner way to work, companies will have no choice.  “They have proven the model that you don’t need to be in the office 9 to 5 to be effective,” said Ana Recio, the executive vice president of global recruiting at Salesforce, the tech company. “This generation is single-handedly paving the way for the entire work force to do their jobs remotely and flexibly.”  , an accounting and consulting firm, found that for millennials, work is a thing, not a place.  Flexibility no longer means what it did to older generations — the ability to work from home when a plumber is coming or a child is sick. But it’s also not about 21st-century perks like free meals, on-site dry cleaning and Wi-Fi-equipped shuttles that help keep people at work longer.  Instead, it’s about employees   in ways that fit with their daily lives. That could mean working remotely or shifting hours when needed. More companies are  offering sabbaticals ; free plane tickets for vacations; meditation rooms; exercise or therapy breaks; paid time off to volunteer; and extended paid family leave.  One firm has an employee who works mostly from places like Hawaii and Costa Rica.  At another, someone worked remotely while living out of a van for three months, skiing in the mornings and working in the afternoons.  One person goes to the office at midnight so he can surf in the morning, and another takes Fridays off to backpack. “They’re maybe not on the partner track, but they’re not being penalized,” said Abby Engers, a strategist at Boly:Welch, an employment search firm in Portland, Ore. “People are burnt out. They’re making a commitment to themselves to take time off. If they see you’re doing the work and doing it well, it doesn’t matter if you’re doing it at 10 p.m. or 10 a.m.”  And it’s no longer just mothers of young children who are  . Women get   when that happens — social scientists call it   — and their careers   in terms of pay or promotions. But if more fathers and people who aren’t parents ask for flexibility, the  .  Jonathan Wong, 36, worked 80-hour weeks in management consulting when he became a father. His son would cry every time he saw his roller bag packed for another work trip, he said, and it was hard to take a break even to FaceTime his son before bedtime. So he moved to a job at RAND Corporation, the nonprofit policy research group — and took a 30 percent pay cut.  “I can bring my kid to preschool every morning,” he said. “If the overwork problem will ever be solved, guys need to be part of the solution.”  Some employers aren’t comfortable giving people autonomy over where and when they work.  “When younger workers talk about balance, what they are saying is, ‘I will work hard for you, but I also need a life,’” said Cali Williams Yost, the chief executive and founder of Flex Strategy Group, which helps organizations build flexible work cultures. “Unfortunately, what leaders hear is, ‘I want to work less.’”  But employees say that when they’re not forced to cleave life from work, they work more, and more efficiently. Melanie Neiman, 28, is a project manager at Breather, a work  space rental company . Unlike at her former, more traditional job, she comes in later in the morning because she is more productive that way, and visits her family more often because she can work from where they live.  “When I’m on vacation, if my Slack pings on my phone, I’ll probably answer it, so maybe I work more,” she said. Yet she is happy to answer messages when traveling, she said, because it’s on her terms .  “I would never answer emails at my old job on vacation.”   Social scientists have found that not all young people are asking for these benefits, even if they want them, because they fear they will be perceived as lazy or disloyal. Even when they aspire to more balanced lives,   that traditional workplaces won’t enable it.  But dozens of consulting and research   that have   young people   that for them, flexibility is a job requirement.  When   which work arrangement would be most helpful to people, young people were more likely than older people to say the flexibility to choose when they worked. Of people 18 to 29, men were more likely than women to say it, and people without children at home were as likely as parents to say it.  In a survey of 11,000 workers and 6,500 business leaders by Harvard Business School and Boston Consulting Group,   that among the new developments most urgently affecting their businesses were employees’ expectations for flexible, autonomous work; better work-life balance; and remote working. (Just 30 percent, though, said their businesses were prepared.)  Technology is a big reason for the change. The youngest people entering the work force don’t remember a time when people weren’t  always  reachable , so they don’t see why they would need to sit in an office to work. (They also say they are more practiced than older colleagues at setting boundaries  on how  much they use their phones, so it doesn’t become overbearing.)  Another reason young people are asking for more flexibility is that they’re marrying and having children later, so they’re more invested in their careers by the time they do, and have more leverage to ask for what they need. Many are caring for aging parents too.  Ali Levitan,  39,  worked at a large media firm when she had her first child and decided to look for a new job. She wanted flexibility, but also to stay on her “extremely ambitious” career path.  It was unwise to mention children in job interviews, she had been told. But once she had a job offer at General Assembly, an education company, she asked if she would be able to work from home most Fridays and pick up her child from school. They immediately agreed.  “I almost fell over at the response because that was not what I had experienced or expected,” Ms. Levitan said.  Demanding that employers treat employees well is part of the value system of the youngest generation of workers, which is the  , researchers and recruiters say.  “Gen Z is so socially aware and so progressive, they’re asking for things that older generations have been scared to ask for,” Ms. Recio at Salesforce said.   Many have also seen their parents struggle with inflexible employers or unstable jobs. Millennials were the   who entered professions in big numbers. Many young adults saw their parents lose jobs and savings during the Great Recession. They no longer expect a lifetime of loyalty from an employer, so some say they don’t want to give their whole life to work.  “They’ve watched what’s happened to the generations before them and they see the problems that might come ahead,” said Kathleen Gerson, a sociologist at New York University whose recent research on the topic will be  published  this month by the  . “As the work force becomes more diverse, men as well as women are saying there’s more to life than work, and we want a satisfying life as well.”   to work long, inflexible hours, yet many either work them anyway or   without asking for permission,  .  But more young people, recruiters say, are asking for flexibility upfront, and some prioritize it over pay or seniority. Recruiters who visit college campuses say new graduates no longer see it as something to negotiate for, said Marcee Harris Schwartz, the national director of diversity and inclusion at BDO, the accounting firm: “It’s just assumed it’s part of the deal.”  “Years ago, the interview was, for lack of a better word, a test,” said Kamaj Bailey, who works in recruiting at Con Edison, the power company. “Now it’s a conversation. Yes, I want to show that I’m a good candidate, but I’m also seeing if I’m going to get what I expect.”  John Paul Graff, 34, is a pathologist, as was his father, who worked in private practice at least 12 hours a day. Dr. Graff decided to work in academic medicine, and the No. 1 reason was for work-life balance. He estimated that he gave up about $100,000 a year but said it’s worth it to work 40 hours a week.  “What we settled on was that the most important thing was time,” Dr. Graff said. “Money will come, it will go, but you’re only given so much time.”  A  , which helps companies add flexibility strategies, found that older employees are just as likely as younger people to want flexibility. They’re less likely to have it, though, because they’re less likely to ask for it. Sometimes, tensions flare between young people who demand a life outside work and deskbound older workers.  “As boomers age, they too are looking for more workplace flexibility, but they seem to begrudge giving the same to younger workers when they didn’t have it themselves at their ages and life stage,” said Pamela Stone, a sociologist at Hunter College.  Ms. Coleman, who works at the design firm in Portland, said it comes down to this: The members of her generation are unwilling to settle for the way things have always been done. It’s especially true of the women, she said, and she is hopeful that men will continue to join them.  “We are just fed up and fired up about asking for what we need,” she said. “We’re changing the rules. We’re the ones tasked with: Let’s change the system so we can all succeed.”"
"What Do Gen Z Shoppers Want? A Cute, Cheap Outfit That Looks Great on Instagram",style,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/style/fast-fashion-gen-z.html,"For every   and school-skipping climate change protester, there is another member of   buying inexpensive clothes on a smartphone.  Their purchasing choices — fueled by   and catered to by a new wave of ultra-fast-fashion retailers such as  , Pretty Little Thing and Missguided (responsible for a  ) — are as much about how an outfit will look on social media as in the real world.  Three Gen Z shoppers in America, Australia and Britain invited us into their homes to talk about what they buy, and why. All of them work after school or save money to pay for their own purchases. Mia Grantham is a 16-year-old British high school student studying for her A-levels. She lives with her father and her younger sister, Annie, in Wilmslow, England, a town outside Manchester. Her bedroom is small but immaculately kept, with a bulb-lit dressing table and a pillow shaped like a speech bubble reading “You’ve Got This” on her bed.  Mia’s interest in clothes ramped up about 18 months ago, when she started getting an allowance and attracting followers on her social media accounts. She has more than 1,500 followers on Instagram, gets around 500 views per story on Snapchat and spends three hours per day on her iPhone XR (about five hours on weekends and during vacation).  Her favorite going-out look is a red dress. She owns 14 of them. I browse every single day — at least once — on the Pretty Little Thing phone app. It’s my favorite, and I don’t look anywhere else, except if I see something on an Instagram influencer I like. My current favorite is Molly-Mae Hague, a star from the 2019 series of “  She recently created an exclusive clothing range for PLT, which makes me like the brand even more. Normally I look at shopping apps at the end of the day before bed for about 10 to 15 minutes. But if there is an event coming up that I want a new outfit for, then I could browse for more than an hour. I don’t really go to bricks-and-mortar stores. If I do, I go to Primark. Sometimes  . Maybe once a month, probably less. It could literally just be a meal. Or a house party, or a friend’s birthday. It could also be school, where we have a dress code but not a uniform. I pay £8.99 as part of a yearly subscription, which gives me unlimited next-day delivery on anything I buy. I know all the delivery people really well now — they always know when I have plans on a Friday or Saturday night. I don’t buy from places like Boohoo.com or Missguided as I’d have to pay for delivery, which would be a waste of money. I buy something at least once a week, and my basket value can be anywhere from £5.99 up. Once it was £230. Last week I bought 11 items and sent back three. Seventy percent of the time I send some ordered items back. Eighty? One hundred? Those are pieces I’ve kept. The ones I probably wear the most are gray leggings that cost £2.50. For going out, I bought a silky red dress with a cutout for a house party. It cost £12.50 from the PLT Shape collection, which is for people like me who have an hourglass figure. I’ve worn it out three times, which is a lot for me. Normally I just wear a dress once. Because I’ll normally be in photos when I’m wearing it that are then posted on social media. I wouldn’t really want someone seeing me in a dress more than once. People might think I didn’t have style if I wore the same thing over and over. Style is about changing for whatever the situation you are in and for different events. Well, things like leggings that you just wear in private around the house you can keep for years. Dresses, when you’ve worn them: twice. Of course. If I’m only going to wear something once or twice, I’m going to want to buy the cheapest possible. Social media is a big consideration. I’m on Snapchat and Instagram, and occasionally Facebook. I take selfies for social media every single time I go out, first in my bedroom and post them online, and then always with friends or my boyfriend, Will, when I’m at the party. More people will see an outfit online than they probably will in real life. I’m on Snapchat the most because of its messenger function, then Instagram, where I have both a public and a private account and spend an hour per day. For IRL, if I see an item I like, normally I’ll   before I buy it so I can see what a real person rather than a model looks like in it. People buy and sell fashion so quickly, I can usually find even the newest things on there. Most of my friends do that too. An Oh Polly! dress. I buy them for about £20 from Depop, though new they cost about £40 to £60. Those dresses I keep — I have three of them. Teenagers don’t mind buying secondhand clothes like some older people do: You can get good looks at a cheaper price, or directly swap one dress for another online. I tend to sell lots of the clothes I don’t want in big batches on Depop. It gives me the money to buy new things. I also sometimes take big bags to consignment stores in town, where they give you a bit of money for your clothes depending on how much you bring in. No. Yes. I’ve noticed quite a few are made in England, which shocked me. I thought they’d all be made in countries like China, India and Bangladesh. Also, we have been learning a bit in Sociology about how our clothes are made and the working conditions for people who make them. In some countries I know they don’t get very good wages. It’s part of globalization. I wouldn’t talk about it with my friends casually, but we do talk about it in the classroom. It came on my radar three months ago, I’d say. I am hearing more and more about it because a lot of brands are now bringing out sustainable fashion capsule collections, where clothes are made out of recycled materials, for example. A lot look the same as the normal collection but cost a few pounds more. But if I’m honest, I do think: Why would I pay more, when I can get the same for less? Andrea Vargas, an 18-year-old freshman at Hofstra University, loves hunting for sales. She looks for them on websites like   and  , as well as physical stores like H&M and Forever 21, where she can flip through the racks and, occasionally, find gems. “I go shopping when the season sales are on,” she said one Saturday night at her family’s home in Farmingdale, N.Y. She commutes to school and spends most weekend nights out with friends: getting dinner, maybe going to a party or a concert. Her plan for this particular evening was to go to P.F. Chang’s with three girlfriends.  Her room is small, with wood floors and inspirational quotes in photo frames on her pale yellow walls. A Billie Eilish poster hangs opposite her bed. A guitar she made out of an old skateboard sits in a corner. Scanning the clothes in her room, she began talking about how she got them. “The back-to-school sales, the fall sales, the summer sales,” she said. “I love sales.” Her absolute favorite piece of clothing is a red plush jacket from Forever 21. She wears it relentlessly when the weather is right. “It’s just so cute,” Ms. Vargas said. “I feel like it dresses up an outfit.” Ms. Vargas pays for her clothes herself, using money she earns by working at Target. The red jacket cost her around $40, and she said it was worth every penny. But, she said, “I feel like there’s no point in spending $40 on a T-shirt. I personally feel like if the quality of the shirt doesn’t match the price, it doesn’t make sense for me to buy it. If a jean jacket costs $60 and I can find it for $20, I’m going to buy it for $20. Especially since I’m in college, I need to buy all these books.” Ms. Vargas guessed she had purchased between 100 and 200 items this year, including shoes and jewelry, and that her wardrobe comprises 500 or 600 total pieces. “I would say the majority of it is shirts,” she said. “They have to be graphic tees. I like a little quote on my shirt here and there. I have yet to buy new jeans. I like a lot of ripped jeans. I rarely buy shoes.” She doesn’t generally check where her clothing is made, and she doesn’t feel guilty about how much of it she has. After she’s done wearing something, it can have a second life. “My mom is from El Salvador and my dad is from Nicaragua,” she said. “They’re not wealthy countries, so I like to give back to people who don’t have a lot. It’s hot there, so I can’t send long sleeves, but I try to send shorts that don’t fit me, things that are still presentable and wearable.” She thinks the right amount of money to spend on clothes is $10 to $15 on tops, and $20-$40 on bottoms. For dresses, which are usually for a special occasion, she’ll go over $40. She estimates she wears each piece 15 times before ultimately donating it or selling it on Depop — but she also doesn’t want to be seen wearing the same thing every day on Instagram. “If I have a shirt in one of my previous pictures I try not to take a picture again in it,” she said. “I don’t like to repeat.” Ms. Vargas had invited her friends over to get ready. Alana Wilson, 18, said that Instagram plays a big role in her shopping life, too. The moon-and-stars earrings that sparkled beneath her hair were purchased off an Instagram ad. Almost all of her clothes are from Fashion Nova. “If it’s cute, it’s from Fashion Nova,” Ms. Wilson said. “Any time I have money I’ll do a whole spree on Fashion Nova. I like it because a lot of IG models have it.” Another friend, Sofia Barbetta, also 18, agreed. “I feel like I find most clothes I want to buy in Instagram ads,” she said. “I don’t even follow that many fashion pages, but I see an ad and I’m like, ‘That’s really cute.’” She unlocked her phone to show some outfits she’d posted on  , a photo-sharing app. “I went through a camo pants phase,” she said of one look. “This outfit, I got inspiration from Twitter.” Ms. Barbetta said she’d gotten very into Twitter lately. She started a Post Malone stan account several years ago, but lately it had become a place to post personal things. An hour after Ms. Vargas began getting ready with her friends, she zipped herself into her outfit for the night: a pair of black platform military-style boots from Target, black and white houndstooth pants, and a black off-the-shoulder top from H&M. “I got this outfit yesterday,” she said. “I was like, ‘This is the outfit I’m going to wear.’” But first, her hair. Ms. Vargas propped her iPhone up in front of her and sat cross-legged in front of her mirror. She pulled Miss Jessie’s Jelly Soft Curls styler through her waves. “I wanted to get one of those vlogging cameras,” she said, “one of the Nikon ones.” For now, she uses her iPhone. Hours later she used it to Instagram a photo of her and her friends posing outside a restaurant in 50 degree weather. They had decided not to go to P.F. Chang’s after all, and were at Taste of Asia instead. None of them were wearing coats. “Trust me we were freezing,” she declared in the caption. But they were all smiling. Nicole Lambert, 20, lives in Sydney, Australia, with her parents and is studying for an undergraduate degree in public relations and advertising at the University of New South Wales. She tutors students on weekdays and works a retail job on weekends.  When she has time off, she and her friends like to dress up and hit the festival circuit. On a recent evening, after spending the previous day dancing to EDM, she and her friend Helena Marshall got ready in her bedroom for a more relaxing dinner. When I’m dressing to go out, I’m dressing to be seen, which is weird to say because we’re not influencers. It sounds shallow, but I think in the back of your head you’re like: I probably should avoid wearing the same outfit twice. At the end of the day, I prioritize the look versus the practicality. And that’s so unbelievable. My friend yesterday at this festival had a really cute Tiger Mist top with hearts all over it, but it had off-the-shoulder sleeves. I felt so bad for her the whole day, because she couldn’t put her arms up. But she got cute photos, so it was fine.  I know when you put something up on Instagram and it does well, you’re like, “Well, that was a good choice on my behalf.” I love it when people message, “Where did you get that from?” You know you’ve found something people can’t easily find. I think about what I’m going to post for a decent amount of time. It’s a very curated version of your life. You want to look good in your photo, but have a funny caption so people know you’re down to earth and relatable. That’s why we have private Instagrams, because it gets tiring. That’s where we feel fully free to post whatever. The tragedies of your life. The real me. On my main Instagram, people wouldn’t know I’m funny. Because I just overthink what I post: Will people get it? Are people actually going to laugh at that? Sometimes I’ll get a weird feeling where I need to get off social media. I know some people delete their Instagram, like just the app. But that’s admitting to yourself that you have a problem. I look for clothes at least once a week usually — either for an occasion, or just as something to do either online or in store. I shop 60 percent online, 40 percent in person. But 75 percent of the time, I’ll go to the shops, have a look around, and not find one thing because I think everything is the same. I’m not afraid to put on something weird. I’m really big into animal print at the moment. Almost to the point where I’ll wear too much of it. I love my snake pants — and flares. Flares should never go out. For basics, 100 percent of my wardrobe is from Kookai. They’re always rotating really nice, classic things. I get a lot of stuff off Revolve, because there are so many different brands. You’ve got things there that you’re not going to see five people wearing once you’re out. From other online brands like Princess Polly, Tiger Mist. Sometimes it’s overwhelming how much stuff there is online. I could go on for hours. Often, on Instagram, I’ll scroll through the Explore page, and people just tagging outfits. It’s so helpful because you just click onto the account, find the item. That’s how I find the little niche things. If I feel so amazing in something, I’m probably not going to look too hard into the price. But I don’t like investing a lot of money for something you might not wear too much. I like Pretty Little Thing for crazy things for cheap, because they just do interesting little tops or little dresses, clubbing clothes. Do I look at the labels of clothes? Not really. In the back of my head, I assume that I know where the clothes are made: in China. In terms of how much I would spend: average price of a dress, probably about $180 Australian dollars. Jeans, about $150. A good going out top, $50. I do like a nice pair of heels, so I’ve spent like $200 for a pair. But then again I’ve got ones for $50. In my wardrobe now, I’d say I have roughly 200 pieces. I do a big spring clean every year and send boxes of clothes over to my family in the Philippines. One of my cousins has a market stall. So I assumed that maybe my stuff would end up there if they didn’t want to keep it for themselves. I would say 30 percent of my wardrobe would get pulled out. Maybe 80 bits of clothes. It makes a good dent. When I pull it all out and you see a big pile of clothes on your floor, you feel a bit sick. I’m glad that I can send it somewhere and it’s helping at least my family. I want to support sustainable brands. But if it doesn’t work for me and what I’m doing in my lifestyle, I’m going to go with something else instead. Timing is important. For what I wore to the Listen Out festival yesterday, I ordered on Tuesday morning, it came on Wednesday morning: literally in 24 hours. That means so much to me. I’m the least decisive person and the least patient person. When miniature bags were in, I was obsessed with this one from London. You could get your initials on it. But it said it could take 30 days and I was like, never mind. I got a cute one from Mango. You’re pushing it after seven business days. If it’s a big order I don’t mind waiting for a week. But if it’s one thing, it’s like: Why?"
Is Air a Scam?,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/05/style/self-care/how-to-clean-air-filter.html,"People living in Western states just suffered one of the most prolonged periods of poor air in recent history. So, like in California these last few months, “bad air” can mean pollution from wildfire smoke. But it can also mean high quantities of mold, pollen, ozone or organic compounds that form inside our homes as byproducts of cooking, cleaning or building materials.  The science of indoor air is just starting to be probed by large-scale studies. The average American lives to 79 years of age and 69 of those years are indoor. As an indoor species, we should try to breathe the best air possible inside. Probably. There is a   looking at air filtration, and the good news is that the technology works to drastically improve indoor air quality. If you’re able to  , look for a HEPA air purifier that will grab more than 99.97 percent of tiny 0.3 micron particles in the air.  These purifiers work by forcing air through a tiny mesh that captures smoke, allergens and pollen, but make sure to check the square footage coverage on the product. Buying a purifier that cleans a 200-square-foot space and putting it in a 400-square-foot room won’t give you good results, said  , an environmental health researcher at the University of California at Davis School of Medicine.  If you live in an area with chronically poor air quality because of pollution, it’s probably a good idea to invest in a purifier. Another evidence-based method of cleaning air is to filter house air through an HVAC system set to recirculate. Smoke and other particulates will get sucked into the house filter and pushed through the system.  Just make sure those are clean and have a high Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value — often called the MERV rating. The rating shows a filter’s ability to capture larger particles between 0.3 and 10 microns, so a higher rating means the system can grab a larger share of particles. If an off-the-shelf air purifier is out of your budget and your house doesn’t have an HVAC system, you can make your own air purifier for about $30 by taping a square furnace filter (again, with a MERV rating of 12 or higher) to the front or back of a box fan.  Just like a commercial air purifier, the fan sucks air through the filter, and pushes out clean air on the other side.   of these D.I.Y. systems showed that they removed about 80 percent of the pollution particles from a room.  They work best for short windows of time, say when a massive smoke plume moves in and parks over a city for a week. In the long run, the fan’s motor is likely to overheat or clunk out. In order for these systems to work, they are likely to be noisy, the experts say. It’s the same idea as a range hood over your stove (which you should also use when cooking, to cut down on compounds flying into the air you’re breathing): Noise is annoying, but it matters because it means that air is being moved around. Your indoor air risk depends on the outdoor air quality, which can be monitored with apps, how much flow there is between indoor and outdoor (newer, energy-efficient houses tend to have very little air circulation with the outdoors), and the activities that happen inside your home.  Consider cooking, which creates a lot of compounds, especially when using a gas stove, as well as cleaning. Experts suggest opening windows to flush out cleaning products as producers of compounds that you may not want to be breathing in. No. The idea is that increasing the humidity of a room with poor air quality will encourage particles to drop out of the sky and fall down like rain, but that’s not how the physics works, said  , an environmental engineer at the University of California at Davis. In fact, it can have an irritating effect. “In general, wildfire smoke particles don’t like water very much so they’re not going to grow effectively unless you make your house into a cloud — and that’s not going to happen,” Dr. Cappa said.  Ultrafine particles, which can enter your bloodstream and even your brain, are going to hang out in the air unless pushed or sucked away, so humidity won’t change their location. “Even if you grow them by making it more humid, it might actually make them stay in the air longer,” he said. Not on any meaningful scale. There have been studies that looked at how plants decrease so-called V.O.C.s (volatile organic compounds) in the air, but those studies were done in very controlled conditions — not in homes that have complex air environments.  According to an analysis of 196 plant experiments published last year in the  , you’d need 10 to 1,000 plants per square meter of a building in order to achieve the same air exchange that most buildings already have with outdoor air. “I like plants — plants feel good,” said Richard Corsi, an air quality researcher at Portland State University. “But to physically measure a change in air quality, you essentially would be living in a jungle. And you’d have other problems with humidity and mold.” Plants simply are too passive to make a meaningful difference in air quality, Dr. Cappa said. “One of the things to think about with filters or moving air around: You’re really doing something active to move the air around to move it through,” he said. “If you don’t have anything actively moving around, it’s going to take quite a while to change anything.” No, and they actually do the opposite. So-called clean-burning candles will emit more compounds into the air. The problem is the flame, Dr. Corsi said. The wax and scenting agents get heated up but they only burn for a millisecond, so there’s no chance for complete combustion because the time is so short.  “You start to combust things but you don’t finish combusting them, so you get all these strange intermediate compounds from scenting agents,” Dr. Corsi said. Some of those can be toxic or irritating. For essential oils, the problem is similar: They are emitting compounds into the air that can react with the complex existing air chemistry to create irritating offshoots.  “There is no evidence that suggests that the oils improve air quality,” said  , an air quality engineer and researcher at the Florida Solar Energy Center, part of the University of Central Florida. “Other pollutants, like ozone, which comes from outside to inside, can react with V.O.C.s to create secondary pollutants which are harmful.” No. Negative ion filters are sometimes compared with HEPA air filters, but they’re not very effective. They work by shooting negative ions into the air, which causes particles to stick to your walls or floor, taking them out of the air. They do emit ozone, and many people associate ozone as a clean smell — it’s the smell you get after a lightning storm. The problem is that ozone is an irritant, and negative ion filters have a low flow rate; they don’t move the air around enough to make a difference (back to: noisy is better). A couple of studies have found that most ion generators created a lot of ions — hooray! — but had no noticeable effect on pollen, mold or bacterial counts beyond reductions that an air-conditioner provided. Another version of negative ions that is even more passive is a Himalayan salt lamp. They are “natural ionizers,” but there is no evidence that they work to improve air quality."
Tiny Love Stories: ‘Mami Sent Me to Check You Out’,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/style/tiny-modern-love-stories-mami-sent-me-to-check-you-out.html,"As a dutiful girlfriend, I accompanied Arturo to J.F.K. Airport to pick up his sister, who was arriving from Buenos Aires. Greeting her, I casually asked what brought her to New York. “Mami sent me to check you out,” she said. Years later, Mami was visiting us. She offered to buy me a replacement diamond for the one that fell out of my engagement ring. “Oh, I can’t allow you to buy me something so expensive,” I said. Her reply? “Please do, because you are everything I hoped for in a wife for my son.” How could I refuse? —  In February 2019, my youngest sister, Melina, admitted herself into the hospital for PTSD from childhood trauma. When she returned home, she texted, “Do not contact me ever again!” Determined to get through to her, I invited her to walk with me and Preston, my goldendoodle. She loved Preston but refused. In March, Melina died of suicide. On a walk the morning after her funeral, Preston suddenly turned and barked behind us. Nothing was in sight. I felt then that Melina had changed her mind and decided, after all, to join us. —  I spoke to Sun Ung in broken Chinese, excited hand gestures and hugs. We lived together for 18 years: a strong-willed Cambodian refugee and me, his spunky Texan granddaughter. Then his Alzheimer’s took hold. He would scrunch his eyebrows, searching for our history in a sea of fading memories. I started every sentence with, “Remember when — ?” But, one of our final nights together before he died last March, we sat beside each other in silence. A granddaughter without the words to convey her love. A grandfather who didn’t need to remember the past to know she loved him anyway. —  Chantal and I met in Bordeaux, France. I was an American student, with long hair and a beard, dressed like John Lennon in olive Army surplus fatigues. Chantal, whose grandfather escaped Mussolini, looked like Isabella Rossellini. We married in Oakland, Calif. Chantal did not want children; I did. We divorced. Chantal’s journey continued, wild as ever. Mine: law school, suburbs, remarriage, children and Little League. Chantal would sometimes call. She became a psychologist. Once, Chantal said she wanted a child and asked if I’d be the father. I mistakenly told my wife. Flattered, remembering, hesitating, I said no. Nice though. —  See more Tiny Love Stories at  . Submit yours at  . Want more from Modern Love?

The Dress Promised Me Something the Doctors Couldn’t,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/style/modern-love-the-dress-promised-me-something-the-doctors-couldnt.html,"The dress was black with shiny buttons at the wrists and an oversized bow in the back. I said to my friend, “I want you to bury me in this dress,” which I found funny because I thought I was dying. And then I thought it wasn’t funny at all. Even if the doctors couldn’t pin down what was going on with me, I was so alarmed by my symptoms and the doctors’ gravest guesses that I felt anxious about whether or not I would have a future. I was 27. What was certain is that I was shrinking. Rapidly, uncontrollably. It had nothing to do with me not eating and everything to do with me seemingly being eaten up. My clothes hung loose at the waist and sloughed off my shoulders as if they belonged to a stranger, so I bought a stranger’s dress. Kate Spade, $348 retail. I found it for $50 at an online designer consignment store while on hold with the hospital; a nurse was checking on the results of my bone marrow biopsy. My laptop sat in front of me, casting a bluish light across my bruised legs. Online shopping was the sort of thing one might do if she were on hold with her cable company, not awaiting a possible blood cancer diagnosis. I wedged the phone between my shoulder and ear, pulled the computer onto my lap, and started browsing. The pages teemed with runway castoffs: vintage handbags, red carpet gowns, scarves and coats by designers whose names I didn’t recognize and couldn’t pronounce. I filled my cart with a cobalt dress, a blush silk blouse, a slinky skirt. On paper, the doctors said, it looked like it could be lymphoma. The symptoms were classic: fever, night sweats, weight loss. But the scans kept coming back clean. A biopsy of my enlarged lymph node showed it to be benign. Blood cancers could be sneaky, they told me. They would have to search for it, and the searching would be painful. Two weeks earlier, a doctor had taken a surgical drill to my hip and hollowed out my bones with a syringe fit for a large horse. “Painful” was a deficient descriptor. “Thanks for waiting,” said the nurse. “The doctor said there were some abnormalities with your bone marrow but no signs of malignancy, so we’ll have to keep looking.” I sat still while my insides turned over. A cold sweat crept across my face. I closed my eyes, shook my head and returned to my shopping cart. I was not going to dwell. No — I was going to shop. I was going to shop until I could think of nothing else. I punched in my credit card number and bought the Kate Spade. Then I rushed to my closet, threw open the double doors and began rifling through Target impulse buys and ill-fitting hand-me-downs, tearing every tacky print and cheap polyester blend from its hanger. I hurled the clothes into boxes and garbage bags. They smelled like the hospital, all burned coffee and antiseptic. I didn’t want them. I didn’t even want to look at them. I wanted silk. I wanted velvet. Within five minutes I had ransacked my entire closet. The carpet was hardly visible under haphazard heaps. My lungs seized up, retaliating against my quick, sudden movements. I sank against the door frame, hands pressed against my chest, and let fatigue overtake me. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t do illness anymore. I could only do this. A few weeks later, the first dress arrived. I spun around in it, watching the hem rise and fall. Something about it made me feel less like a haggard patient and more like the kind of woman who went to cocktail parties dripping with perfume and family money. The fabric, heavy and thick, felt expensive and purposeful, unlike anything I had ever owned. Over the next few months, I made it my mission to build a new wardrobe from scratch. The process demanded every moment of my free time, every spare thought. I scoured the internet for the best in secondhand glamour, pausing only when my energy gave way to fever and exhaustion. There are dozens of websites dedicated to discount high fashion: The Real Real, Saks Off 5th, Luxury Garage Sale. They sold Tom Ford, Alexander McQueen, Isabel Marant — designers whose names I had heard only on old episodes of “Project Runway.” I texted pictures of a black-and-white patterned dress to my best friend, a sensible, no-nonsense beauty from northwest Iowa who has never heard of Oscar de la Renta and doesn’t particularly care. “Do you like this?” I asked. “It’s 100 percent silk.” “How do you even wash that?” she replied. “I think it’s dry clean only,” I said, as if I had ever been to a dry cleaner. We both knew it was impractical. The clothes were expensive and high maintenance, most of them over-the-top fancy for my modest life in nonprofit communications. But they felt vital. I told myself I was overdue for some frivolity, that I deserved to treat myself. For my next doctor’s appointment, I picked out a Valentino pencil skirt that fit snugly against my new, withered body. “I just don’t know what else to do,” my doctor said. She was my age. Young, but confident in her training. Confident in the scans and labs and almost-normal test results. “Can I see you again in six weeks? We can repeat blood work then and come up with a timeline for scans. Does that sound like an OK plan?” I rubbed the pointed toe of my high heel against the linoleum. “I don’t know.” “OK,” she said. “Tell me what you’re thinking.” “Just that I live here,” I said, gesturing at my body. “I have to live here.” That night I ran my fingers through my hair, and a clump of blond strands fell loose into my palm. “It’s just stress,” I told my cat. I brushed my hands together, letting my hair fall into the trash, and returned to my shopping list. Every time a new item arrived, I would unpack it just to feel the weight and texture of the fabric against my skin. Some pieces were musty, others smelled like perfume. I liked to imagine where they had been — fund-raising galas, board meetings, socialite circles. Each one had lived a life before me. Now I held onto them in the dim light of my bedroom like tangible hope. Time passed. Bruises appeared, disappeared and reappeared on my limbs. I shrunk some more. Most days my clothes covered the shrinkage and distracted from the exhaustion. I saw other doctors: two surgeons, three oncologists, an integrative medicine physician, a reiki expert. Finally, in a move my former self would have called crazy, I enlisted the help of a sound healer. She was slight and lively, a 70-year-old in a child’s body. In her office on the day we met, she jumped from her chair and asked me to stand and extend my right arm. “I’m going to press down on you,” she said, “and I want you to resist me with equal pressure, OK?” She pushed me down, and I pushed back. My arm bounced at her sudden release. She shook her head and scowled, then grabbed a bottle of hemp oil. “Hold this!” she said, shoving the bottle into my hand and pressing down on my arm again. This time I was in sync with her, more agile, adjusting to her pressure. “Yes,” she said. “Your body likes this product. You can buy it on my website.” It was all make-believe, but I was desperate. Desperate, I told myself, but not insane — desperation and insanity were two distinct, if bordering, states. But this is where desperation takes us — the sick, the chronic, the dying, the grieving. We’re forced to find hope in what we used to mock: God, the afterlife, miracles, hemp oil. Healing, by any means. Healing, against all odds. Healing, sometimes, in the form of a designer dress. After every appointment, after every failed attempt to name my illness, I would prop myself in bed, choose new dresses and think of all the places I would wear them. I would wear the Derek Lam on a first date and the Marc Jacobs to a corporate meeting. I would carry a baby on my hip in the Burberry coat as I strolled down the street smelling the crisp fall air and believing in love and God and things to come. The clothes promised me something the doctors, as they continue to search for a diagnosis, still can’t: an uncomplicated future. And I promised a future to the clothes. This was their life after life. And they deserved that, didn’t they?  is a writer in Durham, N.C., who works in nonprofit communications. Modern Love can be reached at  .

"Tiny Love Stories: ‘Mommy, Why Don’t You Have a Boyfriend?’",style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/style/tiny-modern-love-stories-mommy-why-dont-you-have-a-boyfriend.html,"My first semester of college, I only called my mother twice. At my house, I felt generally misunderstood and judged for my weight; at school, I was finally free. But the pandemic forced me home. I spent the first months in my room. Then, my mother and I started watching Chinese competition shows together, bonding over the contestants. Now I make sure she’s eating even when she avoids meals to stay thin. We converse in simple Mandarin, a language I hadn’t bothered to learn before. I buy her flowers and cry when I think of leaving her. —  I take a lot of photos. My house is filled with images of places I have visited and people I love. I rotate the photos, taking new ones, making more prints, slipping new pictures over old ones in frames. But I have realized, six months after my partner’s sudden death, that the photos I have of John are all I will ever have. So I conjure up memories of him — hiking in the Sierras, enjoying a party, reading at the kitchen table. Love endures without fresh photos, but oh how I miss stealthily snapping him. —  Our pace slowed as Monica’s feet started to hurt in her blue velvet heels. I was wearing sneakers and offered to switch. I stumbled along, leaning most of my weight on her shoulders. We only made it one city block before switching back. This wasn’t the first or last time she would prop me up as I floundered uncomfortable in femininity. Later she would help me change my legal name and gender marker. She still loves — and can rock — high heels. But next time the night gets long, I will probably offer a piggyback ride. —  From the back seat, my 5-year-old son, Jack, said: “Mommy, why don’t you have a boyfriend?” Freshly divorced and unsure how to answer, I asked why he asked. Jack replied, “Because you’re really nice. You should be with someone nice.” I realized the troubles of my previous marriage had not gone unnoticed. Jack said I should look for someone kind, respectful and of medium height — like Grandma. Eight years later, Jack calls my husband, Greg, “Dad.” I tease Greg that it’s a good thing that he’s on the shorter side, just like my mother. —  See more Tiny Love Stories at  . Submit yours at  .

,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/style/garment-workers-around-the-world.html," Zipper operator at PT. Fajarindo Faliman Zipper, which focuses largely on in-house brands  Tangerang, Indonesia “Most of my co-workers and I are all old-timers,” said Ms. Rumsinah, who has been working at the same factory for 26 years. “It’s a good factory, so no one really quits. There’s seldom any job openings — only if someone retires.”  She is paid about 3.4 million rupiah, or $241, per month, which she said is tight as a single parent. Her son recently finished high school. “He can’t work at my factory because there’s no openings,” she said. “He wants to be a teacher, but we don’t have enough money to send him to go to university.” Though her job is tiring, “all jobs are tiring,” she said. “At least weekends are off, and the hours are not too bad.”  Sewing bedsheets and curtains at a textile mill   Pakistan Waheed, who is being identified only by his first name, has been in the textile industry for 20 years and works seven days a week to support his wife and two young sons. They share a house with his parents, his sisters and his brothers. “Most factories place a lot of restrictions on garment workers. Once they come in for their shift around 8 in the morning, there’s no knowing when supervisors will let them out. It may be 8 p.m. or 10 p.m. by the time they are allowed to leave for the day.  Workers at my factory don’t have it as bad. That’s why I’ve been here for the past 10 years. It’s a nice place to work. But some of the resources that workers really need aren’t provided, such as first-aid kits or pension cards. It’s pretty common to get your fingers injured — sometimes needles break and get stuck in your bone if your hand gets in the way of the machine. Then you have to go to the hospital and get X-rays yourself.  It’s difficult to manage on the salary I earn. My expenses amount to about 2,000 rupees a day, including the cost of my children’s clothes, their education, my family’s groceries and other bills. But I barely make 1,000 rupees a day.”  Sews outdoor apparel and bags at Horizon Outdoor   Khum Longvek, Kampong Chhnang, Cambodia Six days a week, Ms. Hong wakes up at 4:35 a.m. to catch the truck to work from her village. Her workday begins at 7 and usually lasts nine hours, with a lunch break. During the peak season, which lasts two to three months, she works until 8:30 p.m. Ms. Hong has been in the garment business for 22 years. She earns the equivalent of about $230 a month and supports her father, her sister, her brother (who is on disability) and her 12-year-old son.  She hopes he will not end up in a factory, too, but the price of a quality education — about $20 per month — is beyond her means. While she is at work, her sister manages the household, taking care of their oxen and rice farming their land for extra food.  “I feel tired, but I have no choice,” Ms. Hong said. “I have to work.”  Tracks daily production numbers at Supertex, which works with major active wear brands  Yumbo, Colombia “They spoil us a lot here,” Ms. Tascon said. “It’s a job with good stability.” Her workplace blasts music — usually salsa or something traditional — from speakers throughout the day while employees make coats, bathing suits and sportswear.  At 11 a.m., employees get “pausas activas”: active breaks with music. Makes shoes for a comfort footwear brand at PT. Dwi Naga Sakti Abadi  Tangerang, Indonesia Mr. Sarjimin has worked at the same factory for about 12 years. The job is relatively stable, and his workplace is spacious, bright and safe.  He earns the equivalent of $250 a month, and his wife also works at a factory. The family is able to send their children, a 13-year-old and a 9-year-old, to good schools. They recently purchased a computer for their older son, who is passionate about technology. Mr. Sarjimin farms catfish to supplement his family’s grocery money. He started six months ago, filling a big empty drum with starter fish as an experiment. Now he has two drums with 300 fish each, and he sells them to friends, family and neighbors.  One day, he would like to raise catfish full time. “There’s a motivational speaker I heard once, ‘You have to dare to dream, how to get there is a question for a different time,’” he said. “I like remembering those words.”  Sewing machine operator at Pinehurst Manufacturing, which works with major active wear brands San Pedro Sula, Honduras The factory where Saida has worked for the last 12 years is one of the few in the area. She earns about 8,200 lempira each month, roughly $331. “It doesn’t cover everything,” she said. “Vivimos sobregirados.” (“We live overdrawn.”) Saida lives with her mother and her 19-year-old daughter, who goes to school. “I am the one who provides everything at home. The house, the water, the electricity,” she said. “You have to stop buying certain things to be able to cover the necessities.” Her unit currently has one primary client, a major sportswear brand. This is a source of anxiety for her and her co-workers because they fear mass layoffs if the client leaves the company. “It’s really difficult having one client,” she said. Stitching denim together for sustainability-focused brands at Saitex International  Bien Hoa, Vietnam Mr. Bui has been at his factory for seven years. “It matches my skill,” he said, “and the salary is enough for my family.” He earns nine to 10 million dong a month (roughly $388 to $432), which he uses to support his mother, wife and son. During the average nine-hour workday, “I can finish 1,000 to 1,200 pieces a day, depending on the difficulty,” he said. Sews clasps and zippers onto dresses, blouses and pants at a factory   Los Angeles “I’m from Guatemala. I’ve been doing garment work for 16 years. I started because it was the only thing I knew how to do after leaving my home country,” Santiago said. “I came here because there were not as many opportunities back home, and with six children, there are a lot of expenses.” In the last five years, he has worked in five to eight factories. They are often windowless and dirty, with little ventilation, he said.  When he first moved to Los Angeles, Santiago was working 11-hour shifts, seven days a week. Now he works about 50 hours a week, taking home up to $350. The majority of his co-workers — around 30 other people — are Spanish speakers from Guatemala, El Salvador and Mexico.  “I’m just making ends meet,” he said. “I’m always trying to figure out how to save money, how to buy food, how to not eat out too much.” Still, he said it is better than what he was earning in Guatemala.   Self-employed seamstress  Caruaru, Brazil The last factory Ms. da Silva worked at produced men’s street wear. She spent eight years there, stitching side seams together in an assembly line with an hourly quota. “Some companies, like the one I worked for, no longer have employees inside the factory and the seamstresses work from home,” she said. “They establish small groups, tiny factories, and they are paid per item, so they basically have the same production without any costs.”  In order to make minimum wage, outsourced employees “have to work from day to night,” she said. Ms. da Silva now makes women’s clothing independently, producing fewer pieces and selling them locally. She makes “maybe half” of minimum wage, but she said it’s worth it to work at her own pace. “I love what I do,” she said. “I no longer see myself in that situation of sitting in front of a machine doing the same thing every day.”  She is planning on taking fashion design courses soon. “Seamstresses are the key element in the fashion chain, we are the ones who put the clothes together,” she said. “You basically have to kill yourself in front of a sewing machine in order to provide for your family.”  Leather quality control at Tod’s Group  Casette d’Ete, Italy Mr. Ripani, who began working with leather at 14, has been employed by Tod’s for more than 40 years, where he assesses “practically all the hides that arrive” for quality.  “Alone it’s hard to do everything, so I have a group of ragazzi [guys] under me and I have taught them everything I’ve been able to understand after all these years,” he said.  Mr. Ripani doesn’t earn much, he said, but he sets his own schedule, often working eight to 12 hours a day. He has assistants and has received   for his highly specialized work. “It’s not so much the salary, it’s that I am here because we’re all one family,” he said. “When I started, I had long hair. Now, I am bald.”  Security at Sitara Textile Industries  Faisalabad, Pakistan Rukhsana began working in the garment industry shortly after her husband died seven years ago. She works seven days a week. “The hardest thing about working in a textile mill is that management kind of cuts you off from the world for the duration of your shift. If anyone calls you from home — with good news or bad news — you can’t take the call and management doesn’t tell you until the day is over. Two years ago, my nephew died in an accident when I was working. My brother tried calling me, but management didn’t tell me about it until my family had already held his funeral. I was so upset, I quit my job. Now that I’m in security, I know when someone comes to the mill and tries to contact a worker. But I’m still not allowed to tell the worker their relative has been trying to reach them. It’s not just difficult, it’s impossible to survive on the salary the textile mills pay. Are we supposed to choose between buying food and roti or paying for clothes and medicine? And there’s always rent to pay in addition to that.” (Employees store their phones in a locker before beginning their shift, a company spokesman said in a phone interview, and they aren’t allowed to leave the organization “without any written acknowledgment from the manager.”  He said that family can reach employees on their cellphones or by calling the factory directly, and that he was not aware of any incidents in which family was prevented or delayed from contacting an employee during an emergency. )  Sews dress shirts for mass retailers at TAL Apparel  Binh Xuyen, Vinh Phuc, Vietnam Mr. Vu has spent the last four years working on a production line with about 30 other employees, each overseeing parts of the sewing process. On average, he earns about 10 to 12 million dong (about $432 to $518) monthly. He sends most of it back to his family.  “My favorite time is at 3 p.m., when we have an exercise session,” he said. “We stay at our work spot. We pause our work process, line up and follow the exercise instructions of team leaders.” He recently participated in a talent show hosted by the company, where he performed modern dance. “I don’t have plans to leave this job anytime soon,” he said. “I’m quite satisfied with it.”  Leather goods artisan at Louis Vuitton Saint-Pourçain-sur-Sioule, France Ms. Gamet began working with leather when she was 16 years old and has been employed by Vuitton for 23 years. “To be able to build bags and all, and to be able to sew behind the machine, to do hand-sewn products, it is my passion,” she said. “That’s how I got into it.” About 800 employees work in Saint-Pourçain, spread out across four sites. Ms. Gamet said the workshops are well organized, bright and modern. “The time flies by,” she said.  Tailor making pants and socks for fast fashion and active wear brands at Shahi Exports   India S.’s shift begins at 9 a.m. She feels a lot of pressure from supervisors to reach quotas of about 90 to 120 pieces per hour and said many workers are afraid to take breaks or use the restroom because it will waste time. Employees who can’t keep up are often pulled aside at the end of each hour, she said, and supervisors will yell at them and bang on tables. Many workers spend most of their 30-minute lunch breaks scrambling to finish more pieces to get back on track. “We don’t even have the freedom to drink water,” S. said, adding that management doesn’t allow employees to bring in water bottles. Instead, water is handed out by the factory. In the spring of 2018, the supplied water was making workers sick, and when employees gave management a letter with a variety of basic requests, including clean water, they were beaten in response. Their clothes were torn, and many of their valuables, including phones and jewelry, were taken. The employees took their complaint to the labor department. The issues were resolved three months after the incident, after the factory faced public pressure from a report by an American watchdog group, social media and brands that worked with the factory. Some conditions have improved: Employees get mineral water now. But the pay is still bad, S. said, and the main work space doesn’t have windows, air-conditioning or heaters.  “We want to ask for more salary, but people are scared after what happened last year to ask again,” she said. (In an email, a spokesman from Shahi Exports acknowledged the 2018 incident and forwarded a statement outlining   the company has since enacted. In a separate email, a spokesman said that berating employees in any way “constitutes misconduct,” and instances brought to management’s attention would “initiate action” against the perpetrator.  “While we do strive to drive efficiencies, there is no scope to berate any employee on account of non-performance or deficient performance,” he said. The spokesman added that there “is adequate ventilation” within the work space and that the entire factory is “in compliance with the law.”) S. is a single parent and picks up extra work in the evenings, along with taking out loans, to support herself and her daughter. “There are thousands of people” in her city in the same situation, she said. “My story is just one of them.”  Tailor at Friends Factory  Noida, India Ms. Bano has been a tailor for about 22 years and works at a progressive factory that makes small batches of garments for high-end independent brands. The building has little luxuries like air purifiers.  “It feels nice working here,” Ms. Bano said. “It’s clean. There are some plants and trees also, you know, the kind that are meant for decoration.”   Seamstress at Fantasia D!kas Roupas  Nova Friburgo, Brazil “I’ve always thought of myself as a seamstress. I even made my daughter’s sweet-16 dress. It looks like overlapping petals. It’s my greatest pride. I start work at 7 a.m. We make everything: pants, shorts, tops. I work eight hours a day Mondays to Fridays with a one-hour lunch break. It’s a small company: me and five other seamstresses. We don’t have a quota. Here they value quality over quantity. I don’t even know how many pieces I work on in a given day. We don’t keep track.” Ms. da Silva does not make enough money from her day job, so she picks up extra work from private clients to complete on evenings and weekends, sometimes working until 10 p.m.  “I prefer working for this manufacturer because I’m on the payroll, I’m entitled to vacations. It’s more secure. But my dream is to have my own atelier at home.” Knvul Sheikh contributed reporting."
"If I Expect It to End, Will It Hurt Less?",style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/26/style/modern-love-long-distance-friend-zone.html,"It started with a Facebook message from a boy I had known peripherally in elementary school lunchrooms, passing through the halls of our high school, and — the main event — seventh grade dance class. In our school, dance class was a special horror because we weren’t paired up by the teachers, which at least would have reduced the anxiety. Instead, boys were told to choose a girl — a humiliating experience for those chosen last or not at all. In seventh grade, I was already 6 feet tall, the tallest girl in my entire class, and taller than nearly every boy, putting me at risk of being among the unchosen. Well, he chose me, even though we hardly knew each other. That dance class was our one significant encounter, one that we each walked away from believing the other had been the rescuer. Now we were no longer schoolchildren; we were 27. And here, out of the blue, came a Facebook message from him reminiscing about the trauma of us being forced to learn ballroom dancing during our most awkward years. The anxiety of being lined up against the wall, waiting to see if someone would choose us or if we would be randomly assigned to join another couple when the numbers didn’t even out. The relief of a friendly face to make the experience a little less harrowing. Maybe that’s all it was supposed to be — a moment of gratitude for being each other’s friendly face. But it wasn’t. We started talking more, about where our lives were now, where we were headed, how he ended up moving to Australia, my plans to make the jump out of the United States the following year. When I said I didn’t know how I would carry over my career abroad, he sent me a dozen different ideas. When I told him that I didn’t want to miss out on some of my family’s eventual milestones — weddings, babies and so on — he argued those milestones never have an end date: “You come back for what’s important.” When I sighed over visa eligibility, he sent me information on all the places I was currently eligible and encouragement about how worthwhile it would be. He chipped away at all of my excuses. At the time, I didn’t have anyone in my life who understood the unconventional path I wanted to take. I had more people tugging on my shirtsleeve telling me to hang around for at least this last bachelorette party, or through that next promotion, or, from my then roommate, just one more year on our lease. He was the first one to call me out for dragging my heels. And maybe that’s all it was supposed to be — a spark of inspiration from someone who was doing what I wanted to do and encouraged me to follow through on my own dreams. But it wasn’t. He was coming back to the United States in a few weeks and would be in Chicago, so we decided to meet for drinks and catch up on old times we never had. He took the train downtown from his parents’ house in the suburbs. His mother had made him change his shirt and take an earlier train so he wouldn’t be late to meet me. We sat at a bar and ordered flights of craft beer, and he reluctantly played along with my beer flight rules of sipping each one and voting on our favorites. We talked about his life in Australia and his plans to go to New Zealand and then Antarctica and then Ireland and then Norway and then Germany and then the Falkland Islands. He gave me more advice and seemed genuinely excited for me, a rare investment from a guy who, despite our being in the same grade growing up, and the same dance class, was essentially a stranger. I noticed that I decompressed around him, that I could be myself without consequence. And maybe that’s all it was supposed to be — a mini middle-school reunion. But it wasn’t. I left him at the train station, telling him to get home safe as he recited back a very friend zoning “yes, ma’am,” wishing he had tried to kiss me. It was almost something. A week and a few flirty texts later, we decided to meet one last time before he got back to his life in Australia. He again came in by train, we went out for drinks, talked, then more drinks and more talking. This time I did not get left standing on the platform wanting more. He stayed over and we had a great night. A perfect night. A spontaneous night with no expectations or early-dating confusion or time to overthink things. It was comfortable and natural and just happened. And maybe that’s all it was supposed to be — a one-night stand. But it wasn’t. I kept waiting for the moment he would move on. He returned to Australia, and now we were trying to keep in touch across a massive time difference, and nothing more was ever promised. How long would it take him to get bored? The men I dated always timed out at about two months — usually in concert with a statement of having met someone new. But with this man, two months passed, then six, then nine, and we were still talking almost every day. Never in a way that pointed to a serious relationship, but certainly as more than just friends. I now knew his 15-year plan, his thoughts on marriage and past relationships, how he spent his summers on the farm, his poetic prowess and his irrational hatred of the movie “Frozen.” He knew about my dream to ditch my job and travel the world, my depressing music obsession, and every phrase that made me blush. It felt like this could actually be something. It felt like maybe, just maybe, it was even becoming something. I hoped that one day we would get a chance to find out. A year later, in February 2020, we saw each other in person again, meeting at a hotel in Chicago, a pit stop before his next contract sent him somewhere else far away. This time there were expectations, confusion and plenty of time to overthink — at least on my end. But once we were together, I got swept into that comfortable space again. We wasted no time and fell into bed, only leaving the room to meet the takeout delivery guy in the lobby. When we decided to go to sleep, he kept checking to see if I had dozed off yet; he wanted to avoid drifting off on me while I was awake. In part, I knew he was seeing if he was in the clear to uncuddle, since he has the body heat of a bear. Early on, I’d told him on a call that I understood how cuddling turns to sweltering really fast, but that I’m a sucker for holding hands. I could almost see his eyes roll through the phone. That night, I pretended to be asleep for one of his check-ins, so I was aware when he unfolded himself from me, then fumbled around under the covers until he found my hand and held it for the rest of the night. A few weeks later the world was in Covid-19 lockdown, and he shipped out to New York to work as a travel nurse. Our communication started to get spotty as he worked long hours in a job so intense that I am unable to fathom it. And it stayed that way for months, with me trying to walk the line between pick-me-up texts and not being annoying, and with him politely replying every so often. And then it happened. The moment I had been anticipating for the first two months, then six, then nine. He met someone new. Someone he was really excited about who he could see himself traveling the world with and trying to turn into a real relationship. Just like that, I was right back at the train station, watching him walk away, wondering if this is all it was supposed to be. Another almost something. From the start, I had tried to keep my expectations in check, telling myself there was a 99.999 percent chance it would end exactly this way, with him meeting someone and moving on. After all, for me it had never   happened that way. And this relationship was more logistically challenged than any I’d had before. But that .001 percent chance had never felt more possible. And I gave myself permission to be excited about him. And maybe that’s all it was supposed to be — me actually opening my heart again. Because in the end, that’s all it was. Another almost something. And I’m so sick of almost somethings. Jessie McNellis is a writer living in Chicago. Modern Love can be reached at  .

Tiny Love Stories: ‘I Didn’t Want Her to Stay Long’,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/style/tiny-modern-love-stories-i-didnt-want-her-to-stay-long.html,"“Why is this night different from all the others?” Last Passover, there were more ways than usual. My father was hospitalized with low oxygen. My mother and sister, also sick, spent the holiday clutching their phones in case he called. I was with my partner, crying over chicken broth, gripped by fear. This year, I remember the virus that passed over my own blood, sparing my father as the Israelites were spared from the final plague. I find new meaning in “Dayenu,” a Seder song of gratitude with the refrain: “It would have been enough.” My family’s health will always be enough. —  Midway through 2020, I started planting seeds in my backyard. My daughter said, “You’ve wanted to do this for years. Do you like it?” “Yes,” I said. “I love it.” At the time, I didn’t realize I was growing more than tomatoes. Overwhelmed by the pandemic, my mother’s worsening dementia and the painfully quiet demise of a decades-long relationship, I was sowing a future. My head down and hands busy, I could hope. “You seem calmer even though everything is more difficult,” my daughter said. Yes. Planting new seeds is hard. Realizing old seeds are no longer growing is harder. —  Grief was that relative I heard stories about. I knew her in the way I knew Uncle Gerald, someone I never met but learned so much about. Then my husband died, and there Grief was, shaking my hand. I offered her the guest bedroom, scrambling to make it comfortable, but not too comfortable because I didn’t want her to stay long. Instead of the guest bedroom, she marched right into my bedroom and dropped her heavy bags. Years later, she’s still with me, now an old friend, someone to sip martinis with and remember. —  In March 2009, two weeks after my students voted me teacher of the year, I learned I wouldn’t be returning to school after summer break. State budget cuts had threatened hundreds of thousands of public schoolteacher positions around the country. I finished the semester, teaching five high school Spanish classes with a total of 110 students. When they discovered that I wouldn’t be returning, a clandestine plan was set in motion. They surprised me, arriving at school wearing custom T-shirts that read “I support Ms. Minsky.” That expression of affection helped carry me through a dark time. —  See more Tiny Love Stories at  .

,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/20/style/zero-waste-daniel-trashion.html,"The ragpicker of Brooklyn works out of a 750-square-foot storefront a few blocks east of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, down a mostly residential side street in Williamsburg, where Hasidim and hipsters mix. The ragpicker of Brooklyn sews in the back, behind a makeshift wall sprouting a riot of scraps. Under the pattern-cutting table there are bins of scraps of scraps, sorted by color (red and yellow and blue and black), and on one wall are shelves of Mason jars containing gumball-size scraps of scraps of scraps; up front are clothing rails, and a dressing room canopied by a lavish waterfall of castoff cuttings that flows down onto the floor like a Gaudí sand castle. The ragpicker of Brooklyn, whose name is Daniel Silverstein and whose nom de style is Zero Waste Daniel, looks like a fashion kid, which he is (or was). He is 30 and tends to dress all in black, with a black knit cap on his head, and went to the Fashion Institute of Technology and interned at Carolina Herrera and even was on a fashion reality TV show. And the ragpicker of Brooklyn would rather not be called that at all. “I prefer to think of it as Rumpelstiltskin, spinning straw into gold,” Mr. Silverstein said one day in early November. He was on West 35th Street, in the garment district, with his partner and husband, Mario DeMarco (also all in black). They were hauling home sacks of cuttings from their own production run at HD Fashion, which also makes clothes for Rag & Bone and Donna Karan’s Urban Zen line. Mr. Silverstein’s straw is more formally known as preconsumer, postproduction waste, which is a fancy way of saying he works with the fabrics that other designers and costume departments and factories would normally throw out.  His gold is street wear: sweatshirts and pants and T-shirts, the occasional anorak, collaged together from rolls of old fabric, mostly black and gray, often containing brightly colored geometric patchwork inserts of smaller, brighter bits, like an exclamation point, or an Easter egg.  Those patchwork inserts have been put together from the castoffs of the bigger pieces, and then the castoffs from the inserts are saved and pieced together into mosaic appliqués (the hands from the Sistine Chapel and Earth as seen from above, for example). The appliqués can be custom-made and attached to any piece. Leftovers, all the way. As fashion comes to grips with its own culpability in the climate crisis, the concept of upcycling, whether remaking old clothes or re-engineering used fabric or simply using what would otherwise be tossed into landfill, has begun to trickle out to many layers of the fashion world.  That includes the high end, via the work of designers like  ,   and  , and brands like Hermès, as well as the outdoor space, with the Patagonia   and   programs (to name a few). And yet, because there are few economies of scale and even fewer production systems, such clothing remains for many designers an experiment rather than a strategy, and for many consumers, a luxury rather than a choice. Mr. Silverstein, whose clothes range from $25 for a patch to $595 for an anorak made from what was a New York City Sanitation Department tent, and who works only with fabric that would otherwise be thrown away, is one of several new designers trying to change that. How he got there, with lots of false starts and belly flops, is perhaps as representative as anything of the way fashion may be stumbling toward its future. We make too much, and we buy too much, but that doesn’t have to mean we waste too much.  Welcome to the growing world of trashion. “I came to New York for that fashion dream — what I’d been watching on TV,” Mr. Silverstein said a few weeks before his garment district scrap-saving trip. “I wanted that life so badly.” He was sitting in the back of what he calls his “make/shop,” which he and Mr. DeMarco renovated in 2017 using materials from Big Reuse, a Brooklyn nonprofit. The make/shop has three sewing machines but no garbage can. Mr. Silverstein was born in Pennsylvania, and when he was 10, his parents moved to New Jersey so their fashion-aware son could be closer to New York. Mr. Silverstein’s father owned a swimming pool and hot tub supply company, and his mother worked part-time in the business. (She is also a therapist.) As a family, they did some recycling but were not particularly attuned to the environment.  Mr. Silverstein always knew he wanted to be a designer. When he was 4, he started making clothes for his sister’s Barbies out of tissue paper and tinfoil. By the time he was 14, he was taking weekend classes at F.I.T. and making his friends’ prom dresses. His Damascene moment was more like a series of cold-water splashes. For a senior-year competition for the Clinton Global Initiative, he designed a pair of sustainable jeans, which became his first zero-waste pattern. He didn’t win, but his teacher told him to hold on to the idea. “‘You have something there,’” he recalled the teacher saying. After graduating, he found himself working as a temp at Victoria’s Secret, making knitwear. He would scroll through   looking at recent runway shows, find a sweater he liked, then create a technical design packet for a similar style for VS.  One of the patterns involved an asymmetric cut with a long triangular piece in front. Because of the irregular shape, the fabric “had an insanely poor yield,” Mr. Silverstein said, meaning that only a portion of every yard was used for the garment; almost half was waste.  He did the math and realized, he said, “that if this is yielding only 47 percent per each sweater, and we are cutting 10,000 sweaters, then we are knitting, milling, dying and finishing 5,000 yards of fabric just to throw out.” The next day, he said, he left VS to focus on a business he and a friend had started based on his zero-waste patterns. They were making classic ready-to-wear — cocktail dresses and suits and such — but with no waste left on the cutting-room floor. One of their first customers was Jennifer Hudson, who wore a turquoise dress that ended up in the pages of Us Weekly.  Stores like Fred Segal in Los Angeles and e-tail sites like Master & Muse picked up the line, which was called 100% (for the amount of fabric used), and Mr. Silverstein spent a season on the  ,” ending his tenure as second runner-up.  Still, the economics of fashion, in which stores pay after delivery, were working against him. In 2015, after American Apparel, which had bought Oak NYC, a store known for its edgy choices and one of his wholesale accounts, declared bankruptcy, he was left with $30,000 worth of unpaid orders. He decided to quit. Mr. Silverstein got a part-time job helping students get their art portfolios together and, he said, “lay on the couch for a while.” Finally he boxed up his studio and threw all of his leftover fabric in a garbage bag. He was set to haul it to a dumpster, only to have the bag break, spilling its contents onto the floor.  “I thought, ‘I can’t throw this out — it’s the antithesis of my mission,’” he said. “So I took the afternoon and made myself a shirt and put it on my Instagram. I had maybe 2,000 followers, and probably the most likes I had ever gotten was 95. I posted this dumb selfie of a shirt I’d made out of my own trash because I was too poor to go shopping, and it instantly got 200 likes. It was the most popular thing I’d ever done.” It occurred to him this may be a better way to go. He made “a bunch of scrappy shirts” and became Zero Waste Daniel, his Instagram name (which he had chosen because Daniel Silverstein was already taken).  He rented a booth at a flea market and sold them all. Johnny Wujek, Katy Perry’s stylist, bought one. Chris Anderson, a mentor who ran Dress for Success in Morris County, N.J., where Mr. Silverstein had interned during high school, said she would back him.  His father put in some money, too, as did Tuomo Tiisala, a professor at New York University who saw his work at a market. Mr. Silverstein got a small space at Manufacture New York, a group incubator in Sunset Park (it disbanded after a year), and made a deal with a factory that supplied the Marshalls chain to pick up its scraps. Fabric dumping, though less discussed than the clothes consumers throw out, is just as much a byproduct of fashion production, and just as culpable in the landfill crisis. Reverse Resources, a group that has created an online marketplace to connect factories and designers who want to reuse their scraps, released  that estimated that the garment industry creates almost enough leftover textile per year to cover the entire republic of Estonia with waste.  That was a best-case scenario. Worst case would be enough to cover North Korea. At that stage, Mr. Silverstein was mostly making sweatshirts, piecing them together by hand, but, he said, “people started making little videos about my work and putting up posts, and I started getting more orders than I could keep up with.”  In 2017, he met Mr. DeMarco, who worked in hospitality. This year he joined the business full-time. In many ways, social media has also been their door to a customer base. Just as it creates pressure to buy new stuff, it can create pressure to buy new old stuff. “My freshman year at F.I.T., one of my teachers said there are good designers and there are great designers,” Mr. Silverstein said. “Good designers have careers and see their stuff in stores, and great designers change the way people dress.” And, perhaps, think about dress.” He was driving a small U-Haul truck. He had spent the morning with Mr. DeMarco in FabScrap, a concrete loft in the erstwhile Army Terminal complex in Sunset Park filled with trash bags and storage boxes bulging at the seams with fabric waste. They were on the hunt for 400 or so yards of random black remnants with some stretch.  Mr. Silverstein doesn’t ragpick in the 19th-century way (the way that gave birth to the term), sifting through garbage on the streets. He picks through giant boxes and metal shelves of castoff fabric rolls and then sews his finds together to make new rolls. He doesn’t really have seasons or shows by a traditional definition, though he flirts with the idea. In 2018, the 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge invited him to do a show for New York Fashion Week, and instead of a runway, he decided to do a one-man stand-up routine called “Sustainable Fashion Is Hilarious,” which was more about concept than clothes.  The hotel sold tickets online, and all of the proceeds went to Fashion Revolution, a nonprofit that advocates industry reform. In September, he did the same at the   in Manhattan.  Mr. Silverstein is planning a performance for February at Arcadia Earth, the climate installation museum in downtown New York, which also sells some of his work. Last year the Sanitation Department came calling. It had done a collaboration with the   and was looking for another partner. While Mr. Preston saw the opportunity as a way to elevate the role of the sanitation worker in a one-off show, Mr. Silverstein saw it as a great partnership for raw material.  The department’s dead-stock T-shirts, tents and tablecloths have proven something of a treasure trove for him.  Over Thanksgiving weekend, Mr. Silverstein was one of the star companies in an American Express showcase on Small Business Saturday. He is also teaming up with a former mentor at Swimwear Anywhere for a line of bathing suits made in Taiwan, which will be his first foray into offshore production. (The scraps will be sent back along with the trunks and one-pieces, which are made from recycled ocean fishing nets.) Recently Lin-Manuel Miranda wore a Zero Waste Daniel sweatshirt at an Amex event. The drag queen Pattie Gonia wore a long mosaic gown based on Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus” at the Tony Awards in June and made Vogue’s  , albeit without identification.  The company has been profitable for a year, Mr. Silverstein said, and ships across the United States as well as to Canada, Britain, Brazil and Germany.  Now Mr. Silverstein is at another turning point. Does he get bigger? Does he train other ragpickers to do what he does? Does he open another outlet? Does he really get in the game? He is not sure. “I can’t clothe the world, and maybe the world doesn’t need me to,” he said. Maybe the drive to clothe the world is part of what created the problem he is now trying to solve in the first place. “When I think about what I want in terms of brand recognition, I would love to see this brand as a household name. But I think that’s very different than dollars. And I don’t want to be any bigger than I can guarantee it’s a zero-waste product or that I feel happy.”  He was gathering pieces for a Freddie Mercury mosaic. “Right now,” he said, surveying his mountain of scraps, “I am so happy.”"
How to Have a Wow Wedding for Two,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/style/intimate-wedding-elopement-trends-2021.html,"As weddings are moving away from big bashes to small-scale affairs because of the  , couples are embracing the fact that they can focus less on pleasing hundreds of guests and more on creating the perfect day for just the two of them. “An elopement no longer means that the event would be decided on and executed that same day or week, it just means that it will have the intimate feel and charm of impromptu nuptials, but be planned just like a large wedding would,” says Aya Kanai, the head of content and editorial partnerships at Pinterest. And, if space and protocol allow, many couples are having   with fewer than 10 family members and friends from their social bubble. “Small weddings are, of course, a reflection of the times we’re currently living in, but the aesthetic of the event is as important as ever,” Ms. Kanai said. “They’ve opened a lot of opportunities for couples to be more creative.” Here, bridal experts share the top trends that will help make your elopement or cozy fête magical. Since location is the main component of a wedding, we can expect lots of changes in venue selections for 2021 celebrations. As couples are scaling back their guest list, they are also being very intentional about where they choose to wed. “Couples have gotten really imaginative and are tying the knot in uncommon, picturesque locations just by themselves or with a tight group of family and friends, such as in a beautiful hidden courtyard, endless flower-filled field, or even underneath a waterfall,” said Michelle Norwood, the founder and creative director of  , based in New Orleans. “The more epic and off-the-beaten path the location the better.” Pairing the stunning outdoor space with an unforgettable dinner — such as a private chef on a yacht sailing around a scenic coastline, or a chic picnic on a secluded beach — is the ultimate goal. Couples will also take the at-home wedding up a notch by thinking beyond the customary tent — from building temporary structures from scratch to setting up transparent bubble tents that feel like private suites. “Couples are looking for a chic and immersive experience for their special day and that starts with a unique venue. They want a space that allows them to be in the moment,” said Yaz Quiles, the founder and owner of   and  , based in New York. “Unexpected venues that are better suited for smaller celebrations can offer a blank canvas to create the perfect atmosphere.” Giving up a long guest list definitely has its advantages when designing a dream wedding. Planners, floral designers, and event stylists are seeing a trend among couples who are hosting intimate events reallocating their original budgets toward lush florals, lavish stationery, and luxe tablescapes. The shift to bigger décor budgets and smaller venues has made the table the focal point of the event. “If you’re only having one table for under 10 or even two, think about how unique that could be. You’re no longer designing dozens of tables, so you can pay extra attention to the one you have,” said Kristin Shockley owner of  , based in Norfolk, Va. “Tablescapes are taking a new direction with still-life influenced designs where hors d’oeuvres are worked into décor, loose florals are placed around the table for extra romance, and bread isn’t just sitting in a basket or on a plate, but displayed on individual wooden serving boards along with fruit and nuts. This gives your guests more to look at on the table.” Couples are also thinking about how they can extend their floral designs beyond the tabletop or installations above the table. “The right florals can transform a small space,” Ms. Shockley said. “We’re seeing play with blooms, such as entwining around chair backs and legs, sprouting from the floor around the table, and climbing a wall.” With no guest list to worry about, or the addition of just a few guests, couples will be gravitating to a more luxurious and selective menu for their wedding celebration. “We’ll see couples going all out with elevated meal experiences, such as multiple courses, food-and-wine pairings, individual cheese platters and grazing boards, and extravagant food like caviar,” said Alexandra Dettori, the executive chef and founder of  , based in New York. Stylish food and drink trucks featuring creative menus for guests keeping distance outdoors will continue to be popular, as well as chic, yet Covid-safe, food presentations like beautifully-packaged individual courses and grazing boxes. “For couples wanting a posh sit-down dining experience, we see many taking culinary artistry to a new level,” said Ms. Norwood. “We expect more couples asking for dishes that look like pieces of art that you can eat, which are pre-plated and served table side to each guest.” Elegant, individual presentations won’t be just for the main courses. Weddings cakes will also be smaller in size, but more dramatic in detail. Compact single-tier, petite two-layer, and mini individual cakes will be a highlight of the wedding dinner. “I’m noticing many couples who are having smaller weddings are asking for fancier treats. This helps make their day extra special, especially if it’s just the two of them,” says Dawn Konofaos, the owner of  , based in Baltimore. “One-tier cakes feel unique when on the taller side — at least seven to eight inches in height and six inches in diameter. A small two-tier cake still maintains a bit of tradition and individual mini cakes are not only Covid-friendly, but also cute and much more elaborate than in previous years.” Couples will also be more creative with cake flavors by incorporating spices and herbs that aren’t typically used in wedding cakes. “I’m finding that basil, lemon thyme, and sage are having a moment in the spotlight,” Ms. Konofaos said. “As for style, we’ll see more texture and painterly designs.” Elopements and intimate weddings are giving way to leisurely, seated dinners with music being used to compliment the menu and guide the event. “Soft, ambient music performed by a soloist or duo is taking the place of high-energy dance music played by a D.J. or large band. It’s all about intentionality, mindfulness, and designing a wedding that feels true to the couple’s love story,” said Keanna O’Quinn, the founder of  , based in New York. “Science tells us that music influences taste perception, so we collaborate with caterers to arrange music to enhance the menu’s flavors, creating an interactive, sensory experience.” Because many couples will be opting for no dancing at their wedding receptions, this will allow them to be more attentive to the quality of music. “I see more couples steering clear of the typical wedding tunes and instead curating a creative live-music playlist, such as a custom soundscape of soul music consisting of B-side classics that are well known, but less played.” While weddings are getting smaller, brides are going bigger with their wedding day look. I’m seeing simplicity with a more-is-more mind-set, which we’ve begun to refer to as ‘minimal maximalism’,” said bridal designer  . “Two of the top looks brides are requesting are streamlined, off-the-shoulder gowns and clean silhouettes with more design details, in particularly statement sleeves — from large shoulder puffs to draped long sleeves that look like a sweater.” “After going so long without social engagements to dress up for, even the laid-back bride will be looking for a little something extra, something simple and refined but with a striking focal point,” said Margo Lafontaine, the design director at  . “With minimonies being attended by so many virtual guests, details like bishop sleeves, a dramatic bow, and embroidered tulle cape-like sleeves, which stand out on camera are all the more important.”"
A Funny Thing Happened at the College Reunion,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/style/a-funny-thing-happened-at-the-college-reunion.html,"Alexis Branagan and Patrick Ryan arrived separately at the Cloister Inn eating club at Princeton in June 2017. Although they didn’t know each other, Ms. Branagan, 31, who graduated from Princeton in 2011, and Mr. Ryan, 34, who graduated in 2009, were all-too familiar with the annual Princeton reunions event, which Ms. Branagan was attending for the sixth year in a row, and Mr. Ryan for an eighth. Mr. Ryan’s reunions streak got off to a late start as he served nearly four years after graduating as a Marine Corps officer, primarily as a staff officer at the Third Intelligence Battalion in Okinawa, Japan.  “It’s one huge party,” said Ms. Branagan, a professional ballet dancer, ballet teacher, and arts administrator who is a member of the New York Theatre Ballet, a touring chamber company. She went on to describe one particular moment at the reunion. “I walked down the staircase with my friends,” she said, “and our eyes just locked.” “I immediately felt this special connection,” she added, “and since I was the one walking down the stairs, I made a beeline toward him.” Mr. Ryan, a vice president at Edelman, where he advises companies on investor relations and financial communications, spoke briefly that day with Ms. Branagan before asking her out. She was living in Astoria, Queens at the time, he in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. She said yes and they exchanged phone numbers, and a few days later met at bar near Penn Station, where they spent hours talking. “The conversation flowed,” Ms. Branagan said. “We found so many commonalities between us.” One of those common traits was a sense of humor, which paved the way for a smooth evening as far as Mr. Ryan was concerned. “She laughed at all of my jokes, and that was a good sign” he said. “Our families were both from Ireland, so there was a lot in common there as well.” Within a month, they were serious, and dated steadily until October 2019, when they got engaged. “Patrick brought a real and true ease to my life,” Ms. Branagan said. “I never thought ‘Oh, he’s not going to like that,’ and I never had to question my next move, it was just me being me, and so I never had to question as to whether or not I made the right move in being with him.” They were married Jan. 17 by Msgr. Thomas Mullelly at St. Aedan’s, the St. Peter’s University Church in Jersey City, N.J. The Rev. Rocco Danzi, a Roman Catholic priest, took part in the ceremony. The bride estimated that 50-70 guests — “well-distanced from one another” — were in attendance. (New Jersey’s restrictions allow for up to 150 people or 25 percent of the room’s capacity; St. Aedan’s seats 1,500.) The coronavirus changed two sets of original plans, the first a planned ceremony at St. Anthony’s Roman Catholic Church in Hawthorne, N.J., and the second at Cairnwood Estate, a wedding venue in Bryn Athyn, Pa. “When as the holidays came, this glorious Plan B didn’t make sense any longer,” the bride said. “We felt better about hosting something in a larger cathedral, and not hosting any indoor dining.”"
A Kiss Before the Barristers’ Ball and Now They’ve Made it Legal,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/style/a-kiss-before-the-barristers-ball-and-now-theyve-made-it-legal.html,"Alexandra Newman White and Joel Benzion Kuzniecky met in September 2014 on their first day at Fordham Law school in New York. They were randomly assigned seats next to each other in a property law class. They were both in Section 5. A couple of weeks later, when she spotted him on a crowded Union Square subway platform around 7:30 a.m., she walked over. “Hey, you’re in my class,” she said, and then did most of the talking as they headed northbound to class. “He was the shy and mysterious kid who knew the answers to every question when cold called on,” said Ms. White, 28, who graduated from Northwestern and is now a law clerk for Lori S. Sattler, a justice for the New York County Supreme Court in the first judicial district of New York.  Ms. White, driven in her studies, also worked at a matrimonial law firm, and during what little free time she had, she hung out with other classmates. Mr. Kuzniecky kept mostly to himself. “I had a big social circle outside law school,” said Mr. Kuzniecky, 31, who graduated cum laude from N.Y.U. He is now an associate in the asset management group at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriber & Jacobson in New York. As law school intensified so did their friendship. They spent hours studying together at the law school library. “If you’re in his inner circle, his shyness goes out the door,” she said. In March 2015, after they each handed in law briefs for a legal writing class, they decided to celebrate with a drink at a bar near her apartment near Union Square. He lived a few blocks away. “I remember we had the most fun and I couldn’t stop laughing,” she said, and later, outside the bar, she leaned in to kiss him. “We were friends, but knew something special had just happened,” he said. In May, after they got out of a cab they took to the law school’s annual Barristers’ Ball, he kissed her. Though it wasn’t an official date, they hung out and danced the night away. “Time flew by with flirty texts,” she said. After their last final they began spending more time together, and within weeks were inseparable. Early on when his best friend blurted out “you are going to marry her,” right in front of her, they laughed it off. Ms. White, who minored in Spanish in college, said he soon courted her “with old-fashioned dates” and “Latin-Southern charm.” “I’m traditional,” he said. “My parents are Panamanian and I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama.” In September 2015, the day after he met her parents in Westhampton, N.Y., she celebrated Rosh Hashana with his family in Englewood, N.J. “There’s always a Latin twist on the Jewish classics in that house,” she said. “It’s always so warm and fun.” Starting in June 2017, over the next three months they studied hours on end for the bar exam. In October, they received the results within a minute of each other via email: they both passed.  In August 2019, he proposed on a secluded beach on Shelter Island, and soon they planned to be married Feb. 14, 2021 at the Metropolitan Club in New York with more than 300 guests; about a third would fly in from Panama. After holding out as long as they could, at the end of 2020, in the face of the ongoing  , they changed their plans, but kept the date. On Feb. 14, Rabbi Eytan Hammerman officiated at the home of the bride’s parents in Harrison, N.Y., where Latin jazz played during the cocktail hour, and the rabbi recited one of the traditional seven blessings in Spanish during the ceremony before only immediate family, with about 350 others watching via livestream from around the world.   “Our cultures melded into a magical evening,” Mr. Kuzniecky said."
,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/style/self-care/black-book-clubs.html,"“I want people to think radically,” said Noname, the 28-year-old rapper, in a phone interview this month from her home in Los Angeles. She is outspoken, especially on Twitter, about dismantling patriarchy, white supremacy and capitalism, but over the last year she has also been opening people’s minds through a more analog medium. It started in July 2019, when she posted a photo of “Jackson Rising: The Struggle for Economic Democracy and Black Self‑Determination in Jackson, Mississippi,” a collection of essays about the movement to develop cooperative economic practices in the capital of America’s poorest state. Later, another Twitter user replied with a photo of the book and suggested that they become “pen pals and swap notes.” Thus began the  , a reading group focused on texts by authors of color (tagline: “reading material for the homies”). Hers is one of many Black- and women-led book clubs people are turning to in the midst of a virus that has alienated people from their communities and a continuing global conversation about anti-Black racism. What is essential to each of these groups — and why members find them appealing — has a lot to do with leaders creating a space free of the white gaze. The Black book club has, over time, served as a space of critical study, leisure and fellowship. In the 19th century, free Black Americans in the North saw literary societies and the organized literary activities that they sponsored “as one way to arrest the attention of the public, assert their racial and American identities, and give voice to their belief in the promises of democracy,” Elizabeth McHenry wrote in “Forgotten Readers: Recovering the Lost History of African American Literary Societies.” Dr. McHenry also notes in her book that “not every member of African American literary societies wanted to be a writer or enjoyed an unmediated relationship with texts.” Some members weren’t even literate, so they relied on others to share information. At the end of the 20th century, the Black-led book club became a national phenomenon and a commercial success. Oprah’s Book Club, founded by Oprah Winfrey in 1996, introduced readers to Black authors including Toni Morrison and Pearl Cleage in the 1990s and early aughts. Ms. Winfrey helped bring Black literature to non-Black consumers and created a blueprint for celebrities of all stripes to become literary tastemakers. Of course, many of Oprah’s readers — and   to them — have been white. The protests following the killings of George Floyd, Tony McDade, Breonna Taylor and countless others have led many people, most of them white, to immerse themselves in books about race in America, like the best-selling titles “ ,” by Ibram X. Kendi, and “ ” by Robin DiAngelo. At , a pop-up and online bookstore owned by Katie Mitchell and her mother, Katherine, recent purchasing trends reflect non-Black customers’ desire to better understand race and whiteness. “I’ve definitely seen a surge in demand for anti-racist reading, nonfiction that really exposes systemic racism,” Ms. Mitchell said. Those books are usually purchased by newer customers. Since its founding in August 2019, Noname’s book club has grown to nearly 10,000 Patreon subscribers, who pay at least $1 a month for membership. Others follow her book recommendations on Twitter and support the club by buying merchandise. Though her mother,  , owned a bookstore in Chicago, Noname did not necessarily inherit her bookish tendencies. “I wasn’t really interested in reading,” she said of her grade-school years. And even now, “I’m pretty insecure about it. I’m just doing it now because I think it’s important, and I do love language and literature.” Her more recent interest in reading was born out of the formation of her politics. “I’m still doing the reading, learning,” she said. She supports abolition — “of the U.S. empire,” she said, but especially  , an idea that has gained broader support in recent months. Activists have pushed for local policing budgets to be redirected toward social and mental health services. She posts about many of these ideas on Twitter, where she is the recipient of much adoration and vitriol. “Anything that’s going to be pro-liberation, I’ll always tweet that without hesitation,” she said. “I think when you start questioning systems, it helps you to open up other parts of your humanity.” Her work expands to other forms of social activism, including sending literature to incarcerated people. The future of her book club includes plans to start a grocery drive and provide cooked meals for the homeless in Los Angeles, where she lives. “The Free Reading Program,” which she plans to start once she reaches 10,000 subscribers, will focus on one essay a month and will be facilitated by organizers and educators, according to the book club’s Patreon page. The program is specifically focused on political education, and will focus on themes like Marxism and feminism. “We read books, but under the umbrella that I am continuously trying to expand different initiatives through book club,” she said. The vlogger known as , who founded the book club  , believes there is a privilege associated with selecting and interpreting texts, so the space she has created is an attempt to remedy that. “We have a cohort of Black women graduate-level researchers who produce what we call syllabi that walk you through the readings we’re doing to make the books more accessible,” she said. Those materials include background on each author, a book overview, themes and motifs, reading tips, discussion questions and suggestions of similar books to read next. Expanding the kinds of Black stories that are centered is what prompted K Bailey Obazee, 30, to start , a book club in London that she describes as “hella Black and hella gay.” (“Okha” means “tale” in Edo, the language spoken in the state in Nigeria where she is from.) Ms. Obazee grew tired of seeing the same Black authors promoted over and over again. “We kind of try and make sure that you are reading books, not just by the same people and not just by people who are well known,” she said. Beyond the texts that are discussed, physical space is also key, particularly for Ms. Obazee’s largely queer membership (though the pandemic has put in-person meetings on hold). “It’s nice to create a safe space, somewhere that can primarily be a sober space, particularly for those who don’t drink, for those who don’t want to party but still want to engage and connect with their community,” Ms. Obazee said. The club serves as an exhibition as well, where Black and queer artists’ work is on display. “That’s an opportunity for people who come to the book club to also become accustomed to the other forms of storytelling,” she said, “because it’s not just written. We tell stories in varying mediums.” There are chapters of the Well-Read Black Girl book club, founded by Glory Edim, 36, in independent bookstores across all 50 states, thanks to a partnership with the American Booksellers Association. The clubs are self-directed but follow the same book recommendations, which include one monthly title for adults and one for Y.A. readers. The book club also holds an annual  , now in its fourth year. Past participants have included the novelist Jacqueline Woodson and the poets Aja Monet and Staceyann Chin. “Last year our theme was reading as resistance, and it being a kind of radical act,” Ms. Edim said. This year’s event, which does not yet have a date, will be virtual, but its ambition is just as huge: “Trying to find ways to just have a really positive impact and move towards the Black liberation,” she said."
"These Hand Sanitizers Smell Good, Kill Germs",style,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/style/these-hand-sanitizers-smell-good-kill-germs.html,"At Cecconi’s in the Dumbo neighborhood of Brooklyn and in West Hollywood, Calif., diners are offered more than a grind of fresh pepper or a spoonful of grated Parmesan with their meal. On many tables, where you may expect to find a bottle of olive oil or hot sauce, there’s Amass Botanic Hand Sanitizer, a spicy-scented cleanser to keep the restaurant’s guests germ free. The product is one of a new crop of upscale hand sanitizers, frequently formulated with refined scents and emollients. Like the standard versions, these have an alcohol base but aim to offer a more indulgent experience than, say, a smear of Purell or a quick rub with a disinfecting wipe. “This is becoming a quotidian ritual for people, an everyday thing that’s part of their lives,” said Morgan McLachlan, a founder and the master distiller at Amass, a Los Angeles company that focused on spirits before it began producing hand sanitizer in March. “Why not have it be a pleasurable experience?” The company’s Botanic Hand Sanitizer is a light liquid that, if poured into a glass, could be mistaken for gin. The spicy scent, called Four Thieves, is redolent with clove and cinnamon; it brings to mind a wintry fruitcake. The name and formula were inspired by medieval criminals who, according to legend, avoided contracting the bubonic plague by anointing themselves with a similar blend of botanicals, Ms. McLachlan said. A second scent, an herbaceous blend called Basilisk Breath, was introduced on July 16. Beauty brands are also introducing hand sanitizers.  , a popular skin care line, came out with one last month with moisturizing squalane. The Brooklyn fragrance house   added one with a eucalyptus-based scent to its collection in April. The skin care line   unveiled its version in April; the makeup brand   introduced hand sanitizer in June.  , the influential beauty boutique in Brooklyn, created one it began selling this month. Predictably, these elevated products come with a commensurate price tag. At $12 for a two-ounce bottle, the Amass hand sanitizer costs about eight times as much as a purse-size hand sanitizer at CVS. On the other hand, Augustinus Bader, the cultish German line that includes a $165 body cream, has, since May, been offering a limited supply of the hand sanitizer it created for front line workers to consumers for free, for a small shipping fee. Higher prices haven’t necessarily deterred shoppers. March and April sales of  , which was introduced in 1997 and costs between $10 and $18, depending on size, exceeded those for all of last year, according to a representative of the brand. (Admittedly, one factor of high sales could be the low supply, at least early in the pandemic, of traditional hand sanitizers, although some high-end brands have also sold out of these products over the last couple of months.) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommends a minimum concentration of 60 percent alcohol in these products; in upscale versions, that percentage is often much higher. “The higher the concentration, perhaps the more effective, but it’s more damaging to the outer skin layer,” said Dr. Joshua Zeichner, the director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. “That can lead to cracks in the outer skin layer, loss of hydration and inflammation,” he said. Moisturizing after use is advised. Of course, simply decanting basic hand sanitizer into a fancy container can make it feel more glamorous. Early this month, sleek sanitizer dispensers in polished steel were installed in the Tom Ford Madison Avenue boutique. They were created by  , a new brand founded by Jonathan Reed, who also runs a company that produces physical and digital events. One of the receptacles, a shiny silver box filled with disinfecting wipes, looks like a designer take on a package of tissues. Another, a narrow tower that dispenses squirts of sanitizer, could be a luxurious water cooler. Their aesthetic is, of course, more in sync with the boutique’s grand black staircase and marble detailing than, say, the packs of cleaning products at the Duane Reade a couple of blocks away. Mr. Reed said that other high-end stores are interested in using the dispensers, which are designed to use with a variety of sanitizers. He added that Pureté System’s own line of hand sanitizer, scented with white musk and rose, will be introduced in the next couple of months. The new company’s goal, he said, was to offer a sophisticated way to incorporate something that’s now part of everyday life. “I don’t think it’s going away,” he said. “This is our new reality.”"
Can Unsexy Beauty Be Sexy?,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/style/can-unsexy-beauty-be-sexy.html,"Two years ago, when Jules Miller, the co-founder and chief executive of  , a line of vitamin supplements, tried to get her brand on shelves at Barneys New York, a buyer at the store was horrified that Ms. Miller wanted to sell products for bloating and constipation next to high-end skin care and makeup. It was easy to get behind ingestible beauty: the idea that consuming capsules or powders could make skin radiant, nails stronger or hair lustrous. But Barneys, now closed, could not conceive of placing items promoting gut health, specifically one that claimed to relieve chronic bloating, on its beauty floor. “It wasn’t always an understanding that retailers had,” Ms. Miller said. Even so, the Nue Co.’s Prebiotic + Probiotic and Debloat Food + Prebiotic cocktail of digestive enzymes and prebiotics was not a taboo concept to consumers. Combined, the two products make up almost a third of the Nue Co.’s sales, according to Ms. Miller. Barneys, she said, came back a year later and started stocking the line. “We get it now,” she said the store told her. Katie Sturino, the founder of  , has built an entire brand around products for thigh chafing, breast sweat and melasma mustaches (skin discoloration from sun exposure on the upper lip). In early days, Ms. Sturino said she was met with “giggling” and “snickers” when she came out with Thigh Rescue, an anti-chafe stick, but now Megababe is sold in Target and Ulta Beauty stores. The Nue Co. and Megababe are part of a group of brands that address unsexy beauty and grooming concerns using slick packaging and candid, unconventional messaging. These companies are encouraging consumers to discard the embarrassment or shame we typically feel about butt acne, dandruff or toe hair. The key, Ms. Miller and Ms. Sturino believe, is using traditional beauty brands as a blueprint, at least when it comes to their aesthetic and the kinds of stores to sell their products. The Nue Co.’s gut health supplements and Megababe powders that absorb breast sweat (Bust Dust) give off cool Gen Z vibes. They are not products that remind you of a doctor’s office or GNC. What sets Ms. Sturino, who is also a plus-size influencer with more than half a million Instagram followers, apart from some of the biggest names in beauty is the way she talks about her brand. She approaches Megababe the same way she does her body: with unabashed positivity, acceptance and no filter. Ms. Sturino reminds customers that thighs rubbing together, a breakout on your behind and a post-summer mustache are normal. “We had an example of a beauty editor who used our product but wouldn’t write about it because she didn’t want to be associated with chafe,” she said. , a new hair-care line started by Robbie Salter and Ross Goodhart, who call themselves “lifelong flake fighters,” is trying to do something similar. The two are gunning for Head & Shoulders’ younger customers, armed with the tagline “Zero Flakes Given” and what they describe as a youthful alternative to a decades-old drugstore aisle product. Jupiter’s Balancing Shampoo contains zinc pyrithione, the active ingredient in Head & Shoulders that treats dandruff, and also looks good in the shower. “Existing brands have intentionally stigmatized the category,” Mr. Goodhart said. “From our angle, a significant percent of the population has it, and we say, ‘Just use our products and don’t worry about it.’” What’s going on in these markets is not much different from what happened with soaps and household cleaning products: taking something inherently unsexy — hand soap or all-surface cleaner — and repackaging it to appeal to millennials. That is what put   soaps on the map. In 2017, Method was acquired by SC Johnson, the owner of Windex, Scrubbing Bubbles and Shout. Soap may be an easier sell for the TikTok generation (and their parents) than dandruff shampoo, but Kevin Spight, a brand consultant, believes you can create a multimillion-dollar company around a taboo concept. ­­­ “You need that niche or hero product to carve your space,” Mr. Spight said. “From there, you create your following and your advocates. People want brands that represent their personal ethos. It’s a badge of honor now.” , a women’s razor line that came out in 2017, has worked to reduce the stigma associated with women’s body hair, including with ad campaigns with toe hair and a close-up of a bikini bottom with pubic hair peeking out. In 2018, its Project Body Hair video amassed millions of views over several months on YouTube and other platforms. It took months for Georgina Gooley, a founder of Billie, to figure out how a razor brand should talk about (and celebrate) body hair. Billie not only acknowledges that body hair exists, she explained, but also endorses the belief that shaving is a choice, not an expectation. For decades, ads for women’s razors showed only legs that were a mile long and completely hairless. “You couldn’t even get a good visual of a product demonstration,” Ms. Gooley said. Body hair was so taboo, she said, that commercials didn’t even acknowledge that women had hair. Decades ago, she said, women sneaked out of bed to put makeup on while their partners were asleep, pretending that’s how they woke up. (Cue Midge Maisel of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” who waits for her husband to fall asleep so she can take off her makeup — only to wake up before he does so she can apply a fresh face of it.) “You’re going to see that very direct advertising a lot more often because women have become a lot less embarrassed,” said Monique Woodard, the managing director of Cake Ventures, a venture capital firm. That may be true, but only recently have brands like Billie started to challenge industry norms. In 2004, Dove’s Real Beauty campaign showcased “real” women’s bodies, and 13 years later Glossier did the same with Body Hero, but these are exceptions. Much of the beauty industry is still fueled by marketing that conveys unrealistic physical ideals. Margaret Hiestand, 33, who works in community relations for the Chicago White Sox, said that Ms. Sturino is one of a few influencer accounts she follows on social media because she is plain-spoken about things like “sweating in weird places.” “A lot of brands are like: ‘Here is this beautiful model with this flawless skin. Please use this product,’” Ms. Hiestand said. “She does it differently.” Ms. Hiestand was referring to videos on Instagram where Ms. Sturino is, she said, “borderline naked” in her bathroom applying Le Tush clarifying butt mask or “throwing up a leg” to apply chafe stick to her inner thighs. “There is nothing taboo when it comes to the human body,” said Dr. Shereene Idriss, a dermatologist in New York. Melasma and dandruff are among the most common skin conditions she treats, along with acne. “I hope these brands make it mainstream to be human,” Dr. Idriss said. Beatrice Dixon, the founder and chief executive of  , has no qualms talking about human issues. Her line makes nothing but what she calls “vagina products.” “What people don’t want to do or talk about are the things that you should absolutely be selling,” said Ms. Dixon, whose brand is sold at Walmart, Target, CVS and Walgreens. A Sensitive collection of feminine wash and wipes that “kiss feeling dry goodbye” are among the line’s best sellers. “Infections and odor and all of the things people deem to be these terrible things, I go out of my way to discuss those things,” she said. “Because they’re absolutely normal.”"
"After 80 Years, Still Smiling on the Job",style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/fashion/weddings/after-80-years-still-smiling-on-the-job.html,"Fred Marcus, who was a longtime wedding photographer in New York, often said: “When the wedding is over the photographs will last forever. So will the relationships we made at that event.” Decades later both statements still ring true. In January, the Fred Marcus Studio celebrated 80 years in business. The studio, which has always specialized in weddings, is one of the few multigenerational owned and run photography business still thriving in New York. After more than seven decades on West 72nd Street, the company moved to its current 58th Street location in Columbus Circle in 2019. In doing so, they packed up thousands of photographs, volumes of digital archives and stirred memories created over the years. They went from a 4,000 square feet space operating out of three different floors to 2,500 feet, which was all on one level, making it more cohesive for everyone to work. For over a month, they packed up 300 plus boxes, which contained 30 years worth of negatives and digital material, most of which were put in a storage unit.  They moved to the new space with more than a dozen cameras, lighting equipment, large printer, photo backgrounds, and 50-plus albums filled with archival photos. The rent at their previous location was exorbitant, they said, and they needed a less expensive location. According to family lore, in 1939, Fred Marcus was a 29-year-old escaped Holocaust survivor living in Cuba. He made money taking pictures of families on the beach. “All he knew was how to take photographs and connect with people,” said his son, Andy Marcus, 71, who lives on the Upper West Side with Judi Marcus, his wife and the manager of the studio.  “When I was little I asked him why he did weddings. He took out the Yellow Pages and flipped to commercial fashion photographers. There were pages of them. Then he went to wedding photographers. Only three or four were listed. He wanted to excel at something others didn’t.” Fred Marcus was 31 in 1941 when he opened his studio in the basement floor in a building on West 72nd Street. Several years later, in an effort to keep his then 13-year-old son, Andy, out of trouble, he made him a lighting assistant at the weddings he was shooting. “Afterward we’d swap out the used film for new film at 2 a.m. in the closet. We put a towel on the floor to block the light from entering,” Andy Marcus said. “We’d talk about the wedding. It was a wonderful way to get to know him.” Andy Marcus never left the business. After graduating college he started working at the studio full time. When his father was injured in a car accident in 1975, Andy Marcus stepped up. “I was left on my own to run the business,” he said. “I didn’t have a clue how to do that. I just knew I had to make it work. I wanted him to be proud of me.” While Fred Marcus spent seven months in the hospital, Andy Marcus was thriving. The first torch was passed. “When I started, each photo required one flash bulb. Then you had to change the film,” he said. “The most photos you took at a wedding were 80 to 100. When digital came in the early 2000s, it changed everything. Now you can take 100 photos of the bride’s shoes.” What has not changed are the client’s desires regarding what to capture. “We’re known for expressive, well-lit family portraits. It keeps our legacy going,” said Andy Marcus. In 2001, Fred Marcus, then 91, died. Over the years Andy Marcus expanded the business, brought new energy, fresh ideas, raised prices and increased clientele. The ’80s and early ’90s brought opulence and over-the-top events. “The weddings were larger, there were more flowers, bigger bands, everything was on steroids,” Andy Marcus said. The wedding industry grew. Celebrities became clients. Today average packages start around $9,000 to $20,000, though some clients have spent more than $150,000. Then, Andy’s son, Brian Marcus, who learned the business the same way his father did, joined the business in 2003, returning to the East Coast after college and a brief job working as a production assistant at a film company in Los Angeles. “This is a job my family has been passionately ingrained in forever,” said Brian Marcus, 42, who lives in Tenafly, N.J. Brian Marcus, who is now the company’s president, took over the business two years ago when his father started to slow down. His father still shoots weddings, meets with clients, and helps with photo selection and designing the albums. “Being born into this, I already had a leg up because clients trusted me,” Brian Marcus said. They knew I had the knowledge and ability. Then I had to keep their trust and prove myself. Everyday I work to earn the respect my father and grandfather built.” Today, not including Andy or Brian, they have six full-time employees. That includes the two photographers who work in the studio, cover weddings and handle production. Fifteen part-time staffers help with photography, video and lighting. They have photographed more than 30,000 weddings, traveling around the world to capture couples on film and video. Among the celebrities they have witnessed saying ‘I do’ are: Mary Tyler Moore and Dr. Robert Levine, Billy Baldwin and Chynna Phillips, Eddie Murphy and Nicole Mitchell, Mario and Matilda Cuomo’s daughter and granddaughter, and Senator Chuck and Iris Schumer’s daughter. They also photographed the weddings of Donald Trump and Marla Maples, and Ivanka and Jared Kushner. “My father knew how to take a photograph. Back then you couldn’t look at what you got to see if you captured the couple or the cake or people dancing. You had to trust you got the shot,” said Andy Marcus, who added that the wedding and event business could be an all-consuming, seven-day-a-week job. “It’s hard on your personal life. You can miss a lot of weekends and holidays with your family because you’re documenting other people celebrating them.” But it is in these celebrations that the Marcus family has spent a lifetime capturing and creating a generational footprint. “Seventy years ago, Fred Marcus shot my parent’s wedding, and 46 years ago shot mine,” said Judy Kaufthal, 67, of the Bronx. “This was a long-term relationship. I’ve known all of them. They did my three sons’ weddings. Fred, who wasn’t working anymore, came to my oldest son’s wedding just to give him a hug. That’s a special thing.” In the wedding industry, nostalgia is everything. “My father had a wonderful way with people. He told me to never say ‘smile’ to someone. Talk to them instead,” Andy Marcus said. “He built relationships. Then he kept them. I did, too. So does Brian. That’s how we keep this going. That’s why we’re still here.”"
Out-of-the-Box Bridal Fashion Inspiration,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/fashion/weddings/bridal-inspiration-london-fashion-week.html,"Last year very few brides walked down the aisle as planned. According to wedding planning app, Bridebook.com, an estimated 15 million weddings around the world were postponed because of the pandemic. In the United Kingdom, where weddings have been banned or restricted since last spring, many brides simply decided to embrace smaller, more intimate ceremonies and with it, a sense of freedom. And many women looked to the runway for bridal fashion inspiration. “Versatile pieces such as the draped high-neck Midi-dress from Emilia Wickstead, tailoring from Christopher Kane, full length dresses from Vivienne Westwood and Stephen Jones headpieces have all performed well,” said Natalie Kingham, the global fashion officer at   the London-based luxury retailer. The retailer launched its own ‘wedding edit’ at the beginning of 2020. “We predict a shift toward feminine, romantic wedding dresses and statement pieces that will make an impact on the big day,” Ms. Kingham said. While not everyone has the budget for high fashion, the shift away from traditional bridalwear has certainly been noticeable. In a 2020 report conducted by Bridebook.com, 67 percent of brides no longer want a traditional wedding dress. “The wear-once meringue dress is being passed over, in favor of trouser suits and dramatic silk separates that can be dyed a different color for a new lease of life,” said the founder Hamish Shephard. The search for jumpsuits and trouser suits increased 200 percent last year on the app. Awon Golding, the London-based milliner known for her contemporary headpieces, wore a jumpsuit on her wedding day four years ago in Goa, India. Now she’s busy making headpieces for brides who have all had to downsize their nuptials. “People are choosing shorter dresses, rather than long gowns, headbands rather than long veils — there’s been a lot of birdcage veils,” said Ms. Golding, who also serves as the head millinery director at  , the London hat shop. “I have a bride I’m making an abstract tulle veil for, who is wearing a black dress from  and she’s wearing it with opera-length gloves — it’s completely out there but it will look stunning. It’s great that people are willing to step outside the bridal box.” That was exactly the thinking that led Henrietta Rix and Orlagh McCloskey, founders of the London-based label  to launch their 26-piece vintage-inspired bridal line during London Fashion Week last month. “No one was doing what we imagined a bridal line should look like and we really felt like we had the ingredients to make it work,” Ms. McCloskey said. Those ingredients include flouncy feathered hemlines, a fully sequined ivory Midi, a fringed, embroidered halter neck and a chic jumpsuit. “We want our brides to dance and have a good time and just feel amazing,” Ms. Rix added. Love was in the air elsewhere at the fall 2021 collections in London, which all took place digitally for the first time in its 35-year history. The duo behind the label   presented their show titled “I Love You” with many of their signature shirts but also a white broderie anglaise dress with horizontal pleating and billowing sleeves which had an air of structured romance about it, perfect for a relaxed, spring wedding. Over at  , which launched its own separate bridal line in 2006, there were festival-inspired looks from frilly lace pieces to bright florals offering a kaleidoscope of color that would brighten any nuptials. A shimmering gold lamé halter neck with romantic ruffled sleeves and peek-a-boo shoulders would elevate any celebration. There were more romantic offerings at  , where the Turkish-born designer prerecorded his show in the grand surroundings of the Tate Britain’s neo-Classical central hall. Showcasing a vibrant selection of organza and lace dresses, inspired by the French Revolution, many had the flouncy, decadent feel of the hit Netflix period drama “Bridgerton” or Golden Globe-nominated, “The Great.” One such creation, featured layers of frothy white tulle and lace, and came complete with a veil slash cape. The look was accessorized with long white gloves, embroidered with yellow spring flowers — perhaps signifying a new dawn both physically and metaphorically. With the recently announced plans for the   in England this month, including wedding restrictions easing gradually throughout the summer, the unwritten rules concerning bridalwear might cease to exist. For Erdem Moralioglu, who debuted his take on bridal earlier last month, alternative bridalwear has always interested him. Mr. Moralioglu, who launched his eponymous brand   in 2005, said he wanted to offer brides a more pared back aesthetic that might offer itself to multiple wears. “I think there is something wonderful about creating something that has a permanence to it,” he said. “There are pieces in the collection that you would hold onto forever.”"
You’re Not Imagining It: The Pandemic Is Making Your Hair Fall Out,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/style/hair-loss-coronavirus-pandemic.html,"With every month that passed in 2020, Samantha Hill’s part seemed to widen, the increasingly bald stripe of skin a representation of what she calls “a four-part terrible play” in her life. Reeling from the death of her father in January, Ms. Hill, a 29-year-old freelance photographer, had barely adjusted to her new normal when the pandemic hit and further upended her life. After the death of a friend in June, when her hair appeared to thin even more, she created a folder on her phone titled Hairgate, featuring every selfie she’d taken in the last four years. “I was trying to figure out where it all went wrong,” said Ms. Hill, who lives in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. It’s a quandary many people, particularly women, have agonized over in recent months, as their brushes and shower drains filled with tangles of hair. Google searches for hair loss increased by 8 percent in the last 12 months, according to the data science firm Spate, with the topic being searched an average of more than 829,000 times a month in the United States. The phenomenon is not all in our heads, according to experts, but is another frustrating byproduct of both immense stress and post-viral inflammation from Covid-19. Known as telogen effluvium in the medical world, temporary hair loss results from fever, illness and severe stress, pushing more hairs than normal into the shedding phase of the hair growth life cycle. Although hair loss tends to be associated with men because of the prevalence of male-pattern baldness, telogen effluvium is   among women, who often experience it after childbirth. “Any type of severe stress can trigger it, whether it’s stress on your body from illness or emotional stress such as the death of a loved one,” said Dr. Abigail Cline, a dermatologist at New York Medical College who has conducted research on pandemic-related hair loss. “Even though not everyone has been infected with Covid-19, we’re all living with it.” For those who have had the virus, hair loss has become a common symptom of the recovery process, usually occurring three to four months after getting sick but sometimes experienced sooner. Dr. Jerry Shapiro, a dermatologist at NYU Langone Health who specializes in hair loss, said that while a healthy head of hair usually includes 90 percent anagen, or growing, hairs and 10 percent telogen, or resting, hairs, that ratio can shift up to 50-50 after experiencing a high fever or flulike illness. For Misty Gant, a 35-year-old wellness coach living on the Lower East Side, the change happened fast. After being infected in March, Ms. Gant started losing handfuls of her long red hair in the shower and began to notice balding at her temples a few weeks after recovering. “It was really hard because my hair is important to me — it’s part of my identity,” she said, noting that before it thinned, it was her most complimented feature. Ms. Gant, who regularly dives into health and wellness research for clients, soon landed in forums full of people who had gone through similar post-Covid-19 hair loss. After doctors confirmed her suspicion that she was suffering from a post-viral inflammatory response, she readied an arsenal of holistic remedies to try to fix it. Her first point of attack was an anti-inflammatory diet that cut out sugar, gluten, dairy and alcohol and incorporated colorful fruits and vegetables, oily fish and healthy fats like avocados and nuts. She kick-started a new supplement routine of Omega 3-6-9, turmeric with fenugreek, evening primrose oil and two tablespoons of aloe juice a day, a combination she believes to be anti-inflammatory and lubricating for the skin and hair. She began giving herself daily scalp massages using  , which includes rosemary oil, an ingredient that some   have found to encourage hair growth. Two days a week she doused her hair in a mixture of coconut oil and pure rosemary oil and left it in for 24 hours. Though not a quick fix, it seemed to pay off: She now has tufts of baby hair growing in at her temples. “I try to do everything the natural way, and as a wellness practitioner, I know that things take time,” Ms. Gant said. Although it can still take months to see a significant difference, many people have had similar results from a combination of supplements, thickening shampoos and illusion-creating haircuts. After her husband noticed a few bald spots on the back of her head early in the pandemic, Martyna Szabadi, a 34-year-old business consultant who hasn’t had Covid-19, experimented with products said to promote hair growth, including various scalp scrubs, a hair serum from the Ordinary and a daily drink of flax seed water. Nothing helped until she began using   Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner and taking four capsules of   core supplement for women. “After half a year of this combination, I finally have the hair issue under control,” Ms. Szabadi said. Nutrafol supplements also seemed to help Ms. Hill get her hair back on track after she began taking them in July, leaving her with a slimmer part and new hair growth around the crown. It was a boom year for the company, with revenue increasing 60 percent in 2020 compared to 2019, according to Giorgos Tsetis, the chief executive and a founder of the company. Mr. Tsetis said that 80 percent of the company’s sales increase can be attributed to its two core formulas for women: Nutrafol Women and Women’s Balance. They include ingredients like vitamin A, vitamin D, zinc and biotin, the last of which has become widely known as a hair growth supplement despite the fact that dermatologists disagree over its efficacy. “No one’s really been able to prove it helps hair in a randomized controlled study, and they’ve had a long time to prove it,” Dr. Shapiro said. But with wellness ruling the day, Nutrafol’s chemical-free, made-from-the-earth virtue has made it a popular option. Nutrafol bills itself as a “natural, holistic” alternative to old-school remedies like Rogaine, or minoxidil, which is a topical solution used to improve blood flow and stimulate hair growth. Another treatment option is platelet rich plasma therapy, known as P.R.P., which involves the injection of a patient’s own blood into the scalp to stimulate hair growth. Priced between $500 and $1,800, P.R.P. doesn’t work for everyone and is best done alongside other treatments, according to Dr. Shapiro, who believes it’s a better fit for people experiencing female or male-pattern baldness, which has a genetic cause. If waiting three months for a shampoo or supplement to kick in doesn’t thrill you, consider a haircut that will make your hair look healthier than it is. Justine Marjan, a hairstylist whose clients include Kardashians and the model Ashley Graham, recommends a shorter, blunt cut to create an illusion of thickness. “It’s best to avoid longer looks, as the hair can end up looking weak and frail at the ends,” Ms. Marjan said. If your hair loss is most noticeable at your hairline or part, she suggests using an eye shadow or root touch-up spray that matches your hair color to create depth and the appearance of fullness. Using headband-style extensions that you can easily pop on and off without damaging the hair is another favorite trick. Most important, be gentle and strategic with your hair. Ms. Marjan recommends drying fragile hair with a soft microfiber towel and using a tool like the Tangle Teezer to prevent breakage. Sleeping on a silk pillowcase is also believed to minimize breakage. And, while many people resort to ponytails when their hair is limp, it’s best to avoid tight styling that could pull out more hair. What’s definitely not great for hair growth? Constant panic. “Stressing about it will only cause more hair loss,” Dr. Cline said, noting that a deep, six-month-long breath is a better prescription. “I reassure patients with telogen effluvium that their hair will grow back, but it’s going to take time.”"
"Shed Your Quarantine Skin (and Hair and Nails), Safely",style,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/at-home/coronavirus-salons.html,"As areas around the country reopen following months of lockdowns, people are emerging from their homes with shaggy hair, translucent skin and claw-like fingernails — and then rushing to make self-care appointments. “The bathhouse has been booked out every day that we’ve been open,” said Andrew Nehlig, the owner of Sauna House, in Asheville, N.C., which reopened last month. You might be overdue for some general maintenance, or perhaps you need to undo some   quarantine beauty treatments that went awry. Or you might want to catch up with your stylist or technician. “There’s sort of a shrink relationship,” said Jane Hong, the chief executive of the Manhattan nail salon and retailer Paintbox. “This is why we’re here on earth, not to live in isolation but to help one another, support one another and speak to one another.” Perhaps your look affirms your very sense of self: Khane Kutzwell, whose Brooklyn barber shop, Camera Ready Kutz,   serves the L.G.B.T.Q. community, noted that hair styling “is a super-duper big thing” for some of her queer and transgender clients. Should you decide to venture out, you may be wondering how to stay safer during a haircut, wax or manicure. “It’s reducing the risk, not eliminating the risk,” said Wafaa El-Sadr, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “Nobody can tell you it’s safe to do x, y and z. We can make x, y and z as safe as possible.” Local safety guidelines, as well as measures adopted by salons and spas, can help mitigate your chance of contracting or spreading Covid-19. In some cities, certain services, like facials and facial waxing, are  . Communal facilities — like steam rooms, saunas and baths — might be  , or their capacities dramatically reduced. Plexiglass   may separate you from the receptionist, people in neighboring chairs and even your manicurist; ventilation systems may pump filtered air into the room. The amenities you’re used to — a cup of tea or snacks — may have disappeared. There will be cleaning supplies everywhere. (“We could kill pretty much anything that lives,” said Gabrielle Ophals, a co-founder of the Manhattan spa Haven.) And everyone will be wearing a mask. The first thing to ask yourself, according to Celine Gounder, an infectious disease expert and former assistant health commissioner for New York City, is whether there’s still widespread community transmission in your area. If there is, she said, “then I think as with anything, whether it’s school reopenings or nonessential services — and to me, this is a nonessential service — those need to be shut down until you can get your community transmission under control.” Some areas that forged ahead with reopenings   pausing or even rolling back those plans; in Los Angeles County, personal care facilities that began operating again in mid-June are   limited to treating clients outdoors. If a treatment is available to you, reflect on how essential it is, and how much you’ll be exposing yourself if you receive it. “Step back one step and think, ‘Do I need to do this or do I want to do it?’” Dr. El-Sadr said. When it comes to assessing the relative risk of different appointments, she explained, there are two primary variables: the duration of your treatment and your distance from the person providing your service. Time can vary widely (think of a polish change compared with a full Mani-Pedi), and you should try to limit the length of your appointment, but one thing is constant: It’s nearly impossible to maintain a six-foot distance. Consider, too, how many other people will be in the room; a private therapy is inevitably safer than one that places you in a room with several other people. The risk also increases for you — and the person providing your service — if you have to remove your mask or they have to touch your face. So you should forego lip and eyebrow waxes or threading, facials and professional makeup artistry. And Shari Lipner, a dermatologist at Weill-Cornell Medical Center who specializes in nail disorders, recommends skipping the cuticle trim that usually accompanies a manicure, since cuticles help seal off the nail beds from microorganisms. In the past, you may have dipped out during your lunch break for a manicure or bikini wax, but, these days, there’s comfort to be found in planning ahead. Plus, some salons and spas aren’t yet taking walk-in clients and will turn you away unless they have a stylist, technician or massage therapist available at that exact moment. Before the pandemic, Sauna House’s clientele primarily consisted of walk-ins; now, it operates entirely by appointment. “We created a whole new business,” Mr. Nehlig said. He reduced the capacity of the bathhouse from 28 people to eight, established a time limit inside and increased the time between massage appointments from 15 minutes to 30 minutes. These measures help maintain social distancing and allow a buffer period for sanitizing. As a result, bookings are both more necessary — and harder to come by. You can also find out if the facility takes private appointments, or whether your stylist is making house calls. Start by checking the salon’s or spa’s website, which may outline its rules and regulations. This makes the process safer and more seamless, and reduces frustration on both ends. Plan for the waiting room to be closed, and some   might be restricted to employee use, so think twice about guzzling a liter of water before you arrive. If you have questions, reach out by phone or email to clarify the procedures. Dr. El-Sadr recommends making sure that the shop is operating at a reduced capacity, with ample space among chairs, and that everyone is wearing a mask. You may also be asked to complete a health screening online or over the phone before your visit and to have your temperature taken upon arrival. “The most important thing is, if you have any symptoms, don’t go,” Dr. Gounder said. “Be honest about it.” Some businesses have waived cancellation fees to encourage you to stay home if you feel the slightest bit under the weather. Carry hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes. Some nail salons   that you bring your own tools, if you have them — a practice that Dr. Lipner also suggests. (Discard or sanitize them after your manicure.) Most of all, don’t forget your  , and consider bringing an extra in case it gets wet or dirty during the course of your treatment. If you’re going for a haircut, ensure you have a well-fitting mask that goes behind your ears, rather than around the back of your head. Wearing a mask is, as Dr. Gounder put it, “the No. 1, 2 and 3 most important thing that a client can be doing” to reduce the risk of contracting or spreading Covid-19. A   by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention underscored this: In Springfield, Mo., two hair stylists continued coming to work, days after they began to feel sick. Together, they exposed 139 people to the virus — none of whom reported symptoms in the two weeks after. Around 98 percent of the clients interviewed by the C.D.C. said they were wearing a mask during their appointments. Stylists, barbers, estheticians and other personal care professionals are on the front lines of the pandemic. They work face-to-face with — and, often, within a couple inches of — their clients. “The vast majority of people working in these industries are women, and many of them women of color,” Dr. Gounder said. (Her new podcast, “Epidemic,” recently aired an episode on the effect of the pandemic among beauty professionals.) “So that definitely contributes to exacerbation of the disparities we’ve seen in terms of who’s affected by Covid.” The economic toll of the coronavirus shutdowns has been especially steep among the small businesses that closed from March into June and July. So as shops reopen, don’t be surprised to see higher prices, and be prepared to tip to excess. As everyone gets accustomed to this new normal, try compassion. (“We’re nervous, too!” read the website of one Austin nail salon before reopening in June.) And if you remain uncomfortable with going out for the sake of your hair, nails or skin, there are other ways to support your friends in the beauty industry. Shoot them a Venmo or buy a gift card for a future appointment — and  ."
Self-Care for Black Journalists,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/style/self-care/black-journalists.html,"Heat flushed Natelegé Whaley’s body as she wrote a news article about the shooting by police that  . Ms. Whaley, a journalist, figured she was tired. Then came the mental fog, digestive issues and blurred vision. When these seemingly separate issues snowballed into a panic attack and a trip to the emergency room in late May, Ms. Whaley, 31, who lives in Brooklyn, connected the dots. “I’m writing about the suffering of someone who looks like me,” she said. “We just keep going and going and going and going because we feel like that’s what we must do, and that’s not healthy.” The news today is filled with grief, especially for Black journalists reporting on violence against Black people, socioeconomic disparities underscored by the coronavirus pandemic and racism in the workplace. The situation is complicated by the fact that often they are doing this work for publications where most of the staff is white. “Black journalists, like nurses or psychotherapists or anyone else who regularly hears or views trauma narratives, may experience vicarious trauma, or distress that stems from repeated exposure to the trauma of others,” said Robin D. Stone, a licensed mental health counselor specializing in trauma-informed treatment. “They may feel especially vulnerable that the person on the respirator or in the violent video could be them or someone they love.” (Ms. Stone knows the world of reporting intimately: For more than 20 years, she was a journalist, including a stint at The New York Times.) The conditions can be particularly challenging for freelancers, who cannot rely on a biweekly paycheck or corporate health insurance, Ms. Whaley said. “Even though you’re getting paid, it really puts us in a vulnerable position while the company profits off the work that requires immense emotional and mental labor,” she said. “Yes, the stories need to be told. But no one is really thinking about whether Black freelancers have the resources they need to stay sane during this time.” Black Americans are underrepresented in American newsrooms; a Pew Research Center survey of data from 2013 to 2017 found that only 7 percent of newsroom employees are Black. (At The New York Times, 9 percent of newsroom employees are Black.) Often Black journalists are called upon to report and write specifically about issues within their own community, which may involve viewing imagery that depicts violence, hatred and death. Many of them have  about the importance of prioritizing mental health care and wellness. In the absence of employer-sponsored insurance and mental health services for freelancers, and in light of recent discussions on workplace burnout, many Black journalists are rethinking the work that is required to report on atrocities in Black communities. “I feel like we’re still figuring it out,” Ms. Whaley said. “We’re just starting to have these open conversations about mental health because in the past Black journalists were just supposed to be happy just to be in this space, especially if you have a job at a major publication. It’s like everyone thinks that you’ve made it.” Inundated with a nonstop stream of race-related news, today’s Black journalists are adopting a mix of traditional and informal practices to better care for and protect their own mental health and wellness. “All Black Americans have some degree of PTSD,” said Dr. Monnica Williams, a clinical psychologist and expert in race-based stress and trauma. In the case of Black journalists, Dr. Williams referred to studies of being “repeatedly exposed to details of traumatic experiences in your line of work.” “Being a journalist is not any different because you’re being constantly exposed to these gruesome details of horrific instances of racism,” she said. “So it’s just the same.” To better manage on a day-to-day basis, Dr. Williams recommended a “toolbox of coping strategies” that includes seeking social support within one’s communities, briefly limiting one’s exposure to cues of racism, engaging with religious or spiritual practices, seeking distraction from cues of racism, and participating in restful and relaxing activities. And how does one determine if and when they should take a break? Dr. Williams pointed to several examples of racial stress and trauma interfering with one’s daily functions, like being depressed or anxious for most of the day, or having trouble sleeping. “When you see it affecting your quality of life, that’s a pretty good sign you should write stories about puppies or something,” she said. But sometimes taking a break from writing means cutting off one’s main source of income, especially without the support of paid sick days or paid time off. Ms. Whaley proposed offering Black journalists fully-funded sabbaticals every to rest, recover and reset: “That would be a real reparation to me because we need it.” “I want all Black journalists to know you deserve so much better,” she continued. “And I deserved better than what I gave myself and what this industry has given me.” Julia Craven, 27, a reporter for Slate in Washington, D.C., has been reporting exclusively on racism since graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2014. Two years into her career, the news cycle flooded with reports of hate crimes and white supremacist ideologies, fueled in part by the 2016 presidential election. There were also numerous stories of Black individuals who had been killed in police custody. Ms. Craven felt she could barely tread water. In each killed person, she would catch a glimpse of her loved ones: her brother, her boyfriend, her best friend, her sister and sometimes even herself. “Everything seemed like it was constantly happening, so I went back into therapy,” Ms. Craven said. “I knew that I needed to develop some sort of self care system because if my mental health ain’t on point, then I can’t do my job.” More recently, at her therapist’s suggestion, Ms. Craven has made a concerted effort to limit her exposure to the news on the weekends. The move has given her the space and time to focus on herself on days off and be more present when she is at work, particularly at a demanding time. Dr. Williams said she frequently advises her Black clients, friends and even acquaintances to unplug from social media to recover from stress and recommends they not watch videos of Black people being harmed. “I don’t think journalists need to see these videos unless your job is to write a detailed account of how the person died, second by second,” she said. But therapy and an escape from the news is a luxury to many, especially uninsured and freelance journalists, like Ms. Whaley. She said she tried seeing a therapist, but her funds were limited given her uneven employment and the cost of an in-network therapist through her health insurance. “I couldn’t afford the therapy because I’m a freelancer and not a full-time staff writer with benefits,” she said. “But then I need to go to therapy to help cope with my freelance career.” After Ms. Whaley’s panic attack, though, she pulled back from an assignment for her own well-being, and an editor sent her a link to the  . Sonia Weiser, 28, a white freelance writer based in Manhattan, started the relief fund through a GoFundMe page after witnessing an outpouring of   for Black writers to cover racial violence, as well as the protests galvanized by the killing of George Floyd, often for relatively little compensation. “It just felt rude and disrespectful to put the onus on Black journalists, especially when so much of the trauma incurred in the industry is because of white employers,” she said. After she created the fund, people donated to meet the $20,000 goal and raised $32,000 within 48 hours. Ms. Weiser has since raised over $70,000, and has   with the International Women’s Media Foundation for additional support. They have provided microgrants to 84 applicants (the majority of whom don’t have health insurance that covers mental health expenses), matching nearly every person’s desired amount up to $2,000. As one of the fund recipients, Ms. Whaley has received enough money to see a therapist — a Black woman, which was Ms. Whaley’s preference — twice a week for the next four to six months. (She sought more affordable psychotherapy sessions through Open Path Collective, a nonprofit organization providing affordable, in-office and online psychotherapy services ranging from $30 to $80 per session.) “I was able to take a deep breath after that,” Ms. Whaley said. While Ms. Stone recommends a therapist if trauma or stress-related symptoms are interfering with a person’s work or home life, she said she also encourages Black journalists to cultivate a world outside of work and to seek support through communities of peers with whom they can share their experiences and find common ground and validation. Clydeen McDonald, 33, a freelance journalist from Trinidad and Tobago, said he had been despondent over his work, especially after two high-profile, historically white-staffed national publications passed on his pitches about coronavirus-related news in the Caribbean region. “Sometimes I find myself thinking, ‘Did I get rejected because it was not the right pitch or not professional enough?’” he said. As a journalist, Mr. McDonald said he feels pressure to make sure people from his home country and other Caribbean nations see themselves in timely, in-depth news beyond hurricane coverage. Otherwise, he has not done his job, he said. To alleviate stress, Mr. McDonald, who has been living most recently in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, has weekly phone conversations with his mother and younger sister — or as Dr. Williams put it, he has found social support within his own community of friends and family. Nsikan Akpan, 34, a science editor at National Geographic in Washington, D.C., unwinds by going on physically demanding bike rides and speaking with his fiancé, his friends from college and other loved ones, as well as self-prescribing a sort of musical therapy that involves listening to throwback Kanye West albums for the sake of nostalgia. “Something about some of the tracks on his early albums just really speak to me,” Mr. Akpan said. The song “Hey Mama,” a tribute to Mr. West’s mother from his 2005 album “Late Registration,” is one he has listened to repeatedly. “I think that really stuck out to me, especially because George Floyd was calling out for his mom at the end, and my dad died last year so my mom and I got closer through that,” he said. “I’ve definitely been thinking about her a lot.” Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff, 27, the head of editorial at  , a British publication that centers perspectives of women and nonbinary people of color, said for a while, she chose to prioritize her work “ahead of personal concerns.” She noticed her stress levels were at an all-time high, underscored by a monthlong eye twitch. She felt anguish about her decision, recently, to take a week off. “We’ve been doing this work, this anti-racist kind of reporting, for years now,” she said. “I’ve never seen this level of interest in what we do and how we do it. It’s been intense. It’s been very draining. This period of time and this increased level of interest won’t last, and I kind of want to make the most out of it while people care.”"
Embrace the Blush,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/style/skin-care-makeup-embrace-the-blush.html,"It may be a surprise to learn that blush, a makeup item long associated with 1980s-style glamour, is poised to make a major comeback. While lipstick or contour can’t be seen under our masks, and wearing lots of eye makeup feels like too much of a dedicated effort, blush is becoming the hero bit of makeup that can add an instant pop of color to the face. Blush sales and searches appear to be increasing at a time when other makeup categories are not. According to new research from the data provider Semrush, blush is the third-most searched beauty product in the United States, and the data science team at Pattern, an e-commerce partner, has reported a rise in demand for blush. Adding face color is fun, after all. “Too much time inside, without the inspiration of others and the opportunity to decorate our faces, makes it all the more fun when we can,” said  , a makeup artist. She recently did  around the eyes of the actress Nicola Coughlan, who stars in the Shondaland period romp “Bridgerton.” Here, then, are some new ways to wear blush — how to choose the right color, how to apply it, and more — in the age of wearing a mask. When used strategically, blush can infuse warmth into any complexion, a much-needed boost when you’ve been indoors for months. “You can add instant brightness by adding touches of corals and pinks,” Ms. Barnes said. To warm up a complexion, she suggests applying it in a soft circular shape over the apples of your cheeks. “If a complexion doesn’t have enough life, there are so many ways to wear it,” said  , a makeup artist who works with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. One of Ms. Hughes’s favorite techniques is to go for a “super-blushy look,” making it the focus of your entire makeup look. With mask wearing, blush has moved up, above the mask line, closer to the eyes and on the tops of cheekbones. “The old way that I used to do it has become new again,” said the makeup artist Sandy Linter, who wrote the book “Disco Beauty” and did makeup for Diana Ross, Jerry Hall and Jackie O. “It’s high up on the cheekbone, and then it swings into like a C shape into the temples. Make sure you blend it, so it doesn’t look that obvious.” Ms. Barnes has also been using maximum blush and taking inspiration from the ’70s and ’80s, extending color over the eye socket and sweeping it up toward the temples. “You can use the same shade over your entire lid or wash the blush over your usual eye shadow, either way works,” she said. Ms. Hughes has been taking an equally retro approach, sweeping blush over the eyes and brow instead of doing a complicated eye makeup look. “I think of it like a soft little accent in an ’80s kind of way, all the way up into the eye and the brow,” she said. Another modern touch for those who aren’t blush averse: Choose your blush and coordinate the rest of your makeup look to it. “Pick whatever your color is, and make the blush and everything else match,” said Ms. Hughes, who recently experimented with a bright pink  . “Then just do loads of lashes. It’s so chic and simple but impactful because it’s harmonious.” The great thing about blush is that choosing the right color isn’t hard, and the new style of blush favors the bold.  , another makeup artist, said that there are no rules when it comes to color, and she works with   or   when applying blush over the apples of the cheeks and up into the eye sockets. “You can use any color,” Ms. Hsu said. She is also a fan of using draping techniques, taking deeper pinks and reds  and over the cheeks. “It’s fun to play with several shades and textures of pink to make a monochromatic look more exciting and to add a bit of depth,” she said. Other makeup artists like to mix multiple colors to get a custom look. “Enhance your bone structure by using a tone a couple of shades darker than your skin tone, mixed with a nude hue,” Ms. Barnes said. Today’s blushes come in many textures — cream, powder, liquid. When wearing a mask, a liquid tint that dries down is the most transfer-proof option. But you can also use blush to change the texture of your complexion overall. “Cream is great for dry skin,” Ms. Barnes said. “And powder for oily skin as a rule, but it’s personal preference. Natural makeup works well with creams, but with powder you can be more direct on where you place it, and it tends to last longer.” Ms. Linter prefers to play with multiple textures. “You can wear both textures at once and layer,” she said. But the tool is just as important as the texture you choose. Opt for a sponge when using creams; fingers work fine with liquids; and use a brush for powders. “Brushes are very, very important,” she said. “Some big, soft brushes are very ineffective. They don’t do anything. For blush, you need to have a pretty full-sized brush, but it needs to be a little on the firm side so that when you hit your skin, it controls the powder and keeps it so you can spread it correctly in the right place.” Blending is the key to making blush modern, but not so much that you overdo it and lose the color. “If I’m watching people put makeup on and they’re not fans of blush, I can always tell because they’ll apply it and then ferociously rub it in,” Ms. Hughes said. “What ends up happening is they rub it off as they’re blending it in. Just pick up a tiny bit, apply it slowly. You shouldn’t see the payoff immediately. You should see it gradually.” At the end of the day, however, Ms. Hughes cautions that there are really no strict rules with blush. “If you like an actual cheek moment, do it,” she said. “If you like a high-up-into-the-temples moment, you should do that. Experiment to see what you like.”"
,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/style/emily-bode-sweetheart-t-shirt.html,"DESIGNER D.I.Y. SERIES The latest installment of our Designer D.I.Y. at Home series teaches you how to whip up a present for the significant other you may not have seen for a while. The environmentalist precept of “reduce, reuse, recycle” is an aesthetic touchstone for the designer Emily Bode, isolating since mid-March in British Columbia. Since graduating from Parsons a few years ago, she has established herself as a maverick presence on the men’s wear scene, her quirky designs attracting the attention of awards committees as well as a passionate fan base. The notion of repurposing whatever is at hand was thus no challenge for Ms. Bode, who often makes clothes from vintage and scavenged materials of all sorts, including French mattress ticking, quilts, embroidered tablecloths and even old pennies. For this project, she proposed making a “sweetheart” T-shirt as a present for that significant other you may not have seen IRL for some time. “There’s no experience in sewing necessary,” Ms. Bode said. “The more homemade and messy, the better.” STEP 1 Choose thread colors that contrast with the T-shirt. “This is a great time to use all of the pre-threaded needles from those miniature hotel mending kits,” Ms. Bode said. STEP 2 Sew a simple loose running stitch along the edges of the cuffs, collar and hem of the T-shirt. Repeat as many times as you like, using different colors, and feel free to experiment with harder stitches like a whipstitch or a zigzag, if you’re undaunted by those. Stitch loosely so the shirt can stretch over your head and body. Tie the thread ends to your last stitch so the knot does not pull through the knit of the shirt. STEP 3 Very lightly, with your pencil, outline a large heart on the front of the T-shirt. “I like to draw an arrow through the heart,” she said. STEP 4 Using the same running stitch, trace the heart with the needle and thread. STEP 5 Again, very lightly with a pencil, write your chosen initials or name diagonally inside the heart. Stitch the initials as in Step 4. STEP 6 Wash your T-shirt to erase pencil marks. Photograph by Karsten Moran for The New York Times"

SERIES In the latest installment of our Designer D.I.Y. at Home series, Hillary Taymour, the creative director of Collina Strada, offers a creative use for excess beets. Sustainability may be fashion’s favorite buzzword, but Hillary Taymour, the designer behind Collina Strada, doesn’t just pay lip service to the concept; she brings it down to earth, treating sustainability like something everyone can practice every day. Like by dyeing a white T-shirt using beets and turmeric. “I look at tie-dye as a form of hand-painting on clothes,” Ms. Taymour said. “There’s no way to make exact replica tie-dyes.” She has been using tie-dye in her collections since 2018, sometimes with three to six different techniques in one garment, elevating the summer camp pastime into an artisanal practice. Here, she demonstrates one technique: the subtle plaid tie-dye. STEP 1 Prepare two pots of boiling water. Cut up the beets and place in one pot, allowing them to boil for one hour. Add a splash of the vinegar. This will help your dye hold pigment. Pour the turmeric into the second pot and boil for eight minutes. When both dyes are done, pour them into two bowls (or similar large containers). STEP 2 Lay the shirt on a flat surface. Pinch the fabric between the neck and shoulder seam of the T-shirt. Carefully drag it toward the middle of the shirt, creating a vertical fold down the centerline of the shirt. Fold the sleeve inward, too, aligning its edge with the far end of the fold that you just made. Repeat on the other side of the shirt. You should have one long column. STEP 3 Pick up the shirt and carefully fold it vertically down the centerline, outward or away from you. (You’re folding one of the long halves behind the other, making your column thinner by half.) Lay the column flat, and imagine it was horizontally broken up into four pieces. You’ll be piling the four quarters on top of one another, but alternating the direction of the folds. You can start by folding the bottom quarter upward. Then take that two-layer stack and fold it underneath the next quarter of the shirt. Continue alternating folds until the shirt looks like a thick rectangle. STEP 4 With the rectangle vertical, wrap two rubber bands around the shirt horizontally so that the shirt is split into three segments. STEP 5 Using a spoon, start dropping turmeric dye into the center of the shirt. Leave the edges white. Make sure the dye saturates through all of the layers, spooning the turmeric in between each fold. Now pick up the bundle and dip the white edges into the beet dye, counting to 15 seconds, and repeating on all four sides. Essentially your rectangle should have a yellow center with a pink frame. STEP 6 Open it up and lay it flat to dry overnight. (Don’t hang it up!) It’ll be ready for you to wear the next morning. Photograph by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images"
Essential Oils May Be Wreaking Havoc on Your Skin,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/style/self-care-essential-oils-may-be-wreaking-havoc-on-your-skin.html,"When Kristen Fanarakis emerged from a facial at an all-natural salon in Atlanta, her face did not have the fresh, glossy glow she had hoped for. “My face was basically falling off,” she said, noting that the result was closer to what happens after a Fraxel laser treatment, which can leaves patients with red, shedding skin for days. “I looked Frankenstein-ish.” It wasn’t a normal reaction for Ms. Fanarakis, the 44-year-old founder of a clothing brand. She has what she describes as “strong Greek skin” that can withstand regular chemical peels and ample retinol usage. What her skin apparently couldn’t withstand was the papaya and pumpkin essential oils used during the facial. “Skin care is a science, so assuming that something ‘natural’ is better is risky,” she said. “There are plenty of compounds out in nature that are bad for us.” That sentiment is growing amid an unregulated “clean” beauty boom in which many new brands position themselves as better for skin simply on the basis of their natural, nontoxic ingredients. Essential oils, often added to products for fragrance or for their antibacterial properties, have become particularly controversial as they’ve grown in popularity, with companies like   raking in   on sales of the oils. Dermatologists have long argued that essential oils are risky for skin, but customers are starting to catch on in the wake of unexpected and sometimes painful skin reactions. Last March, an   on the satirical website  , titled “Essential Oils to Cure Your Rash From That Other Essential Oil,” offered a succinct summary of the backlash. Dr. Annie Gonzalez, a dermatologist in Miami, has seen an uptick in essential oil reactions, calling them one of the leading causes of allergic contact dermatitis. The situation has worsened during the pandemic, she said, because people are experimenting with essential oil remedies while stuck at home. “It’s becoming more problematic because people are using undiluted forms of these oils to make their own product,” Dr. Gonzalez said. Lab-prepared products, however, can be just as problematic. Last February, Gabrielle Puig, a 21-year-old student at George Washington University, decided to test out the Jet Lag mask from Summer Fridays, a much-hyped skin-care brand from the influencer Marianna Hewitt, to soothe her dry skin. Minutes after application, her face started stinging and tingling in a way that seemed counterproductive. “I immediately took it off, and my skin was more red and irritated than ever before,” Ms. Puig said. After reviewing the ingredient list, she became convinced that the peppermint and citrus oils were the culprits. In January, Summer Fridays posted an   to customers after receiving a slew of negative reviews that mentioned rashes and hives as side effects. While the brand attributed the reactions to a product batch being compromised by a third-party manufacturer, it noted that it would be working to remove essential oils from its products “to mitigate any future potential for irritation.” To understand why essential oils can be risky for skin, it helps to understand what they are and are not. Extracted from flowers, bark, stems, leaves, roots and select fruits via either distillation or cold-pressing, essential oils are highly concentrated chemical components that contain a plant’s essence or smell. “They require a high amount of plant material for processing, so they usually have much higher active ingredient concentrations than we’re used to,” said David Petrillo, a cosmetic chemist in Los Angeles. They are much more concentrated than popular oils like coconut and argan, for instance, which are considered “carrier” oils that are milder and are often used to dilute stronger essential oils. While inhaling certain essential oils has been   the central nervous system and stimulate the brain to release neurotransmitters like serotonin that help with mood regulation, they’ve also been shown to  . When it comes to the skin, some experts say that in small concentrations they offer antibacterial benefits, but many believe that beyond giving a product a nice scent, they do more harm than good. “Using them on your skin almost insures that some of it will get into your bloodstream,” Dr. Petrillo said, listing a skin-crawling list of common side effects, including redness, chemical burns, headaches, swelling and blisters. And although many brands maintain that the antibacterial properties of essential oils aid in fighting acne, they can actually worsen breakouts. “A lot of our clients with acne are using ‘cleaner’ skin-care brands that can actually clog pores because of the oils and botanicals they’re formulated with,” said Sofie Pavitt, an aesthetician in New York. Although it’s possible to experience an allergic reaction to any essential oil, some are known to be riskier than others. Citrus oils, including lemon, orange and bergamot, are particularly dangerous, as they can be phototoxic, meaning they react to UV light and can cause skin to burn and blister. Cinnamon bark, clove, lemongrass, oregano, peppermint and jasmine oils are also known to cause irritation. But the essential oil that most commonly wreaks havoc is also one of the most recommended by naturopaths and natural skin-care enthusiasts. “Tea tree oil wins the prize,” Dr. Gonzalez said. “I see so many patients with acne or fungus who are convinced that tea tree oil is a miracle remedy for pretty much everything.” Using too much undiluted tea tree oil purchased at the drugstore for face masks, or for spot treatments, patients end up worsening their skin condition and develop tinea incognito, a fungal infection that’s masked and often exacerbated by the application of a topical agent. “It makes it even harder for me to diagnose the primary issue, and it becomes more complicated to fix because you now have to repair the skin barrier that has been compromised by the use of these oils,” Dr. Gonzalez said. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to essential oils, and blacklisting them from your routine doesn’t have to be the answer. “Most of what we use in the beauty industry is really in that gray zone, where some people can use it without a problem and other people can’t,” Dr. Gonzalez said. “I always tell patients that it really depends on the dosage, the concentration and the source.” Experts recommend looking for diluted concentrations of 0.5 to 1 percent or lower, preferably mixed with a less reactive carrier oil like argan or coconut. Since many brands don’t list concentrations, a simple smell test will do: If it’s very fragrant, it’s more likely to irritate your skin. Your safest bet, Dr. Gonzalez said, is to do a patch test on the inside of your arm and let it sit, unwashed, for 48 hours to see how your skin reacts. People with underlying skin conditions like psoriasis, rosacea or eczema should be particularly cautious. If you happen to fall in the sensitive camp but still want to experiment with “clean” beauty, a growing number of products explicitly avoid essential oils.   lists them in its   ingredients to be wary of and keeps them out of its products. , a veteran brand in the clean beauty space, sells an   created in partnership with the San Francisco facialist Kristina Holey. And the skin-care line   was created by Johanna Peet specifically to address the lack of clean options for sensitive skin, the line positioned as the high-design version of the gentle drugstore stalwarts Cetaphil and CeraVe. While a soothing line without fragrance isn’t a sexy sell, consumers (particularly Gen Z) are getting savvier about ingredients and the risks involved in the products they use. “The idea that, just because something is natural it’s not necessarily better for your skin, is gaining more traction,” Ms. Peet said. “But as with many things in the beauty industry, it needs to be repeated many times before people fully get the message.”"
This Is Your Skin on Stress,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/fashion/this-is-your-skin-on-stress.html,"It starts in utero. A mass of cells divides and develops, splits and stretches, and from a single layer of embryonic tissue, two seemingly separate but inherently interconnected systems are born: the brain and the skin. They are bound for life. When one senses embarrassment, the other blushes. When one senses pain, the other processes it. And when one bears the burden of a pandemic, political unrest, systemic racism and the ever worsening effects of climate change … well, the other gets a pimple. Or perhaps, depending on your genetic predispositions, it’s not a pimple but an eczema outbreak. A psoriasis flare-up. A bout of rosacea. A dehydrated, dull, oily or even — gasp — older-looking appearance. General blah ness, if you will. This is your skin on stress. “There are two different types of stress: acute stress and chronic stress,” said Dr. Whitney Bowe, a dermatologist and the author of “ .” A quick surge of stress can be a good thing. It may heighten your senses, enhance mental clarity and help create collagen to facilitate wound repair. It’s there and it’s gone. It’s the chronic, continuing stress, the kind that every sentient being is likely experiencing right now, that takes a toll on the skin. It takes a toll on the entire being, of course, and a compromised complexion is the least of its consequences. But “the skin is the organ that we see,” as Dr. Loretta Ciraldo, a dermatologist and founder of the  skin-care line, put it. And in a society where unsustainable stress is not only the norm, but sometimes a celebrated sign of success, what better way for the subconscious to cry out than “stress skin”? (It is, after all, easier to   than your face.) Much of the skin-psyche connection comes down to the overproduction of cortisol, the primary stress hormone, and its effect on  . “The barrier traps moisture in and keeps allergens, irritants and pollutants out,” Dr. Bowe said. It effectively does the job of most skin-care products on the market,   products, and needs three things in order to thrive: oil, water and the microbiome. Cortisol depletes them all. During times of stress, cortisol slows the production of beneficial oils. “We get dry, rough and much more irritated because those healthy oils act as a protective layer for us,” Dr. Ciraldo said. Without adequate lipids to seal in hydration, the skin starts to “leak” water in a process known as transepidermal water loss (TEWL). At the same time, cortisol stimulates the overproduction of sebum, the oil that is implicated in acne. “So for many of us, our skin seems more oily when we’re under stress, and it’s more acne prone,” she said. All of this alters the skin’s pH, which compromises   and creates an inhospitable environment for the one trillion symbiotic micro-organisms that exist on and in the skin barrier — a.k.a., the microbiome. Under ideal conditions, the microbiome renders topical skin care all but superfluous. There are microbes that feed off sebum, which helps sustain healthy oil levels. There are microbes that feed off dead skin cells — the original exfoliators! There are microbes that produce peptides and ceramides, two buzzed-about beauty ingredients that keep skin firm and moisturized. There are microbes that offer protection from pollution, sunlight and invading pathogens. “If you’re not producing enough of those healthy fats and not maintaining a healthy barrier, though, you’re altering the terrain on which these microbes grow and thrive,” Dr. Bowe said. “Imagine stripping the soil of all the nutrients and seeing if your vegetable garden is going to grow. It’s the same for the skin.” In turn, the microbiome may experience an overgrowth of so-called bad bacteria (like  acnes, the strain associated with acne) and a dearth of good bacteria. The microbiome becomes more prone to infection, irritation, inflammation and hyperpigmentation. It becomes more sensitive to outside aggressors, like the free radicals generated by pollution. Stress prompts the body to produce internal free radicals, as well. “You can think of free radicals like little missiles,” Dr. Bowe said, in that they target cells for destruction and cause oxidative stress. When free radicals target DNA, it leads to skin cancer. When free radicals target elastin and collagen, it leads to fine lines and wrinkles. When free radicals target lipids, it leads to dehydration and skin barrier damage and . Chronic exposure to cortisol also inhibits the production of hyaluronic acid and collagen. “These are what keep the skin plump and youthful,” Dr. Bowe said. “When you can’t make enough, the skin gets thinner.” Sadly, hyaluronic acid serums and collagen creams can’t counteract cortisol. Topical ingredients don’t serve the same biological purpose as those produced in the body and rarely penetrate to the lower layer of the dermis, where collagen and hyaluronic acid naturally occur. In fact, skin-care products aren’t the answer to stress skin at all. “Most products are meant for consumers who have a healthy skin barrier,” said Ron Robinson, a cosmetic chemist and founder of  . Exposing an already broken barrier to active ingredients — or too many ingredients — only exacerbates existing issues. For this reason, Dr. Ciraldo recommends removing barrier-degrading ingredients like glycolic acid, salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide and retinol from your stress skin routine. “They are very drying, and they really do deplete the normal, healthy barrier function,” she said. Dr. Bowe advises that you avoid any leave-on products with essential oils in them, because they can cause irritation. “A lot of people think they’re calming and soothing, but for the skin, that’s not the case,” she said. Exceptions can be made for barrier-boosting ingredients, like glycolipids (found in  ), fatty acids (found in  ) and ceramides (found in  ). Managing stress may seem nearly impossible, considering that so many modern stressors are systemic. Yet according to Dr. Heather Woolery-Lloyd, a dermatologist, “90 percent of our stress is not the stressor itself, but how we deal with that stressor.” In other words: While meditation can’t mitigate global warming, it can, at the very least, clear your complexion. Meditating, Dr. Woolery-Lloyd said, initiates “ ” which activates the body’s parasympathetic nervous system and decreases cortisol and inflammation. With consistent practice, the skin barrier can stop leaking and start locking in moisture, suggesting that the fabled inner glow is less symbolic than scientific. Dr. Ciraldo tells her patients to think of meditation as “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up” for the mind. “Try to find a spot when you’re going to sit quietly for 20 minutes a day and really go through your thoughts like you would your closet,” she said. “If something comes into your mind that doesn’t give you joy, put energy into discarding that thought.” Not into meditation? No matter. Breathing, which may beat drinking water as the most eye-rollingly simple yet undeniably effective skin-care tip, is enough.   from   at Harvard Medical School shows that taking slow, deep breaths triggers the relaxation response and, Dr. Bowe said, “can stop psychological stress from being translated to physical inflammation in the skin.” Breath work classes, like those offered on the  , can help with technique. “Do not put on CNN with John King up there five minutes before bed,” Dr. Ciraldo said, which is to say, beware the   emitted from electronics. It interrupts your circadian rhythm and leads to lower-quality sleep, which is linked to increased cortisol, free radical damage and inflammation. “Something as simple as sleep can change the skin barrier,” Dr. Woolery-Lloyd said. To address and prevent free radical damage, fill your plate with antioxidants, which stabilize these unstable molecules to leave skin clearer, calmer, brighter and more even toned. Vitamins A and C (abundant in fruits and vegetables), lycopene (found in tomatoes), astaxanthin (salmon) and polyphenols (green tea, dark chocolate) are all great options, according to Dr. Bowe. Exercise increases antioxidants, as well. (Behold, the body produces yet another popular skin-care ingredient  .) It   cortisol levels, meaning fewer breakouts and a stronger skin barrier. And if you’re exercising outdoors? Even better. “I’m a big believer in the healing power of nature,” Dr. Woolery-Lloyd said. “People say, ‘I don’t have the time,’ but it doesn’t have to be this drawn out thing. Just going outside and seeing a tree and looking at a few birds is proven to lower inflammatory markers in our body.” If all else fails, cry. “Crying is a stress reliever and helps decrease cortisol levels,” said Dr. Purvisha Patel, a dermatologist and the founder of  . “This can result in fewer breakouts.” She notes that orgasms have a similar effect on cortisol (and are, by all accounts, more enjoyable). “This isn’t B.S.,” Dr. Ciraldo said. “These are things we can do for our skin and ourselves that don’t cost anything, but the reward is great.”"
The Lockdown Gave My Parents a Honeymoon Do-Over,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/style/the-lockdown-gave-my-parents-a-honeymoon-do-over.html,"This March, as the world marked one full year of the pandemic, my mother and stepfather celebrated their second go at a first wedding anniversary, 25 years after they divorced. I was 13 when they split. If you’d asked me then if I wished my mother, Fawn Waterfield, and my second stepfather, Chilton Allen Bowman III (C.A. to those who know him), would reunite, I’d have said no way. My father had long been out of the picture, and my first stepfather had moved to Sitka, Alaska, with our baby brother, Camden Buzard, leaving my little sister and me in nearby Juneau. I just wanted Mom to myself. C.A. had never shared space with young people before us and had a cat’s distaste for any change in his environment. We brought chaos and noise to his well-ordered life, upending a careful balance I couldn’t see at the time. I was a careless dishwasher and a laundry spendthrift, oblivious to the expense of each laundromat visit. We were deeply poor in the way of hippies who value experience over material goods, and I was a tight budget’s nightmare. It never occurred to me to offer him a little generosity of spirit back then. Instead, I made sure he knew I’d had my fill of dads and that my wily heart was a Mad Lib he’d never decipher. Our constant battles wore Mom down to pencil shavings. My sister, Tekla Waterfield, was more of a choose-your-own-adventure kid. She usually chose peace. A few months before they split, Mom’s adoptive father died. Her grief turned her inward. The endless bickering between C.A. and me, compounded by the stress of bereavement and a boundless hippie wanderlust, sealed their divorce. Tekla and I were relieved. We thought maybe we’d finally have Mom to ourselves, but we lost something valuable in that move. Mom and C.A. remained friendly, calling and sending postcards now and then. Mom settled in Salinas, Calif., teaching middle school art and English. She lived on an old wood yacht while saving to buy a house. C.A. worked for the Alaska Department of Transportation, slowly paying off the ramshackle house they had bought before we left Juneau. He called Mom the night he burned the mortgage documents, saying, “I can finally build the house we dreamed about.” He was siding the new house the first time I visited him in Juneau, during a long layover in 2007, 13 years after their divorce. Over lunch he said, mistily, “You’ve always been my daughter. Your mom will always be my wife.” His tenderness helped me see in my late 20s what I had overlooked as a child: a great fit for my mother. I finally understood his need for structure and organization. We stayed in touch after that. At first, Tekla and I were happy simply to have him back in our lives, but in 2015 Mom and C.A. were both single and in flux. Tekla and I decided: We wanted C.A. all the way back, for ourselves and for Mom. It took another three years to “Parent Trap” them once we set our minds to it. I invited C.A. to my home in Missoula, Mont., for Thanksgiving. He flew to Seattle for Tekla’s album release. “You should encourage Mom to visit Juneau,” Tekla and I told him during every visit and phone call. Mom was surprised by our nudges. “Seriously?” “He’s always loved you just the way you are,” I said. “We made it hard before, but you deserve that kind of love and we think you can have it still.” Tekla asked C.A. to give her away when she married in 2018. Mom beamed as they walked down the aisle together. She took C.A.’s hand when he sat down and hasn’t let go. They planned to remarry on June 19, 2020, their original anniversary. But when states began declaring Covid-19 lockdowns, they couldn’t wait. “What if the virus takes one of us before then?” Mom said. Our first pandemic video call as a family was on March 19, 2020, to attend a ceremony in their officiant’s home in Juneau. My brother, Camden, living in Juneau with his own family, and my parents’ neighbors stood as the only three witnesses. My two toddlers, 4 and 18 months, dressed up with me and my husband rushed home from work while I logged into Zoom for the first time ever. We couldn’t hear much, and I accidentally muted our cheers as my parents laughed and said, “I do … again.” My children and I have since spent countless hours at home on video calls with my folks. We recently chatted while Mom bent over an art project in her little kitchen nook. C.A. cooked dinner beside her while my children splattered watercolor paints everywhere, pausing to shout, “Look what I made!” C.A. cupped his hand and leaned close to the screen, straining to hear them over the squawk of his hearing aids. His long, braided goatee waggled when he spoke, and it set my kids to face-on-the-table laughing fits. “Beautiful!” Mom said. You wouldn’t know they’d ever been apart the way C.A. laid his hand on my mother’s back and gazed at her when she spoke, the way she pressed into him as though he had always been there. In January, a friend of Mom’s asked: “What is the best thing that happened in 2020?” Mom laughed, replying: “C.A.!” She turned to C.A. and repeated the question. He chuckled. “That’s easy. I married you.” At a time when lockdown has strained partnerships, my mom and C.A. forged a tighter bond. Hunkering down together gave them a long, blissful honeymoon do-over. And it gave me one small, beautiful thing to hold onto through this hard time, knowing that my parents were healthy, safe, and together again."
,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/style/DIY-sewing-rick-owens-stitches-a-souvenir.html,"DESIGNER D.I.Y. SERIES In the latest installment of our Designer D.I.Y. series, the designer embroiders a lover’s hankie. “During my mom’s Mexican youth, girls used to embroider their boyfriend’s initials on a handkerchief with their own hair,” Rick Owens wrote in an email from Paris, where he and his wife, Michele Lamy, live. Though hair can be a disconcerting substance when not attached to one’s own head, it has a rich history of use as a memento mori, used through the ages by artists, hobbyists, fetishists and smitten teens. “I loved that story,” Mr. Owens said. “So I asked my mom to embroider a handkerchief with her hair for me.” Years later, when the designer’s friends started having children, he plucked strands of his signature raven locks and embroidered the newborns’ initials on baby blankets that he gave to the new parents as gifts. Though the baroque atmospherics of the instructions below are not required (Mr. Owens may have been, as he wrote, on magic mushrooms when he composed them), it probably helps to be in some kind of swoon while you sew. STEP 1 “First, wash your silky hair in the milk of an ass, just as Claudette Colbert did while playing Empress Poppea,” Mr. Owens wrote, referring to the actress’s racy turn in “The Sign of the Cross,” Cecil B. DeMille’s 1932 pre-Code epic. TREsemmé would probably work just as well if you can’t find donkey’s milk in the dairy aisle. STEP 2 “Air-dry your hair by hanging it off a balcony in morning sun, combing and untangling it with a fine-toothed mother-of-pearl comb while the Montserrat Caballé version of Camille Saint-Saëns’s ‘Mon coeur s’ouvre a ta voix’ plays in the background,” Mr. Owens wrote. STEP 3 Lightly pencil the desired initials on the silk hankie, then stretch it over “your prettiest” embroidery hoop. STEP 4 Take three long healthy strands of hair from your head and thread them through the needle simultaneously. “Using a single strand will take forever,” he said. STEP 5 Slip on a thimble and start embroidering the initials of the one you love. “Find a cozy place to sit outside under a tree,” Mr. Owens said. “This could very well take all day.” Top photo: Getty Images"
The Year of the Wedding After-Party,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/style/wedding-after-parties.html,"If 2020 was the year of the Zoom wedding, 2021 promises to be a year of after-parties. Covid-era newlyweds who pared down their guest lists and exchanged vows via livestream are planning full-on second weddings. But with those plans come an awkward set of etiquette questions. Is it OK to ask virtual guests to attend an in-person reception a year later? Should you expect gifts? And what do you name this event? A vow renewal? An anniversary reception? A sequel? After calling off plans for a big wedding last May, Erin Wronka, 27, sprinted to organize a 20-person ceremony in July in Tampa, Fla., where she grew up. Sixty guests joined on Zoom. Now, she and her husband, Michael Baldwin, 26, are planning a 120-person reception at their original venue, the Manor in West Orange, N.J., on Aug. 13. She’s been calling the party “Part Two.” “When we were going to tell our family about the new date, we were like, ‘They’re going to laugh at us,’” Ms. Wronka, a public relations executive in Clark, N.J., said. “They’re going to think we’re so annoying. They just celebrated us.” But the couple knew the delayed reception was right for them. “One day we could tell our kids this: how we got married in a pandemic and got to party twice,” she said. According to , 32 percent of couples who planned to marry in 2020 pushed their receptions to 2021 or later. And a third of newlyweds who had both a ceremony and a reception last year plan to have another, larger celebration in the future. While the etiquette of these post-pandemic receptions is unsettled, wedding planners and couples alike say these events provide an opportunity for loved ones to gather without the pressure of a wedding. “If something goes wrong, it’s not like, ‘Oh my God, the wedding day, the most important day of our lives is ruined,’” said Elizabeth Hilbert, a product marketing manager in San Diego. “We’re married. We’re just here for a good time.” Ms. Hilbert, 26, and her longtime partner, Anish Tondwalkar, 26, a software engineer, married in a Hindu ceremony in December in the living room of the groom’s parents. Only immediate family members attended; their grandparents watched via Zoom. They are planning a reception close to their first anniversary, though they may postpone depending on pandemic conditions. “Maybe it’ll be a one-and-a-half-year anniversary or a two-year anniversary slash wedding reception,” Mr. Tondwalkar said. If you’re wondering whether to have a post-Covid wedding blowout, here are some things to keep in mind. Many couples are planning a reception on their first wedding anniversary. “It almost reminds me of a first birthday party,” said Kim Forrest, a senior editor at WeddingWire. “There’s such a big deal about that first year.” An anniversary party can include some of the traditions of a typical reception, but it doesn’t have to. “This is the couple’s opportunity to be creative in whatever way they want,” said Dayna Isom Johnson, a trend expert for Etsy. “It’s really just about how they can bring their love story back to life and celebrate it with their friends and family.” Consider writing new vows for a vow renewal, or simply presenting a recap of your wedding. “We do have some couples who will be debuting their wedding video from the ceremony that took place last year so that guests can be a part of the original moment,” said Kate Murtaugh, a wedding planner and event designer in the greater Boston area. And if you missed out on rituals like the first dance or cake-cutting, don’t be afraid to incorporate or remix them in the reception, like with an anniversary cake topper. If you got married in private, without friends and family tuning in remotely, you have more options. Enter the sequel wedding. This tradition is nothing new. In some countries where civil ceremonies are required, like France and Mexico, it’s common to have a symbolic ceremony and reception after the couple has been legally married. Allison and Connor Weins married last September at Novelty Hill-Januik Winery in Woodinville, Wash. A friend officiated, and two other friends witnessed. Their 100-person wedding in Seattle will take place on Sept. 5, the day before their first anniversary, with both a ceremony and reception. (Covid restrictions could dictate a smaller guest list.) “The advantage of doing the elopement was that we did not have to worry about our parents being in the room, so we could say vows that were maybe a little bit funnier,” Mr. Weins, 29 and a software development manager, said. But it was no replacement for a full wedding. “I still haven’t gotten a chance to wear my wedding dress, which is actually a key thing I’m most disappointed about,” Ms. Weins, a 28-year-old product manager, said. “We are still planning to do the walk down the aisle and do first looks and have a more family-friendly set of vows. Because I do think the joy of having a wedding is it’s not only about commemorating the relationship that we have, but all the people who have helped us become who we are, who will support us in the future.” If you’ve already sent out multiple save-the-date and change-the-date cards, it can feel awkward sending more notices. “Everyone was starting to make fun of us. They’re like, ‘Our whole fridge is you guys,’” Ms. Wronka said. “I was like, we can’t send another piece of mail.” She opted to send digital invitations, with paper invitations to come a few months before the reception. Couples should be open and honest with guests. “These are the closest people to you,” Ms. Johnson at Etsy said. “These are people you can openly communicate with.” The medium, she said, isn’t as important as giving people “the lowdown of where you guys are and what the next steps will be.” For anniversary receptions, Ms. Forrest recommends sending printed invitations to match the event’s importance, “and just skipping the language that refers to a ceremony.” Gift-giving etiquette depends on your original plans. Did you already have a registry for a postponed or canceled wedding? It’s fine to keep those gifts, but don’t create an expectation for guests to gift twice. “It’s completely up to the attendees if they want to gift more than just that first time,” Ms. Johnson said. And, if you’re wondering whether it’s OK to require guests to be vaccinated: “It’s really whatever the bride and groom are comfortable with. They’re the boss,” said Christian Weiler, an owner of Epic Events, a wedding and event planning company in greater San Diego. “So anything they want is appropriate.” Anniversary receptions are “going to run a little bit more on the casual side,” Ms. Forrest, of WeddingWire, said. “It could be a great opportunity to choose something more fashion forward.” This might include a bridal jumpsuit or shorter dress.  Decorations, too, can be less formal. “We’re going to see really unique and interesting décor come out of these anniversary receptions and sequel weddings, because it’s all about having fun and celebrating,” Ms. Forrest said. “Brighter colors, exaggerated florals, really cool lighting.” Consider getting creative with paper, the classic material used to mark first anniversaries. “It’ll be interesting to see how couples can incorporate that material into the celebration,” Ms. Johnson said. Even as Americans slowly get vaccinated and prepare to re-enter society, it’s far from clear when parties as we once knew them will be safe. If the uncertainty makes you uneasy, you can still plan a wedding that replaces the need for a reception. “We’re really anxious that this September is still not going to be safe,” Ms. Weins said. “And the thought of pushing it again just feels like stringing all our friends along.” If they have to call it off, they plan to rent out bars and throw a series of   in different cities. “We call it our wedding roadshow,” she said. Last June, Anne-Marie Hantman, 31, and Rohan Thakkar, 32, hired a videographer to stream their Hindu and Christian ceremonies to an audience of more than 500, with group chats and FaceTime calls with family and the bridal party throughout the day. Ms. Hantman, a higher education administrator, and Mr. Thakkar, a business systems manager, kept thinking they would eventually host a reception in person. But with no end to the pandemic in sight, planning anything felt impossible. It also felt unnecessary; the couple had gotten everything they wanted from their live-streamed event. “We got married in a beautiful, unique way,” Mr. Thakkar said. “And folks were still raving about how much fun they had.”"

What’s a jewelry designer to do without her jewels? Go back to the basics — sketching and painting — and play around with some new materials. Here, Ms. Neuwirth used one of her spring 2020 designs as inspiration for a colorful, one-of-a-kind necklace. She completed the project in about three hours, she said, “with pauses to take the dogs out, sit in the yard, answer emails.” STEP 1 On white sheets of paper, Ms. Neuwirth drew seven distinct flowers, using her   as a guide. Then she painted each flower in shades of blue, pink or yellow. Draw each flower in slightly varying sizes, with the largest being about 3 inches in diameter. Ideally no two blooms will look exactly alike; that’s the charm of the project. Fill in each with a watercolor — either the summery palate Ms. Neuwirth chose or your own combination of colors. Let the flowers dry before cutting out each one. STEP 2 Using your double-sided tape, fasten the back of each flower onto your ribbon or twine. Arrange the flowers so that they’re all touching, with some edges slightly overlapping. Tie the ends of the ribbon in a bow."
Lack of Covid Rules Fuel the Return of Big Weddings,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/style/lack-of-covid-rules-fuel-the-return-of-big-weddings.html,"When   on March 6, it was a sign of how large weddings are returning to Texas — and beyond — amid the loosening of Covid-19 restrictions. The couple had planned to celebrate with 1,000 guests and said it was important to them to have a big wedding. “A big thing we said to multiple people is to not feel pressured on attending our wedding as we understood the current state of the world,” Ms. Egwuatu said afterward. Guests were still required to wear masks and sign a waiver indicating they were Covid-free. Large gatherings are   by the Centers for Disease Control. “If you’re set on hundreds of people, you have to be prepared,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. “Any kind of mass gathering, if you’ve got a lot of unvaccinated individuals, is likely to result in cases and exposures.” “People are getting mixed messaging,” said Dr. Maria E. Rivera, a local health authority for Harris County Public Health in Houston. “We’ve been discouraging people from having large weddings, but it’s been a challenge since the  .” In early March, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas ended any mask or gathering requirements, with some caveats. If a couple proceeds with a supersized wedding, mitigation measures should be taken. “You should think about rapid testing everyone, though that may be cost prohibitive for most people and logistically difficult,” Dr. Adalja said. All events should be moved outdoors, he said. Pre- and post-wedding quarantines, proof of negative PCR tests, strict mask mandates and social distancing should also be considered. For Wendy Kay, the owner of Birds of a Feather Events, a Dallas wedding planning company, Gov. Abbott’s decision to allow large weddings has been a disappointment. Her company won’t produce any large weddings until this fall, when Ms. Kay anticipates that all guests will have had an opportunity to be vaccinated. “We’re almost there, we’re so close to the finish line with this pandemic,” Ms. Kay said. “But we’re not there yet, and still I’m seeing Instagram stories every weekend of these huge weddings — absolute ragers, with no one wearing a mask.

After the Great Recession of 2008, for example, there were rumors that Hermès shoppers were carrying   instead of bright orange ones, and that the wealthy were holding secret shopping parties so not to flaunt their ability to spend. Identifiable luxury logos were definitely out. Then, of course, the logos came roaring back, which means that anybody who has been buying fashion over the last decade probably has some highly branded stuff in their closet — stuff that may seem even more like a red flag today, given the increasing focus on the   in the United States and the deep pain many families have experienced over the last year, with lost jobs and homes. At the same time, saving your money, thinking deeply about your purchases and investing in a few responsibly and well-made pieces that you will keep for decades (and maybe pass down to your kids) is exactly the kind of shopping we should all be doing if we possibly can. It’s better for the environment, for our own long-term economic stability and for building a sense of personal style. It is not something to be embarrassed about or to eschew. But it’s not as if you can walk around your new job with a bubble floating above your designer bag explaining how and why you acquired it. And while I’d like to say that the bag you carry or shoes you wear doesn’t matter in the context of your job — all that matters is the work you do and the results you deliver — that would be naïve. I’ve heard too many stories about women going in for salary negotiations and the subliminal judgments that ensue, often based in part on how they dress. So what to do? I called two experts who have deep knowledge of the semiology of dress in the corridors of power: Ikram Goldman, the Chicago retailer who has outfitted Michelle Obama and Mellody Hobson, and Joanna Coles, the producer, author and former Hearst supremo who used to hold an annual Power 100 lunch. Ikram made the point that in any job, confidence is key, and your clothes can go a long way to bolstering confidence. Presentation in the workplace matters for everyone, whether we want to admit it or not. (That’s why often-unspoken office dress codes exist.) If you feel good, people can tell, and if you feel insecure, that will come through, too. Presumably, however, you bought these pieces because they gave you a certain assurance and poise. And in that case, Joanna said: “You should use them every day and very much enjoy them! You can always dress them down with jeans and T-shirts or sneakers so you don’t appear to be screaming ‘designer.’” Indeed, there’s a difference between owning one or two designer bags and carrying them every day, amortizing the price over time, and owning a Kardashian-sized closet of Birkins and carrying a different one every day. That would raise a few eyebrows. So if your investment pieces make you feel strong and ready to do your job, great. But if you are spending time worrying about how others see them, that’s time taken away from what you are doing. Which is, after all, why you are there. The calculation is simple: Your clothes should   for you. Do they?"
She Had a ‘Million’ Questions. He Had One for Her.,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/style/mystery-wedding-destination.html,"After going on a first date in August 2018 with Ondrej Antos, Nina Umont told a friend that she was going to marry him. “There are times when you don’t know how to start a conversation with somebody, but this was not one of those times,” said Ms. Umont, 30, a calligrapher and artist whose business, Sandelin Designs, is in the San Francisco Bay Area. “He’s European, so this was different,” Ms. Umont said. “I had a million questions, like ‘What brought you to the United States? What brought you to the Bay Area?’” she said. “We exchanged dozens of text messages at a time and had a full conversation before we ever met in person.” “I thought he was so smart and I was interested in everything he talked about,” said Ms. Umont, who graduated from Reed College and received a master’s degree in linguistics from McGill University. Like Ms. Umont, Mr. Antos, 32, the chief executive and a founder of Klarity, an artificial intelligence start-up company based in San Francisco, could not stop talking about the great conversations they shared during their six-day chat fest on the dating website Bumble. “We had a super-wide-ranging conversation on all kinds of topics,” said Mr. Antos, who graduated from Masaryk University in the Czech Republic, where he was born and learned English at a young age, and received a Master of Laws degree from Harvard. “She was beautiful and had such great style,” Mr. Antos said. “She was also a very talented artist with a great sense of humor. I was mesmerized by her.” Having texted, talked or emailed around the clock for nearly a week, both were wide-eyed and wired for their first in-person meeting at a restaurant in Menlo Park, Calif. “I was tired but I couldn’t sleep,” Mr. Antos said. “Neither could I,” Ms. Umont said. “It was a perfect night,” Ms. Umont said. “We got along so well, and at one point, he asked me if I knew anything about red wine and I said yes,” she said. “That was a lie, but I was just doing my best to impress him.” Just after dessert, Ms. Umont asked Mr. Antos if there was anything else he wanted. “Yes,” he said, “I’d like to go out with you on a second and third date.” Ms. Umont quickly obliged. “From that moment on, we were an exclusive item,” she said. “We were always meant to be.” In August 2018, Mr. Antos invited Ms. Umont to the upcoming November wedding of a best friend. Again, she did not hesitate, nor did she ask where the wedding venue was located. A few weeks before the wedding, Mr. Antos asked Ms. Umont if she was looking forward to it. “Oh yes,” she said, “I love Long Island.” “Huh,” said Mr. Antos, his eyebrows shooting north. The wedding, he told her, was in New Delhi. Stunned but certainly not dissuaded, Ms. Umont obliged Mr. Antos once again. In the ensuing weeks, as feelings for each other grew deeper and deeper, the writing was on the wall: “We knew we were meant to be,” Ms. Umont said, “and that one day we were going to get married.” They were engaged in March 2020 on Mount Diablo, a mountain in the Bay Area. Mr. Antos had originally planned to propose during a vacation in northern Italy the following month, but the  . Before the pandemic, Ms. Umont and Mr. Antos had hoped to marry in the Czech Republic, surrounded by family and friends, but are now planning a ceremony there for 2022. They were married in the United States on March 27, in an outdoor ceremony in Carmel-by-the-Sea, Calif. Nischal Nadhamuni, a friend of the groom who became a Universal Life minister for the event, officiated. “He’s such a fascinating guy,” the bride said of the groom. “I guess I’ll never stop asking him questions.”"
"The Key to Successful Pandemic Parenting? Take Care of Yourself, Too.",style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/fashion/weddings/the-key-to-successful-pandemic-parenting-take-care-of-yourself-too.html,"Last November, Lance Gross, an actor known for his roles on various Tyler Perry productions including “Tyler Perry’s House of Payne,” had to say goodbye to his family for four weeks as he embarked on his first movie project since the coronavirus lockdown began. As this film project began to ramp up, it did so with one major change from the prepandemic times: No one could leave the studio until filming wrapped. Once the cast and crew arrived on set in Atlanta, with negative Covid-19 tests, it essentially became a production bubble. For Mr. Gross, 39, it was the longest he had ever spent away from his wife, Rebecca Gross, 35, a stylist, and their two children, a daughter, Berkeley, 6, and a son, Lennon, 2. It was a shock to the daily routine for all four of them, who spent every day together for nine months. But it offered something meaningful to Mr. Gross’s psyche. “I absolutely love what I do,” he said. “To bring characters to life is a creative pursuit that fulfills me.” Like many families, everything changed for the Grosses during quarantine. Not only did Mr. Gross’s filming schedule shut down, Ms. Gross’s personal styling business was also put on pause. Instead, the couple, who live in Los Angeles, jumped into home-schooling their daughter and managing an active toddler, 18 months at the time. While they had always been very present parents, they had balanced parenting with their busy careers and rich social lives, allowing them to feel fulfilled personally and in their relationship with each other. Now, it became parenting, and only parenting, 24/7. “As parents, you just do what you have to do — it doesn’t matter if it’s hard or challenging,” Ms. Gross said. “But when you put yourself on the back burner, you will get burned out. It was a journey, but we realized it’s important to carve out time to be your best partner, your best parent and your best self.” A few months ago, though, Ms. Gross said they found the trick that helped them through it all: creating “me” time. She believes all parents need a moment to refill their own “love tanks” both individually and together. “When your tank gets really low, it’s harder to cope with everyday challenges,” Ms. Gross said. “Before quarantine, we were able to build those tanks without really thinking about it, having personal time, traveling, working, even small moments in the car playing music. All of that was robbed.” She recalled a day when Mr. Gross walked around the house in a “grumpy” mood. She realized that he had not been alone nor did he have a creative pursuit at the moment, no space to fill his love tank. She told him that he needed to go take some time for himself. Mr. Gross agreed, and he began to include screenwriting into his daily routine. Similarly, Ms. Gross noticed that she missed her girlfriends. Last fall, she organized a tailgate, where she and a few other women parked in a socially distant circle in a nearby lot. They sat by their vehicles with takeout food, going over the high and low points of pandemic life.  Together, Mr. and Ms. Gross thrive on being a team in the household. Although they enjoy their roles as parents, they still needed time to nurture their partnership. They sneaked out for a date night twice a month to a drive-in movie theater, without their children (they have a nanny that comes regularly, with proper safety measures put in place). Going to the movies has long been an integral part of their relationship and gave them some semblance of normalcy and a chance to bond. Going back to work also provided a welcome shift in their schedule and increased the energy they each brought to the family. Both Mr. and Ms. Gross are creative people and find their respective jobs to be immensely fulfilling. Despite the unpredictable nature of their careers — the long hours and hectic travel schedules — they have always supported each other’s endeavors. It may have required more logistics to do so during the pandemic, but they made sure to tag-team parenting and household duties to allow each other to take advantage of professional opportunities. Ms. Gross said the first photo shoot she conducted after mandatory lockdown felt like a true mood booster. She has easily adapted to strict Covid-19 safety protocols. She often sources clothing through photographs and Zoom meetings, and books solo appointments at showrooms. Mr. Gross often handles bath time so she can check emails and respond to clients. While Mr. Gross was away filming in November, Ms. Gross said it was difficult juggling the needs of two children. It helped that Mr. Gross called daily via FaceTime to laugh with their children and offer her emotional support. It felt like a team, even while they were apart. The couple give off a refreshing air of optimism. Ms. Gross tries not to dwell on the disappointments, even though the family has faced some major ones over the last year. In addition to having their industries shut down, they canceled their annual holiday gathering with extended family at Big Bear Lake, Calif., for the first time ever. They struggled daily with attempts to have their daughter adapt to a virtual classroom setting; sitting in front of a screen all day is a challenge for a 5-year-old. (“It was a learning curve for all of us,” Ms. Gross said.) Through it all, Mr. and Ms. Gross chose to inhabit the happy end of the spectrum. Mr. Gross relishes how he has been there for Lennon’s milestones, releasing the anxiety that often haunted him on prepandemic travels and film sets. Mr. Gross wrote a screenplay, a goal he said he never would have achieved because of his schedule before the pandemic. “I looked at it as a positive, because it was a time to reset,” he said. “To be with my children and my wife for this extended period of time was such a blessing to me.” Ms. Gross developed new ways to connect with their daughter, Berkeley, including Friday treats like sushi takeout for lunch or a movie, with no little brother in tow. As husband and wife, they have devoted time to themselves and each other, too. “Life isn’t going to open up a moment for you to distance yourself from the hustle and bustle of the day to day,” Ms. Gross said. “You have to be deliberate about it.”"
She Met a Pilot on a Plane to London,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/style/married-travelers.html,"If not for a one-hour flight to London from Paris, Sonia Brozak and Matthieu Autret probably would never have landed an opportunity to live together in New York. “I couldn’t help but notice her — she was gorgeous,” said Mr. Autret, a private-jet pilot, recalling the flight in October 2019. She sat in seat 1A and he in 1B. “He was reading, then he got up to take off his jacket, and that’s when we started talking,” said Ms. Brozak, who for much of the last five years worked in visitor services at the Tate Modern museum in London and as a tour guide at the Louvre Museum in Paris. Mr. Autret mentioned during their flight that his mother, Stéphanie Autret, was a painter. At the time, both Ms. Brozak and Mr. Autret were living in Paris. She was on her way to London for a job interview and he to a weeklong evaluation of pilots at an airline there. Upon landing, they spent another half-hour chatting at the baggage carousel, and before going their separate ways, agreed to have dinner when they returned to Paris. That dinner, at Terrace de l’Alcazar in the Latin Quarter, turned into a first date. Just a few months later, the couple moved together to Geneva. Avid skiers, they spent the winter in Chamonix, France. “He was terribly handsome, and just so kind, a real gentleman,” said Ms. Brozak, who graduated from Washington and Lee University in Lexington City, Va., and received a master’s degree in art history from University College London. “He was also very considerate and highly intellectual,” she said. “He was just a well-rounded, very-well-put-together person.” Ms. Brozak and Mr. Autret returned to Paris just as France’s   lockdown measures took effect in March 2020. Both stayed in the home of Mr. Autret’s parents. When Ms. Brozak returned to her native New York in January, she took more than souvenirs and a few leftover euros. She also took Mr. Autret. “Our original plan was to live in France,” she said. “As it happened, Matthieu was still searching for a job when I was accepted to law school here,” said Ms. Brozak. She said she was accepted to several law schools in the city and hasn’t yet decided which to attend. Mr. Autret said he “really enjoys living in New York.” They live together on the Upper East Side. He completed his pilot training at the Florida Flight Training Center in Venice, Fla., and received European and American flight certifications in England, Germany and Spain. “I would be happy living just about anywhere,” Mr. Autret said, “as long as it is with Sonia.” The couple were engaged during a ski tour on Dec. 31, 2020, at the top of the Tour glacier in Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, France. Mr. Autret was the first to reach the summit. When Ms. Brozak arrived, he dropped down on one knee, ring in glove, and proposed. They were married in Pound Ridge, N.Y., on March 26 at the summer townhouse of the bride’s parents, Elizabeth Kavaler and Stephen Brozak. Matthew Brotmann, a justice of the peace for the town of Pound Ridge, officiated. The groom’s parents, Stephanie Autret and Bertrand Autret, were unable to attend because of coronavirus restrictions, which also forced the bride and groom to scrap their original wedding plans. They had planned to marry in France, in the home garden of the groom’s parents. “Our families have never met,” the bride said, “but when this virus finally disappears, that will change very, very quickly.”"

"They Got Lost in the Woods, Then Eloped in the Snow",style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/style/weddings-married-in-vermont.html,"On their second date, Dr. Anais Ovalle and Emily Black got lost hiking at the Moose Hill Wildlife Sanctuary in Sharon, Mass. Snow fell and then it got dark. Even though they lost cellphone service for a while and eventually had to call an Uber to get to their cars, both kept their cool. Dr. Ovalle would later refer to that date, which took place March 4, 2018, in her wedding vows. “We absorbed the peace of being in each other’s presence,” she said. “We witnessed the beauty of the world around us. This was when I knew a life with you would be different.” Ms. Black, 33, is a product manager in the Boston office of Autodesk, a software company based in San Rafael, Calif. Although she completed law school, she decided she did not want to practice law, nor marry the man she was engaged to, nor “check off all the boxes,” as Southern women like her are supposed to do, she said. And in 2017, she had a health scare that made her not take things for granted. Dr. Ovalle, 31, grew up in New Jersey and the Dominican Republic. She attended medical school in Santo Domingo and returned to the United States for residency. “I could be myself here and fall in love,” she said. She is an infectious disease fellow and preventive medicine resident at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H., where the couple now live. During her residency, Dr. Ovalle was living in Providence, R.I. Her first marriage had ended, and when not at the hospital, she frequented a coffee shop, where she said she asked out any woman “who looked like she might be queer.” This strategy didn’t work so well. In January 2018, she begrudgingly went on Tinder, where Ms. Black, living in Boston, stood out. They exchanged messages for more than a month. They chose a bar halfway between them, in Foxborough, Mass., to meet in February 2018. They stayed for more than five hours, and even chatted outside after the bar closed. Both say they were immediately taken with the other. In the coming months, though, Dr. Ovalle needed to make decisions about where her career might take her. They discussed which locations would work for Ms. Black. But, being one for grand gestures, Dr. Ovalle wanted to make one. Knowing that Ms. Black wanted a dog, she found a miniature American shepherd in Missouri and booked flights. “She just has the biggest heart and sense of adventure,” Ms. Black said. “She cares so much about the world and about doing good in the world.” Dr. Ovalle was the first to ask Ms. Black to be her girlfriend, and to say “I love you.” Ms. Black felt strongly that she should be the one to propose. Dr. Ovalle wasn’t having it. She repeatedly asked Ms. Black to marry her. “Not yet” became a common refrain. In May 2019, Ms. Black planned a weekend getaway in Portland, Me., where she presented a photo album to Dr. Ovalle, ending with a proposal and a ring. They planned to marry in New Zealand in March 2021, giving friends and family an excuse to travel there, but   intervened. Instead the two eloped during a ski vacation at Green Mountain Inn in Stowe, Vt. They were married there March 4 by Mitzi McInnis, a justice of the peace. Just the couple, their officiant and a photographer were in attendance. After the ceremony, both brides donned faux fur stoles over their wedding gowns and boots with spikes to hike to the frozen Bingham Falls — scouted out by Dr. Ovalle — for photos. They are taking the name Ovalle-Black. “I always feel like I’m buzzing internally,” Dr. Ovalle said. “But when I’m around Emily, I feel this internal calmness. She knows what I’m feeling without my having to speak.”"
Boomers Are Vaccinated and Down to Party,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/style/boomers-are-vaccinated-and-down-to-party.html,"In a glimpse of our post-pandemic world, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently set forth  . Among other things, they can hang out indoors and mask-free with small groups of other inoculated people. But you don’t need to tell that to the 6,000 older residents of  , a 1,400-acre “residential country club” in southern Florida that attracts the 65-plus set. On a recent 80-degree afternoon, four retired women, wearing full bathing suits and sandals, were laughing and drinking daiquiris, mai tais and other fruity cocktails at Splash, the poolside bar and restaurant. A crowd gathered for happy hour on the central lawn, where a pipe band played cheerful jigs and waiters refilled martini glasses. A short walk away, under a large tent decorated with chandeliers, a band performed Frank Sinatra favorites as couples in their 60s to 90s, dressed in slacks and floral shirts, danced the fox trot and jitterbug. Neena Florsheim, a resident in her mid-60s, might have hit the dance floor, but she was busy preparing a dinner party — her first in more than a year — for eight people in her contemporary three-bedroom home at the Cove. She opened the expandable dining table, set out an assortment of Dr. Brown’s sodas and liquors, and ordered Chinese food. “We went through so much glassware, good thing I have two dishwashers,” said Ms. Florsheim, who got her second Pfizer shot on Feb. 1. “We’ve been rocking and rolling for a few weeks now.” Boomers are bringing back the Roaring Twenties, reviving the party scene across the country. With nearly   of Americans 65 and over fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C., they are attending house parties, venturing to bars, hosting wine socials and having sleepovers. Stuck indoors at home for much of the last year, they are basking in their newfound freedom, as if on (a very mild) spring break. “We were high as a kite getting ready,” said Martha Stoodley, 76, a retired management consultant and yoga   in Muskogee, Okla. After getting her second Moderna dose on Feb. 12, she waited a few weeks for the immunity to kick in. Then she invited some yoga students over for a wine and cheese party. “No one could come unless they were double vaccinated,” she said. “I trusted them.” Ms. Stoodley and her husband spent the day baking bread, making stuffed mushrooms, laying out platters of meat and cheese, and arranging daffodils and lavender from their garden. Guests were a little tentative at first. “They all arrived with their masks on, until I told them Fauci said we didn’t have to wear them and they took them off,” she said. The party went on for hours. “It was nonstop chatting,” Ms. Stoodley said. “We were talking, comparing notes of where we want to travel, comparing notes about Covid, talking about our families, anything.” These gatherings are a view into what social life could soon look like for the wider population. Many states have lowered the   in recent weeks, with several now offering shots to anyone 16 or older. It should go without saying that partying is not the first priority for many older Americans who got vaccinated. Going to the grocery store without fear and seeing grandchildren are way more important. But after a year of intense social distancing and constant reminders of being at high risk, they are embracing their liberated social life with gusto. When Elissa Fisher, 66, a retired special education teacher in Fishkill, N.Y., got vaccinated, the first thing she wanted to do was have a sleepover party with a close friend who lives nearby and whom she hadn’t seen in months. The plan was a fish dinner and a movie, but French gimlets led to bottles of wine, and before they knew it, it was nearly midnight. “We were just laughing so much, I couldn’t even tell you about what,” Ms. Fisher said. “There were silly stories. My friend started speaking Finnish to me at some point. We would start one conversation and get distracted and go on tangents.” Bars and clubs are also getting a boost from an older clientele. For 15 years, John Kurtz, 79, a painter in Chicago, had been a regular at the  , an old-timey tavern two blocks from his house that makes a good burger. He used to go there maybe twice a week to chat with fellow artists or to sit alone with his sketchbook and crayons, up until the city’s first shelter-in-place order. Mr. Kurtz counted the days after his second vaccine to return to his seat by the window and ordered a German lager. “It’s nice to get the fresh air and look out,” he said. “It was kind of nostalgic. The camaraderie is good, the food is good, the beer, you can’t mess with that. And if I had one too many, it’s easy to get home.” The bar has become a place of spontaneous reunions. “Once the state opened up vaccines to 65 plus, we started seeing more of the older generation,” said Jeff Hoffman, the owner of the Village Tap. “They were showing each other their vaccine cards, comparing who had Moderna and who had Pfizer.” “This one man, we hadn’t seen in a long time, and he came back to his regular seat,” Mr. Hoffman added. “He used to do tequila shots, but this time he upped his game and went for Don Julio 1942. He was so excited to be back, he ordered a round for all the bartenders.”"
The Elimination Diet for Skin,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/style/skin-self-care-the-end-of-the-10-step-beauty-routine.html,"When Jodie Naglie moved back into her parents’ home in Orange County, Calif., to quarantine last spring, the first thing she did was upgrade her skin-care collection. Newly flush with cash after giving up a San Francisco apartment, Ms. Naglie, 27, an account manager at an advertising agency, could finally afford the products recommended by influencers who “blew up” on TikTok during the pandemic, like   and  . Soon, Ms. Naglie added a second cleanse, a beta hydroxy exfoliant, a hyaluronic acid, a vitamin C serum, a hydration serum with niacinamide and retinol. Her two-step routine quadrupled. Her skin looked flawless for a couple of days, and then the irritation started. She abandoned her new regimen as quickly as she committed to it, applying nothing but moisturizer for 10 days before rebuilding a streamlined routine. Now, she uses a cleanser, a single serum and moisturizer. “It seemed like there was an overwhelming number of things I needed to prepare my skin for — and I needed to start doing it  ,” Ms. Naglie said. She felt pressure to use retinols, vitamin C, niacinamide and other of-the-moment ingredients that are supposed to clear blemishes and prevent wrinkles and saggy skin. This is why April Gargiulo, the founder of the   skin-care brand, sells only two products, a water-based hydrator and an oil-based serum. Combined, they contain all the ingredients one typically gets from a multitude of items, Ms. Gargiulo said. She recommends using both, along with a sunscreen, and nothing else. Dr. Ellen Marmur, a dermatologic surgeon and founder of  , makes three serums — one for the morning, one for the evening and another that can be used any time. Simplicity has always been the foundation of  , which introduced its 3-Step System in 1968: a cleanser, a toner and that iconic yellow moisturizer. It remains a best seller to this day. They are the antithesis of the Korean beauty brands that swept the United States several years ago, which made applying 10 skin-care products before going to bed an acceptable thing to do. Influencers on YouTube, Instagram and now TikTok made videos about their lengthy regimens, mostly with products they got for free or were paid to use. Many viewers were captivated by these maximalist routines, from cleansing (and cleansing again) to gently patting on a facial oil, the finale. It makes for great theater, but it turns out that most people probably don’t need half of the things they’re using. Doctors and beauty experts say that many of the products lining bathroom vanities — the second cleanser, toner, essence, scrubs, neck cream and, yes, even eye cream — usually fall short of addressing the concerns they claim to. “Ninety-five percent of people are using too many products,” said Dr. Heather Rogers, a dermatologist and founder of  , a skin-care line of four products (one is an all-purpose healing balm). “It’s actually making their skin irritated, aging them or not getting them where they need to be.” Dr. Rogers, Dr. Marmur and Ms. Gargiulo don’t make (or use) eye cream, a huge moneymaker because it comes in a tiny jar that costs the same or more than the moisturizer it contains. And often, eye cream is not that much different from facial cream, according to Marisa Plescia, a cosmetic chemist at Bell International Laboratories and a research scientist at  , an online beauty store. (She noted that there are exceptions with specialized ingredients like caffeine, which you would not find in a facial cream.) “I’m using just cocoa butter and it’s $3.59 at CVS, and it’s just fine,” said Roxanne Brown, a fashion stylist in New York. “I have friends who literally buy every product, and they’re like, ‘My skin is going crazy.’” Many of her peers had a similar experience to Ms. Naglie’s: the more skin-care products they used, the more issues they had. “You need products for the products,” Ms. Brown said. A combination of taut, glowy influencers, who rely on elaborate routines to get views, and brands, under pressure to introduce a set number of new products per year (to meet sales goals), are partly to blame. And the pandemic didn’t help the product pile-on. Interest in self-care skyrocketed, and people tuned into more skin-care tutorials, stuck at home and ready to experiment. Followers were chasing the perfect complexions staring back at them from the screen. “Consumers buy products because they think they will look like influencers look on social media,” said Ms. Plescia, who added that influencers may well be using Botox or lasers. “Their skin already looks flawless. It’s a show.” Instead, she said, the focus should shift to realistic outcomes. Multitaskers that combine steps with high levels of active ingredients could appeal to women who are short on time, money or both. Doctor Rogers Restore face cream and lotion are meant to be used as eye creams, and MMSkincare’s serums, $85 each, double as moisturizer. This, along with a trend toward simplicity, is changing the way we perceive skin care. Many people are reassessing what their skin needs (less), just as many in the fashion industry are rethinking their addictions. There will always be a consumer who craves the ritual of a long skin-care routine (and one with an aversion to repeating outfits), but brands are starting to cater to increasingly minimalist shoppers. “It doesn’t mean that consumers will go back to one product,” said Michelle Freyre, the global brand general manager at Clinique. “They’ll go back to more simple routines. That whole behavior, the buying everything that an influencer is telling you, the 20,000 products — that’s going to happen a lot less.” Tina Craig, also known as Bag Snob, the name of the designer handbag blog she started 15 years ago, used to travel with an extra suitcase of 20 full-size skin-care products (and a few pairs of shoes). At its peak, Ms. Craig’s evening routine reached 15 steps (and 30 minutes). She proudly blogged about this, sharing the exhaustive list of emulsions she applied to her face, morning and night. One time, she canceled a flight to Las Vegas because she forgot her skin-care suitcase. (She flew out the next day.) Eventually, the number of products got out of hand, and Ms. Craig’s rosacea flared up. She knew she had to downsize. “I was doing so much to my skin,” said Ms. Craig, 50. “What made it look good was what made me break out.” Last year, she came out with  , a skin-care brand with a serum, the Compound, and a moisturizer, the Super Smart Hydrator. Ms. Craig will “leave room for newness” but plans to stick to her Four C’s ideology: cleanse, compound, cream and cover (with sunscreen).

Weirdly, It Worked.",style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/style/weddings-coral-gables.html,"Jennifer Valdes had a feeling someone was watching her while she was at a birthday dinner in October 2013 at Café Martorano, a restaurant in Oakland Park, Fla. “I glanced over and caught a stranger gazing in my direction,” Ms. Valdes said. “I asked my friend Lauren to verify since it was very dark. She confirmed. Just as we were wrapping up, a server placed a shot and a business card in front of me on the table and said, ‘This is from my manager.’” Brian Skogen, the restaurant manager then, had noticed Ms. Valdes the second she entered the place. “When Jen caught my eye, I began plotting how I could get her number,” he said. “I sent a server over with my card and a drink. But after a while, I could stand it no longer and went over and introduced myself.” After exchanging pleasantries, Ms. Valdes, 35, gave Mr. Skogen, 39, her business card. Two days later he called and asked Ms. Valdes out on a date for the following Tuesday. They met for cocktails, then shared a bottle of wine and sushi rolls at Katsuya South Beach at the South Beach Hotel. Neither wanted the evening to end, so they headed to Hyde Beach for after-dinner drinks. “After that night, I knew there was something different about Brian,” said Ms. Valdes, who graduated from Cornell and received a master’s degree in public relations from the University of Florida. “I looked forward to seeing him again and getting to know him better.” The couple started dating regularly. They took several trips together and ultimately went to the Pacific Northwest to visit Mr. Skogen’s family. “I immediately loved them,” Ms. Valdes said. “They were so warm, welcoming and, well, normal.” “Brian and I shared a soft spot for hospitality so we quickly connected our professional experiences and interests, but our personal backgrounds and personalities couldn’t be any more different,” said Ms. Valdes, who now is a senior account director at RBB Communications in Coral Gables, Fla. “His colleagues and friends would agree that the most commonly used phrase from Brian is ‘Everything will be fine.’ I, on the other hand, typically need a Plan A, B, and C for any situation.” Ms. Valdes, who grew up in Miami, and Mr. Skogen, who grew up in Woodinville, Wash., and graduated from Eastern Washington University, said they “became a stronger team during the pandemic. Brian taught me how to be more patient and how important it is to take time to slow down and appreciate the little things. I feel so lucky to have him by my side.” In 2020, the couple decided to celebrate Valentine’s Day a day early and replay their first date. On Feb. 13, they had dinner at Katsuya, with after-dinner drinks at Hyde Beach. Not feeling as young as they did when they first met, they ended the night after one drink. As they were leaving, but still standing poolside at Hyde Beach, Mr. Skogen suddenly turned to Ms. Valdes and said, “You’re stuck with me.” He then placed a ring on her finger. She was in shock, but happy. With the future uncertain  , they decided to move forward with planning a wedding in early 2021. “We were ready,” Ms. Valdes said. And they were busy. In May 2020, Mr. Skogen also opened a new restaurant, MKT Kitchen in Coral Gables. He is a co-owner. They were married March 20 at the Church of Little Flower in Coral Gables with the Rev. Omar Ayubi, a Roman Catholic priest, leading the ceremony before 65 guests. (Guests were required to wear masks, and the reception had indoor and outdoor seating options.) Friends and family who could not attend tuned in via livestream on YouTube. “I was the first girl Brian ever brought home and introduced to his family,” Ms. Valdes said. “At the wedding, they shared that’s how they knew I was ‘the one.’ And my dad expressed his happiness of now having a son.” “The wedding was amazing,” the bride said. “I couldn’t have asked for a more perfect day and night.”"
How to Get Started With Tarot,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/style/self-care/tarot-guide-for-beginners.html,"People have been finding meaning in tarot cards for centuries, and though there is a lot of ritual to the practice, there is no evidence that tarot cards actually … tell your future. But for many who love to consult them, that’s beside the point. Tarot is less about predicting the future than it is about reflecting on your life. Also? “Having fun is more serious to the practice than you can imagine,” said Ariana Lenarsky, 34, a writer, musician and  . Getting into tarot can be overwhelming at first. Here’s an easy guide. STEP 1 There are a few key differences between a regular deck of cards and a tarot deck. Generally, tarot decks contain more cards, and each card features an illustration associated with its meaning. The decks have been reimagined many times with different styles and themes. The most important thing is that your tarot deck resonates with you: Buy a deck you’ll want to use and practice with. (Or, ask someone to buy a nice deck for you, if you feel superstitious about buying your own.) “My recommendation is always to think about a deck like you’re choosing a roommate,” said Jessica Dore, 34, a social worker and tarot card reader who is known for her daily readings   and now teaches tarot card reading. The reader behind a popular YouTube channel called   recommends visiting a local bookstore or metaphysical shop so you can see and hold a deck before buying it. If that’s not possible, you can always browse tarot decks online at retailers like  ,   and  . If you’re a beginner, it’s worth considering a deck that comes with a guidebook. Here are some suggested decks: The   tarot deck, originally published in 1909, is one of the most popular. It can make for a great beginner deck because it’s easy to   on how to interpret the cards. The   deck is a contemporary twist on the Rider Waite deck. The   deck showcases African spiritual practices. The   deck features cards with vibrant colors and detailed artwork. STEP 2 A tarot deck has 78 cards and is divided into two sections: major arcana (major mysteries) and minor arcana (meaning minor mysteries). There are 22 major arcana cards, and they tend to deal with big life events and overarching themes, for example, relationships, career and love. There are 56 minor arcana cards. These tend to deal with smaller issues and day-to-day tribulations, like fleeting emotions and situations. Minor arcana cards are divided into four suits: cups, wands, swords and pentacles. Each suit has numbered cards from 1 through 10, as well as four court cards (page, knight, king and queen). STEP 3 The aim of a tarot reading is to explore a question about the self. You pick cards to help you reflect on possible answers, interpreting the meaning of each in relation to what you asked. Keep in mind that tarot cards are tools for introspection, and for that reason it’s best to keep questions open-ended. “Any questions that are clear and concise that deal with who, what, where and how are great,” said Tatianna Morales, 33, who taught herself to read tarot cards as a child and now conducts a variety of services as  . “The whys are not so important, because things can change.” Though you can use tarot to work through the big things happening in your life, like career obstacles and relationship struggles, it can also address day-to-day questions. Here are some examples from the experts, of questions you can ask of yourself or to help answer for other people: STEP 4 Do whatever feels right to set the mood. Some people like to use specific table cloths while they read, while others use candles or crystals. Many tarot card readers also cleanse their area before they start. You can do this with sprays like lavender, as well as by burning incense. Here is a  STEP 5 Start by shuffling your deck while thinking about your question. Shuffle however feels most comfortable, and stop when you feel you’ve thought about your question enough and are ready for an answer. After shuffling, place the deck facedown and cut it into multiple smaller decks. They don’t have to be of equal size — just whatever feels right. Then, restack all of the decks back together at random. Your cards are now ready to pull: You’ll flip individual cards up from the deck and place them faceup on the table. Step 6 There are different ways to pull tarot cards. You pull them intuitively or into “spreads” — specific arrangement where each card is assigned a meaning. Bronx and Ms. Morales said they pull cards intuitively, flipping over cards until they feel they’ve answered their question. For beginners, spreads or specific forms of reading can be easier to grasp. The simplest of these is a one-card spread, where a single card is pulled. Pulling a single card at a time can be less overwhelming than a full spread, and it can give you the opportunity to get to know the cards better. Ms. Dore recommends pulling one card in the morning and one in the evening, creating opportunities to check in with yourself. Three-card spreads are easy and adaptable. You’ll pull three cards, placing them on the table from left to right. Assign each position a meaning: For example, the first card you pull can represent the past, the middle card can represent the present, and the last can look at the future. You could also look at mind, body and spirit; your current situation, your obstacle and advice; or any other meanings you want to assign. A Celtic cross is a 10-card spread that approaches an issue from multiple angles. The first card you pull looks at the heart of the issue, while the rest work to explain it and give you insight on the best way forward.   However, given the number of cards, it can be a little overwhelming if you’re not familiar with what they all mean yet. Step 7 First up, the minor arcana. Cups, associated with water, is the suit that deals primarily with emotions, openness and imagination. Wands, associated with fire and passion, represent energy, movement and creative force. Swords, associated with air, represent your mind; how you think, communicate and solve problems. Pentacles, associated with earth, explore the physical world and how we interact with it, representing topics like money, the home and careers. Next, the court cards. Just like in a regular deck of cards, each suit has face or court cards — usually called king, queen, page and knight. “You can think about them as individual entities that stand alone, or you can think about them as a sequence or a progression,” Ms. Dore said. The page and the knight can represent youth or inexperience, while the queen and king can convey adulthood and mastery. Major arcana cards, like the Star or the Lovers, refer to bigger events in your life. Though these cards can be intimidating at first, just make sure to take your time with them and read up on all the different ways they can be interpreted. They’re always more nuanced than they seem at a glance: For example, while pulling the Death card may feel like a bad omen, it could be interpreted more innocently — that something in your life could end. Keep a tarot journal. “Go with your own instincts, try to shut your brain off and write as much as you can about what you’re picking up for that card in that moment, and compile a list of definitions over time,” Ms. Morales said. “That list will become your own encyclopedia.”"
"Bible Study Brought Them to the Altar, Where They Shared Their First Kiss",style,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/fashion/weddings/houston-wedding.html,"If Nessa Egwuatu and Jordan Onuoha got more sympathy than most couples who have had weddings fall through recently, it may be because they had more people sympathizing. The couple initially had invited around 1,000 guests; the guest list shrunk first because of the coronavirus pandemic. The guest list for the Feb. 21 ceremony in Houston, further sidelined by weather, came to 350 people. , the Centers for Disease Control recommends that Americans   and  ; Texas has no restriction on gatherings. There was a sense of anticipation for the many who did attend. Though they have been a couple for years, Ms. Egwuatu and Mr. Onuoha let it be known that they have been waiting for their wedding day to have their first kiss. Ms. Egwuatu, 25, and Mr. Onuoha, 26, met in Nacogdoches, Texas, in 2014, as students at Stephen F. Austin State University, though their mothers knew of each other in Houston, where both grew up. The mothers “hung around the same Nigerian community,” Mr. Onuoha said. A display of Ms. Egwuatu’s Nigerian roots at the start of her freshman year helped acquaint her and Mr. Onuoha officially. One day that fall, she and her roommate, Ashley Eyo, wore matching dashikis. Mr. Onuoha, on one of his usual skateboarding jaunts across campus, took notice. “Not only were they wearing dashikis, they had painted polka dots on their faces, and Nessa’s hair was blue at the time,” he said. “I was like, OK, y’all are not just regular people. Y’all are Nigerians.” He wheeled over to introduce himself. Which by then had seemed inevitable to Ms. Egwuatu. “I kept seeing Jordan around campus,” she said. “I saw him so much that I started to feel like, man, I hope he doesn’t think I’m stalking him.” For reasons she can’t explain, Mr. Onuoha, then a sophomore, stood out. “It was like everybody around me had on a black shirt, and he had on a yellow shirt,” Ms. Egwuatu said. After his first words to Ms. Egwuatu, which were, “Are you Nigerian?” they established that both had ties to the country’s Igbo people. Their parents immigrated to the United States within a few years of each other, around 1980. The Egwuatus, Nwachinemelu Patricia and Akunne Sonny Sr., grew up together in Nigeria. “When they came to America to go to college they didn’t have a dime,” Ms. Egwuatu said. “But they always had each other’s backs.” Mr. Egwuatu died in 1999. Ms. Egwuatu is the youngest of four children. “My mom called me her miracle blessing baby,” she said. “The Lord knew my father would be passing in three years’ time and I was able to be there for her.” Her siblings, Brian, Michelle Atanu and Sonny Jr., are 10, 12 and 16 years older. Mr. Onuoha’s parents, Josephine Akudo Nwankpa and Chidi Chijoke Onuoha, also knew each other in Nigeria but came to the United States separately. In Houston, where both ended up, they hit it off immediately and married shortly after. There they raised him and an older brother, Alexander, and a younger sister, Audrey. If Nigerian culture was a touchstone for Ms. Egwuatu and Mr. Onuoha, it wasn’t the only influence on their childhoods. Ms. Egwuatu grew up speaking Urdu. “By the time I was born my family was fully invested in their own lives, so I had a Pakistani nanny who taught me Pakistani things,” she said. The nanny, Frazana Rahman, is now a close friend; Ms. Egwuatu and Ms. Rahman still speak regularly in Urdu. Mr. Onuoha’s family are Seventh-day Adventists, a Christian denomination he had misgivings about by the time he met Ms. Egwuatu. “It was very strict in its own way,” he said. “We went to church on Saturdays, and we couldn’t eat pork or shrimp. When I got to college, I started reading the Bible and got away from that doctrine.” But he remained devoted to a deeply spiritual life. Before he met Ms. Egwuatu, he and three friends had formed a Bible study group on campus. During the dashiki encounter, he invited Ms. Egwuatu and Ms. Eyo to join. Ms. Egwuatu was open to spiritual guidance at the time. “Going back to my nanny being Pakistani, I grew up being a little confused,” she said. “My family saw God and my nanny saw Allah, but they were both worshiping Jesus.” Through reading scripture in Mr. Onuoha’s nondenominational group, she said, “I surrendered my life to Him. I got so repentful looking at my past life.” She stopped wearing crop tops and cursing and broke her collection of rap CDs. For a while, she slept with a Bible, like she would a teddy bear. If Mr. Onuoha was her guide to a fuller sense of God, though, he wasn’t hers exclusively. “I was evangelizing to a lot of people at the time,” he said. A late 2014 outing to a McDonald’s restaurant near campus would help him understand the intensity of their connection. “I couldn’t put my guard up around her,” he said. He was so comfortable in her company that, as the night wore on and she started falling asleep across the table from him — McDonald’s was the local destination for studying after the school library closed at midnight — his playful side emerged. “I started drawing on her chin with a marker,” he said. “That’s not something I would have done with anybody but her. It was like we were already best friends.” They would remain best friends until 2018, when Mr. Onuoha said he was visited by a “voice.” In the spring of that year, “I was sleeping, and as soon as I woke up I heard it vividly, as if it were in the room with me,” he said. “It was a calm voice. It said, ‘Go get your wife.’ I believe it was God, of course.” He wasn’t entirely sure what to make of the command. “I knew I had to submit to it, but I was like, My wife? Could that be Nessa? That felt like a green light to me to move forward, like a prophecy.” For Ms. Egwuatu, re-evaluating the boundaries of their relationship wasn’t an idea out of left field. “By that time, everybody who knew us and even people we didn’t know would say things like, ‘Y’all should be together,’” she said. This included their families. Ms. Egwuatu met Mr. Onuoha’s mother on a visit to his house just before her sophomore year. “We became super close,” she said. “And my family knew all about Jordan because when they would call me, we were usually together.” In May 2018, both graduated from Stephen F. Austin; a change in majors had put Mr. Onuoha on the five-year program. Their graduation doubled as an announcement of their decision to become a couple. They posted a photo of themselves with the caption, “I love you,” on social media. No one told them they shouldn’t mark the occasion with a kiss. Friends and family actually encouraged them. “Even my mom was like, ‘You need to kiss that girl,’” Mr. Onuoha said. But Ms. Egwuatu and Mr. Onuoha made a promise to each other upon becoming boyfriend and girlfriend to limit their physical connection to holding hands. “It was our way of honoring ourselves and God,” Ms. Egwuatu added. “People would be like, ‘Y’all are too much friends, you need to add some spice.’ But we’re like, ‘It’s all right, we’ll make it.’” Ms. Egwuatu and Mr. Onuoha are speech therapists. After graduation, each moved home to Houston. Ms. Egwuatu works with children at Reliant Pediatric Home Health Services. Mr. Onuoha works with Houston Charter Schools. Mr. Onuoha started thinking about proposing. “Nessa’s older siblings are married and have kids, and they were such an example of what a mature relationship looks like,” he said. “It made me feel like boyfriend and girlfriend doesn’t really mean anything.” With the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, his urge to marry Ms. Egwuatu deepened. On June 20, 2020, he arranged a daylong scavenger hunt for her, with a final clue in a church parking lot. There, he presented an engagement ring before about 100 friends and family members. Ms. Egwuatu’s ecstatic yes did not end in a kiss or a hug. They held hands. Six days before their original Feb. 21 wedding date, a winter storm slammed into Texas. Out-of-town guests had to cancel flights. Then the couple got word that the warehouse storing their decorations had been flooded, and that because of widespread power outages, their wedding cake couldn’t be made and food for the 350-person reception was doomed to spoil. “Everything crumbled,” Ms. Egwuatu said. “It was like: bam, bam, bam.” Still sturdy, though, was their will to marry Texas style. On March 6, Ms. Egwuatu and Mr. Onuoha and their 350 guests, including 11 bridesmaids and 10 groomsmen, gathered at Houston’s Holy Trinity Cathedral for a retry.  The couple maintained that it was important for them to have a big wedding. Ms. Egwuatu was the last of her siblings to marry, while Mr. Onuoha was the first. “A big thing we said to multiple people is to not feel pressured on attending our wedding as we understood the current state of the world,” Ms. Egwuatu said. “Instead we provided comfort to those who were conflicted in their decision. It wasn’t about the numbers to us — our joy was never based on the outcome. However we ultimately wanted those who could, to celebrate the faithfulness of God with us and truly honor what He has called forth. For most, it was a moment they said a virus wouldn’t allow them to miss and for that we were grateful.” Gov. Greg Abbott had issued his executive order lifting the state’s mask mandate by the day of their wedding, but guests were still required to wear masks and sign a waiver indicating they were Covid-free. The event company behind the wedding, Dure Events, required temperature checks before the ceremony (though these are   of coronavirus illness), and made sure hand sanitizers were plentiful. Anthony Smith, a pastor at Houston’s Tabernacle of Meeting Church, performed the ceremony preceded by a demonstration of biblical humility. Instead of bouquets, the bridal party carried jugs of water to a towering altar draped in greenery and white flowers. Mr. Onuoha used the vessel in which the water was poured to wash Ms. Egwuatu’s feet. In handwritten vows, Ms. Egwuatu told Mr. Onuoha he had taught her patience, and to love fearlessly. “You are Jordan, the river that doesn’t run dry,” she said through tears. “You restore my soul,” Mr. Onuoha said. To hollers of “Amen!” from the crowd, he added, “I practice self control because of you.” As Pastor Smith pronounced them married, a hush of expectancy settled over the room. When the couple leaned toward each other, then pulled back, applause broke out. As they finally pressed their lips together and held each other tight, cheers and shouts erupted. Despite the commotion, neither was in a hurry for their first kiss to end.  March 6, 2021  Holy Trinity Cathedral, Houston  After the ceremony, guests drove to Signature Manor, a Housing wedding venue, for a cocktail hour and reception. The bride and groom made their debut as a married couple Jekalyn Carr’s “You Will Win.” When the party was over, they readied for a next-day honeymoon flight to Aruba.  Nathan Warner, a friend from college and one of the groomsmen, said the couple’s self-control when it came to intimacy before marriage has been a calling card. “It’s rare to find anything like it in this world,” he said. “But that’s Nessa and Jordan for you.”  A couple of weeks after the ceremony and reception, the couple followed up with guests to check on their health. “Yes we have followed up and have been getting good news all around,” Mr. Onuoha said. The couple said they are not aware of anyone contracting the virus.  Ms. Egwuatu donned a white strapless wedding gown with a sweetheart neckline, full skirt and dramatic train. Mr. Onuoha wore a white Nehru jacket over white trousers."
Mets-Nationals Series Is Postponed by Virus Outbreak,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/baseball/mets-nationals-coronavirus.html,"A day after pushing back the Mets’ season-opening game in Washington because of a coronavirus outbreak on the Nationals,   postponed the teams’ three-game weekend series on Friday. The league said it needed more time for follow-up testing and contact tracing after four Nationals players tested positive this week. The Mets now will play their first game of the season on Monday in Philadelphia, several hours after the Nationals are scheduled to host the Atlanta Braves. Baseball officials are hopeful that the Nationals will be cleared to play by then, as long as their players continue to test negative during the layoff. If the Nationals do start on Monday, their roster will be significantly compromised. The players who tested positive cannot return until at least 10 days from their positive tests, and those in close contact must miss at least seven days. The Nationals could fill those roster spots with players from their minor-league camp in Fredericksburg, Va. “We’re in crisis-management mode,” National General Manager Mike Rizzo said, adding later: “We have confidence in our depth. We like the players we have in Fredericksburg and we’re going to rely heavily on them.” Rizzo said the Nationals hoped to be cleared to work out at their ballpark on Saturday. The Mets practiced there on Friday and plan to do so again on Saturday and Sunday before leaving for Philadelphia, where Jacob deGrom will start Monday’s delayed season opener. “We know that we can make the adjustment,” Mets Manager Luis Rojas said. “We want to play this weekend, but there’s an unfortunate situation here. I shared our sympathy with the Nationals. It could happen to anybody.” Rizzo said he did not believe the Nationals’ players had violated protocols, but the team was still trying to determine how their players were infected. “A virus is a virus, it’s very contagious, so I think that it could happen in many, many different ways,” he said. “I don’t think it’s a breach of protocols or inadequate protocols, it’s just something that happened and we’re going to try to find out how it happened, investigate it and see if we can stop it from happening again.” For M.L.B., last summer’s outbreaks on  and  highlighted the importance of contact tracing to containing the spread of the virus. Players are given wearable devices now to help identify close contacts. Baseball officials said on Friday that the league had conducted 14,354 tests in the past week, with only four positives — three Nationals players and one staff member who is not with the Nationals — through Thursday. A fourth Washington player tested positive on Friday. Rizzo said one of the players has had a fever but was recovering. “He’s feeling much better, close to normal,” Rizzo said of the player, whom he did not identify. “And the other players feel fine, they have no symptoms.” Since the start of spring training, M.L.B. said that it has administered 92,896 tests — counting monitoring and intake testing — and found 38 total positives (28 players and 10 staff members), for a positive rate of 0.04 percent."
U.C.L.A. Is Trying to Send Gonzaga Back to ‘Heartbreak City’,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/ncaabasketball/ucla-gonzaga-sweet-16.html,"Ryan Hollins wanted to share a message for his U.C.L.A. Bruins on the eve of their Final Four matchup against Gonzaga. “Because of what we did and the success that we had, Mark Few is going to try and put those boys in the dirt,” Hollins said. “They better have their hard hats ready, because they’ve inherited a rivalry that they don’t even know they’re stepping into, to be honest.” Hollins played center on the U.C.L.A. team that engineered one of the most remarkable N.C.A.A. men’s tournament comebacks in the last generation. In 2006, U.C.L.A. frantically and improbably erased a   against Gonzaga in the regional semifinals, a rally that ended Adam Morrison’s storied college career. In the aftermath of the game, Darren Collison, then a U.C.L.A. guard, said he had no words to describe what had happened. That sentiment rings true 15 years later. “I’m still speechless to this day,” Collison said Thursday. “That whole entire game, things weren’t going well for us for up until the last five or so minutes.” Few coached Gonzaga then and now. Hollins played under Few at the Pan American Games in 2015. “He was still very aware, very aware of what had happened in that comeback and that they shouldn’t have let it happen,” Hollins said. That U.C.L.A. team relied on mental toughness and adhering to the principles of Ben Howland, the head coach. The second-seeded Bruins planned to trap Morrison and run Derek Raivio off the 3-point line. But they found a team just as resilient in Gonzaga, seeded third. Morrison started like the all-American he was and wore out Arron Afflalo, U.C.L.A.’s primary wing defender. “Adam Morrison was going to the line, talking trash, saying splash,” Hollins said. Morrison and Afflalo got into it at one point. “Arron throws him to the floor, and we always joke, Arron goes full Compton right there.” The Bruins switched guard Cedric Bozeman onto Morrison. “I felt like I had been there before,” Bozeman said. “I was a fifth-year senior at the time. I think I had seen everything, to be quite honest. My whole thing wasn’t about Adam Morrison. It was just pretty much about doing my job and using my length.” U.C.L.A. trailed, 42-29, at halftime. They were missing the “easiest shots,” Collison said. Later, people told Hollins that they turned off their television at about that time. The Bruins, though, were just warming up. “It got to the point where it wasn’t even in Ben Howland’s hands,” Hollins said. “It was about us.” U.C.L.A. made inroads early in the second half and trailed by 9 points with about three minutes remaining. “In the moment, you are never giving up, and you focus on keep fighting to the end and staying together, going through the process that it takes to pull something like that off,” said Jordan Farmar, a starting guard. Forward Luc Richard Mbah a Moute’s put-back brought the score to 71-66 with just over two minutes left. Gonzaga center J.P. Batista’s foul sent Hollins to the free-throw line with 19.7 seconds left and the Bruins down by 3. Hollins, shooting about 60 percent from the line for the season, converted both of his one-and-one free throws to bring U.C.L.A. within a point. “I was blacked out,” Hollins said. “For some odd reason, normally you stare at the rim. I remember staring at the entire backboard.” Farmar stole the ball from Batista as Gonzaga tried to get possession over the half-court line and quickly delivered a crisp pass to Mbah a Moute for the go-ahead bucket. Mbah a Moute clinched the win by diving and knocking the ball away as Gonzaga’s Raivio hurriedly tried to answer. “The only way that a guy 6-foot-8 steals the ball from a guy 6 feet tall without fouling him is to literally run and slide on the floor like he’s a rock band musician coming in onstage,” Hollins said. “He runs full speed and slides and grabs the ball. It’s insane.” The Bruins had scored the game’s final 11 points. “HEART … BREAK … CITY,” the announcer Gus Johnson memorably   after Mbah a Moute’s dive. Once the buzzer sounded, Hollins went to Morrison, who had shot 10 for 17 but missed his final four shots. “Because he was crying, I wanted him to know how amazing he was and to never drop his head because he had a huge future ahead of him,” Hollins said. Hollins and Bozeman then held their hands up. Hollins noticed the eerie quiet inside the Oakland Arena. “They didn’t know how to react,” Hollins said. “Our fans didn’t know to cheer. Their fans didn’t know what in the world just happened. And all of a sudden, the whole arena erupts.” U.C.L.A. fell to Florida in the championship game. The visit was the first of three consecutive Final Four appearances and a renaissance of the storied program, which has won 11 N.C.A.A. championships over all. “Just to remember yourself as a child, watching March Madness and seeing all those legendary moments and wanting to be a part of it,” Farmar said, “and then actually having that opportunity and then 15 years past that moment, people are still talking about how that was the best game they’ve ever witnessed or whatever everybody’s own personal anecdotal evidence or experience, it’s pretty special.” Hollins, Farmar, Collison, Mbah a Moute and Afflalo all carved out lengthy N.B.A. careers. Hollins directly traces his professional success to the Gonzaga game. “I’m definitely not who I am today, literally, without that game,” he said. “That game meant so much more because losing in the Sweet 16 versus making it to that next weekend, that’s everything. You only get defined in college basketball by winning in March Madness, sadly so. You can be a memorable team, but making that second weekend, that is everything. I’d probably go undrafted.” Gonzaga extracted some revenge by beating U.C.L.A. in the Sweet 16 in 2015. The schools have never met this deep into the tournament. This Final Four matchup presents a different kind of matchup for the West Coast’s premier men’s basketball programs. Gonzaga, undefeated and the tournament’s top overall seed, is chasing perfection. The Bulldogs breezed to the Final Four, crushing U.S.C. in the Elite Eight. Their closest result was a 16-point win over Oklahoma in the second round of the tournament. U.C.L.A. trailed Michigan State late in a First Four matchup before beating B.Y.U., Abilene Christian, Alabama and squeezing past Michigan to qualify for the Final Four. Labeling U.C.L.A. as an underdog may be an understatement. Gonzaga is a 14-point favorite, the largest Final Four spread since 1985 when the tournament expanded to 64 teams. “The team is similar to ours in the fact both teams are very scrappy,” Bozeman said. “This team has crawled their way all the way from the first game to now. They played Alabama in a close game. We played Alabama in a close game, and now they get to play Gonzaga. It’s like history. “Hopefully history can repeat itself.”"

Tsubasa Kajitani Wins Augusta National Women’s Amateur in Playoff,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/sports/golf/golf-augusta-women-amateur.html,"AUGUSTA, Ga. — The first Augusta National Women’s Amateur in 2019 featured a closing charge by the eventual winner, Jennifer Kupcho, who faced down the intimidating back nine by playing her final six holes in five under par. While the tournament was canceled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, this year’s edition proved, like so many of the Masters tournaments, that Augusta National is often the setting for drama and unpredictable outcomes. For most of Saturday’s final round, it appeared that Rose Zhang, a 17-year-old Californian, was going to claim a narrow victory in the 54-hole event with her steady, poised play. Zhang, who began the day tied for the lead after the first two rounds at the nearby Champions Retreat Golf Club, suddenly stumbled on Saturday with a triple bogey on the treacherous 13th hole. But Zhang then rallied to become one of six golfers tied for the lead with only a handful of holes left to play. For the next hour, the players jockeyed for the lead on the famed Augusta National layout in familiar, if fickle, ways — stunning recoveries under pressure, deft short-game play, steely-eyed putts and the occasional flub. In a surprise ending, after a one-hole playoff, it was a different 17-year-old, Tsubasa Kajitani of Japan, who came from behind to win the tournament. No Asian player has won the Masters, which was first contested in 1934. Asked how it felt to be the first player from Japan to win a tournament at Augusta National, Kajitani, who came off the final green with tears running down her cheeks, said through an interpreter that it was “a dream come true.” After 18 holes on Saturday, Kajitani and Emilia Migliaccio, a senior and an all-American golfer at Wake Forest University, were tied at one over par, one stroke ahead of six players from five countries who tied at two over. Both players hit their tee shots into the 18th fairway to start the playoff, but each was slightly out of position after wayward approach shots. Migliaccio had an exceedingly difficult chip over a bunker to a green sloping away from her, and Kajitani had to putt down the same unnerving slope from 45 feet away. Kajitani’s task proved less daunting, although she had to sink a 5-foot par putt to clinch her victory. Kajitani, who is from Okayama, Japan, did not play in the   in 2019 at Augusta National, although she won the Japan Junior Championship that year. She was second at the 2019 Australian Women’s Amateur and played in three other events on the LPGA of Japan Tour. “I have played in many other tournaments,” Kajitani said. “But you can’t really compare those to this tournament.” Migliaccio played Saturday with her mother, Ulrika, who was a top collegiate golfer at the University of Arizona, acting as her caddie, making the duo the first mother-daughter pair to compete at Augusta National. That partnership made the closing round especially memorable for Migliaccio, who has decided not to pursue a professional golf career. “It was so fun; it was so special,” Migliaccio said Saturday evening. “That’s all I wanted to do. I really wanted to enjoy this moment with my mom, and this is probably one of the last times she’s going to caddie for me, and it was just a joy to be out there.” She added: “I’m not going to turn professional and I’m really happy with my decision. Golf has taken me so far. It’s allowed me to played Augusta National, which I wouldn’t have dreamed of when I started playing.” After starting Saturday’s round two strokes off the lead, Kajitani appeared to have botched her chance at winning when she needed four strokes from the front of the 17th green to get her ball in the hole for a double bogey. Kajitani conceded that she had hit two nervous shots at the 17th hole, but she then turned her focus to the closing hole. Kajitani, who hit 79 percent of her tee shots in the fairway during the tournament, found a bunker on the left side of the fairway on the 18th hole. An attempt to hit a challenging uphill shot to the green came up considerably short. But her pitch from about 50 yards nearly spun back into the hole for birdie. A sturdy par was enough get her into the playoff with Migliaccio. Zhang, who began the final round tied with Ingrid Lindblad of Sweden, was comfortably in the lead at one under until a series of mishaps at the 13th hole, where she had to take two penalty strokes for errant shots. The trouble began when Zhang hooked her tee shot toward the hazard on the left side of the hole. When the ball was not found, Zhang had to hit a second shot from the 13th tee. Her fourth shot on the hole ended up in the water hazard protecting the green. After chipping onto the green, she two-putted for a triple bogey. Zhang recovered with a birdie on the 14th hole to rejoin the gaggle in the lead, although a bogey at the 17th ultimately left her one stroke behind Kajitani and Migliaccio. Still, she was pleased. “To handle the pressure of just being on television and playing at Augusta National, I think says a lot,” Zhang said."
What to Watch For in the Men’s Final Four,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/ncaabasketball/what-time-is-final-four.html,"The Final Four of the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament in Indianapolis features two No. 1 seeds that many people had projected to reach this stage in their brackets, a No. 2 seed that had flown under the radar nationally for much of the season and a perennial blue blood seeded No. 11 that virtually no one expected to still be standing. No. 1 Baylor will face No. 2 Houston in an all-Texas showdown at 5:14 p.m. Eastern time on Saturday at Lucas Oil Stadium, while the No. 1 overall seed, Gonzaga, will meet No. 11 U.C.L.A. at 8:34 p.m. Here’s what to watch for: The Bulldogs (30-0) stand on the doorstep of history, but they haven’t made it their obsession. With two more wins, Coach Mark Few’s club would become the first undefeated national champion in men’s basketball since Indiana in 1976. With victories Saturday and Monday, Gonzaga would finish at 32-0, the same mark that the Hoosiers put up 45 years ago. “We’re not hung up on the undefeated thing at all,” Few told reporters after his squad dismantled No. 5-seeded Creighton, 83-65, in the round of 16 on Sunday. “We’ve got to go 3-0 if we want to win the championship, and that’s been our goal all along. Pressure is on all these teams as you get farther and farther along with this. Pressure comes from all kinds of places, and the biggest pressure of all is you just don’t want it to end.” The two previous teams to get this far while undefeated — U.N.L.V. in 1991 and Kentucky in 2015 — both lost in the national semifinals. Gonzaga does not appear to be in danger of following suit. The Bulldogs feature three players on the ballot for the Naismith Trophy as the nation’s best college player: Corey Kispert, Drew Timme and Jalen Suggs. Their fourth best player, Joel Ayayi, owns the only triple-double in program history. The Bulldogs have won their first four tournament games by a combined 96 points. “I’ve loved every part of this journey, and we’re not done yet,” Suggs said in a television interview after Gonzaga smashed Southern California, 85-66, in the round of 8 on Tuesday. Coach Mick Cronin’s team is just the second ever, after Virginia Commonwealth in 2011, to advance to the Final Four from the First Four. The Bruins have won five straight games in this tournament — including victories over No. 1-seeded in Michigan and No. 2-seeded in Alabama — after losing four consecutive games before the tournament. Yet the Bruins (22-9) will enter the national semifinals as a historic underdog, with many major betting sites listing Gonzaga as a 14-point favorite. The Bruins are said to be the biggest underdogs in a Final Four game in 25 years. “They’re going to have to keep it close and put game pressure on them somehow,” said Arizona State Coach Bobby Hurley, who, as a player helped Duke knock off U.N.L.V. in the national semifinals in 1991 before winning the championship. “Gonzaga’s been able to build big leads on teams that have been insurmountable.” One crucial matchup to watch will be Gonzaga’s Timme against U.C.L.A. center Cody Riley. The 6-foot-10 Timme excelled against U.S.C.’s Evan and Isaiah Mobley in the Elite Eight en route to 23 points, 5 rebounds and 4 assists. The 6-foot-9 Riley, a junior averaging 9.8 points and 5.2 rebounds per game, will have to find a way to make life difficult for Timme, who loves to pass from the post to open teammates on the perimeter. Coach Scott Drew and the Bears (26-2) are appearing in the program’s first Final Four since 1950 and are seeking to make their first championship game since 1948. They enter as a 5-point favorite over Houston (28-3). Baylor was the No. 2 team in the nation for much of the season and may be best equipped to challenge Gonzaga should it reach the final because it features a group of talented and experienced perimeter players in Jared Butler, MaCio Teague, Davion Mitchell, Adam Flagler and Matthew Mayer. The backcourt matchup will be crucial. Houston holds opponents to 28.3 percent shooting from behind the 3-point arc, while Baylor’s 41.1 percent clip from deep leads Division I. Since a pause because of virus protocols and a loss to Kansas in late February, the Bears are 8-1 and appear to be playing at the same level as when they began the season 18-0. “We felt we had to diagnose some things, correct some things going forward,” Teague said of the Kansas loss. “And we felt like we would continue to get better as the season went on, and we didn’t want to peak in January. We want to peak at the time we’re peaking right now. We want to continue to get better even going into this last week.” DeJon Jarreau, Quentin Grimes, Marcus Sasser and the rest of the Cougars had not been born when Houston’s Phi Slama Jama teams, coached by Guy Lewis, reached three straight Final Fours from 1982 to ’84. Led by Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler, the Cougars lost in the 1983 final to the North Carolina State team coached by Jim Valvano and then to Patrick Ewing and Georgetown a year later. Houston — now featuring Jarreau, a New Orleans native who began his career at UMass; Grimes, who transferred from Kansas; and the sharpshooting Sasser, a Texas native like Grimes — has won 11 straight games dating to Feb. 18. “I’m happy to bring that excitement back to Houston and continue what the Phi Slama Jama did,” Jarreau said."
Gary Sanchez Homers Again as Yankees Top Blue Jays,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/sports/baseball/yankees-blue-jays.html,"Gary Sanchez joined Elston Howard in 1963 as the only Yankees catchers to homer in each of the first two games of the season and Jay Bruce blooped a two-run single in the seventh for his first hit with his new team in the Yankees’ 5-3 win over the Toronto Blue Jays on Saturday. Two-time Cy Young Award winner Corey Kluber, limited by injuries to one inning in the previous two seasons, pitched around control problems to allow one earned run over four innings in his Yankees debut. Left-hander Lucas Luetge also made his first major league appearance in six years. Chad Green got Rowdy Tellez to swing under a 96 mile-per-hour pitch to strand two on in the eighth and got a four-out save in the absence of Aroldis Chapman, who completed a two-game suspension for throwing near the head of Tampa Bay’s Mike Brousseau last Sept. 1. A sellout crowed of 10,107 — capacity was limited to 20 percent under New York State coronavirus restrictions — was noticeably louder than during Thursday’s 3-2, 10-inning loss. Brett Gardner, a 37-year-old fan favorite, got loud cheers when he replaced Clint Frazier in left field to start the eighth. Pitching in long sleeves on a 44-degree afternoon, Kluber threw 37 pitches in the first two innings, more than double his 18 last season. His 2019 season ended that May 1 when hit on the forearm by a comebacker, and his debut for Texas in the 2020 season lasted just one inning when he tore a muscle in his right shoulder on July 26. Winner of the 2014 and 2017 Cy Young awards for Cleveland, Kluber is a right-hander who turns 35 next Saturday and is seeking to re-establish himself with the Yankees, who gave him an $11 million, one-year deal. He struggled with his control, allowing three walks, five hits and costly wild pitch in four-plus innings with five strikeouts. The Yankees’ defense helped him by turning double plays in the first two innings. Called “Klubot” for his reserved, robot-like manner, he is among three Yankees starters coming off long layoffs. Domingo German starts Sunday in his first appearance since Sept. 18, 2019,   under Major League Baseball’s domestic violence policy. Jameson Taillon will start on Wednesday against Baltimore after   that had sidelined him since May 1, 2019, and required his second Tommy John surgery. Kluber’s 11 fastballs topped at 90.7 m.p.h., and he mixed in 22 in curveballs, 20 sinkers, 15 cutters and six changeups. Toronto’s Ross Stripling, starting because of injuries to Robbie Ray, Nate Pearson and Thomas Hatch, allowed three runs, seven hits and two walks in three and a third innings with five strikeouts. A.L. batting champion D.J. LeMahieu legged out a two-out infield hit in the second that allowed Gio Urshela to come home from third, but Toronto tied the score in the third with a pair of walks a wild pitch followed by Sánchez bouncing a throw into center for an error as Marcus Semien stole second for the second time. Sanchez homered for a 2-1 lead in the fourth, and Tyler Chatwood entered with two on and allowed singles on consecutive pitches to Aaron Judge and Aaron Hicks. Hick had a run-scoring hit off the glove of a diving Semien at second. Hicks also has struck out three times each in consecutive games for the first time in his nine-season career. Rafael Dolis walked the based loaded in the seventh, left-hander Tim Wayza relieved and Bruce, New York’s first baseman while Luke Voit recovers from knee surgery, plopped a sinker 234 feet into left field in front of Lourdes Gurriel Jr."

,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/style/dish-towel-tote-bag.html,"DESIGNER D.I.Y. SERIES Laura and Kate Mulleavy show us how to turn kitchen towels and costume jewelry into a carry-all. Dish towels have never seemed so important or ubiquitous as they have during these weeks of lockdown. But they are even more multipurpose than you might expect, or so say Kate and Laura Mulleavy of Rodarte. The sisters are known for their imagination and ability to find beauty in unexpected places. “We are all stuck at home, but even if you are just hauling laundry from one room to another, it makes you feel better to be able to put stuff away in something that cheers you up,” Laura Mulleavy said. “We have so many dish towels around and are always in need of reusable totes that we can also use as storage.” So they decided to make one out of a dish towel and some costume jewelry. Here’s how you can, too. STEP 1 Fold your chosen dish towel in half so that the inside is on the outside. STEP 2 Create a bottom. At the fold, measure two inches on each side, vertically. Mark and draw a line from one dot to the other. Then flatten the lower part of the folded towel so that it makes a T-shape perpendicular to the body, four inches across. This will become the “bottom” of the tote. STEP 3 Sew each side of the flattened part together with a straight stitch half an inch from each edge so that the sides of the T are closed. This will form a V-shaped notch at the bottom of the towel. If looked at from the side, it will resemble a Y. STEP 4 Sew each side together with a straight stitch, vertically from the bottom of the V to the upper end of the folded towel. Invert the bag and press the bottom open to make a floor. STEP 5 Make the sides. Measure a quarter of an inch from each side seam and straight stitch vertically from the top around the bottom and up the other side to create a soft rectangular side that will turn the sac into a box shape. STEP 6 Fold each necklace in half. STEP 7 Cut a ribbon in four pieces, each piece four inches long. Loop each ribbon through each of the four ends in the two lengths of necklace, bringing the ends of the ribbon together. STEP 8 Measure to the center of the upper, open rim of the bag. Then measure three and a half inches from there in either direction and mark those spots. That is where the loops, or the two ends of the handles, will go. STEP 9 Secure the loops to the bag at two stitch points, the upper one one-eighth of an inch from the top edge of the bag, the lower one one-eighth of an inch from the bottom of the loop ribbon. STEP 10 Put bag over your arm and go! Photograph via Rodarte"

The Title Race Is Over. The Fight for the Top Four Starts Now.,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/soccer/premier-league-champions-league-places.html,"Here, then, is the home straight of the Premier League season, the final quarter of a campaign that was heralded as the most chaotic, and least predictable, of them all. At times, throughout autumn and into winter, the combination of empty stadiums, a packed schedule and a frantic pace seemed destined to usurp the established order. Contenders seemed to rise and fall every week. Earnest conversations were held about whether Aston Villa   or if Arsenal was  . It did not, it turns out, quite come to pass. It soon became clear that Manchester City — the team with the best and biggest squad, the side with the brightest coach — would be champion while spring was still fresh in the air. Pep Guardiola’s team sat 14 points clear of Manchester United entering this weekend, its fingers already brushing a third crown in four years. Relegation, too, is largely settled. Sheffield United and West Bromwich Albion will be playing in the Championship next season; all that remains to be decided is whether Fulham can muster enough momentum to condemn Newcastle, drifting and directionless, to a place alongside them. In that relative certainty, the Premier League is something of an outlier across Europe’s major leagues. Elsewhere, the curious circumstances of the pandemic season do seem to have had an effect. In Spain, Barcelona and Real Madrid are slowly reeling in a stuttering Atlético Madrid. In Italy, Inter Milan had six points on its city rival, A.C. Milan, and 10 on Juventus and Atalanta entering Saturday’s matches. But with at least one fairly spectacular choke in fans’ relatively recent memory, that is not yet a gap broad enough to permit any comfort. In Germany, the title race may effectively be decided this weekend, when Bayern Munich traveled to RB Leipzig on Saturday knowing that victory will all but see off its last remaining challenger. A couple hours earlier, the top two teams in France were set to meet, though neither   nor Paris St.-Germain is in a position to deliver a decisive blow. Lyon and a resurgent Monaco are within touching distance of both, four teams separated by four points. In the absence of questions at the top and bottom of the table, the Premier League has concentrated all of its drama, jeopardy and intrigue into the jostling for position immediately below Manchester City. There are three more spots available in the Champions League for next season and seven teams with a realistic shot at one of them. Some are fallen giants, teams desperate to salvage something from a bitterly disappointing season. Others are surprise packages, those teams that have best adapted to the strangeness of this season. It is at this point that the consequences of all the chaos and unpredictability of the last seven months are made flesh, and it is a race that is all but impossible to sort — at least not yet. “It will go until the last day,” Carlo Ancelotti, the Everton manager, said last month. The challenge, he said, is to make sure you are still in contention by then. A glance at   would indicate that two of the seven Champions League contenders — Manchester United and Leicester City — have a considerable advantage. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s United has an eight-point lead on West Ham, currently the first team outside the places in fifth. Brendan Rodgers’s Leicester side has a seven-point cushion. But in Leicester’s case, certainly, that head start could yet be canceled out by the fact that its remaining schedule is considerably steeper than some of its rivals’. Leicester had to face Manchester City this weekend before traveling to West Ham. Three of its final four games are against direct rivals for a spot in the top four: trips to Manchester United and Chelsea, and a home game against Tottenham. Rodgers’s team surrendered a place in the top four on the final day last season; this year’s calendar brings with it the ghost of past regrets. No other team has quite such an arduous finish to the campaign, though Chelsea is close. The extent of Thomas Tuchel’s impact at Stamford Bridge will be gauged by visits to West Ham and Manchester City, and looming home games against Arsenal and Leicester. If the calendar is kindest to anyone, it is Liverpool, marooned in seventh after a dismal run since late December. That may prove scant solace for a team that has spent the last three months losing at home to Fulham, Brighton and Burnley, but it at least gives Jürgen Klopp’s side a slim chance of returning to Europe. A win over Arsenal will raise those hopes even more. If anything has marked this season, it is the capriciousness of crisis. It is barely two weeks since José Mourinho   his Tottenham players of being unable to display “the basics of football and the basics of life” during a humiliation at the hands of Dinamo Zagreb in the Europa League. Now he may wonder if being out of that competition is not such a bad thing. Nine league games remain of Spurs’ season, and Mourinho must also make room for the Carabao Cup final on April 24. But, that aside, he has a clear run. So, too, do West Ham and Everton. Leicester has one extra game than its rivals — an F.A. Cup semifinal — but the rest have more demanding commitments to juggle. Chelsea, for one, is still fighting on three fronts: An F.A. Cup semifinal against Manchester City beckons, as well as a two-legged Champions League quarterfinal with F.C. Porto. Should Chelsea reach the final of both competitions, it would have to play almost twice as many games as some of its rivals. Liverpool has a Champions League quarterfinal, too — a more arduous pairing, against Real Madrid — and Manchester United will be expected to reach the final of the Europa League, adding another five games to its schedule. At the end of a season that has been particularly demanding, the strain of any added workload to tired legs may prove crucial. That injury has proved a defining factor in the outcome of this Premier League season is neither surprising nor particularly debatable. The root of Liverpool’s collapse lies in its loss of its central defense; Leicester’s form stuttered with the absence, at various times, of Jamie Vardy, James Maddison and Harvey Barnes, among others; Everton’s results dipped when James Rodríguez was missing. It would be reasonable, then, to assume that the next two months will be decided by  , particularly to their key players. Liverpool, of course, is still missing Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez and Joel Matip. Tottenham is without Son Heung-min. Leicester is without Barnes, Maddison and James Justin, while Manchester United is sweating on Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood and Anthony Martial. Injuries can, of course, be sheer misfortune — a bad tackle, a mistimed movement — but they can also be cumulative, the effect of a player pushed too far into what Arsène Wenger used to call the “ .” But that is not the only consequence of fatigue. Even if injury is avoided, performance can dip. It is this, more than anything, that should give Solskjaer and Manchester United pause. United’s captain, Harry Maguire, has played 3,946 minutes this season entering the weekend, an order of magnitude greater than every other outfield player in England. He has played the equivalent of five full games more this season than his nearest rival, Leicester’s Youri Tielemans. But Maguire is not alone. United has seven players who have played more than 2,700 minutes this season. Leicester and Everton have only one, Chelsea two, and Spurs and West Ham three. Even Liverpool, its options reduced because of all those injuries, has only five. If fatigue does prove to be a factor, the core of United’s side is more likely to be afflicted in the final stretch than anyone else. To some extent, of course, that is offset by its resources: Solskjaer has options should any of his key players be sidelined or suffer an alarming drop in form. Having to play Donny van de Beek because Bruno Fernandes needs a rest should be no great sacrifice. Indeed, that may well be the formula, more than any other, that comes to define the next two months, that serves to find the signal in the noise of this season. More than in any other season, the final prize on offer in the Premier League will go to the teams that can best minimize the effects of fatigue, thanks to a reduced workload or by possessing the strength in depth to ride it out. In all the chaos, in the end, there will be some sort of order."
M.L.B. Pulls All-Star Game From Georgia in Response to Voting Law,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/us/politics/mlb-all-star-game-moved-atlanta-georgia.html,"Major League Baseball sent a warning shot on Friday to Republicans considering new laws to restrict voting, pulling its summer All-Star game out of suburban Atlanta in a rebuke to Georgia’s   that will make it harder to vote in the state’s urban areas. The announcement by the baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred, came after   from civil rights groups and discussions with stakeholders like the Major League Baseball Players Association. The action is likely to put additional pressure on other organizations and corporations to consider pulling business out of Georgia, a move that both Republicans and Democrats in the state oppose despite fiercely disagreeing about the new voting law. The league’s decision comes as other states are moving closer to passing new laws that would further restrict voting. In Texas, the State Senate   that would limit early voting hours, ban drive-through voting, add restrictions to absentee voting, and make it illegal for local election officials to mail absentee ballot applications to voters, even if they qualify. In Florida, the State Legislature has introduced a bill that would severely limit drop boxes.  A fight is now intensifying over the Texas bill: American Airlines and Dell Technologies this week voiced their opposition to the legislation, taking stands that major companies in Georgia like Delta and Coca-Cola declined to do until after the law there was passed. Michael Dell, the chief executive of the Texas-based company that bears his name, said on Thursday that “free, fair, equitable access to voting is the foundation of American democracy” and noted that “those rights — especially for women, communities of color — have been hard-earned.” Republicans have shrugged off that criticism so far. Mr. Manfred’s decision to move the All-Star Game goes far beyond what any other leading American institution has done so far to take a stand against new voting restrictions, and his strongly worded announcement was striking for a league with owners who span the political spectrum. “Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box,” Mr. Manfred said in a statement. “Fair access to voting continues to have our unwavering support.” The law in Georgia,   by Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, was the first major bill of voting restrictions to be passed in a battleground state since the 2020 election. It added new identification requirements for absentee voting, limited the use of drop boxes, granted more authority over elections   and made it a misdemeanor for groups to offer food or water to voters waiting in line near polling places. This week, President Biden   because of the voting law, which he and civil rights groups predicted would have  .  The league said it was finalizing details about new locations for this year’s All-Star Game, which was scheduled for July 13, and the draft. Before the announcement, baseball had faced the unsettling prospect of celebrating an All-Star week dedicated to the  , a Black pioneer of the game who broke Babe Ruth’s home run record, against the backdrop of a Georgia elections overhaul widely seen as targeting Black voters. Mr. Kemp, who has been forcefully defending the law in television appearances this week, criticized the decision to move the All-Star Game and tried to pin the blame on state Democrats for their vocal criticism of the voting restrictions.  “Today, Major League Baseball caved to fear, political opportunism, and liberal lies,” Mr. Kemp said in a statement, calling out Mr. Biden and Stacey Abrams, the titular head of the state’s Democrats. He continued: “I will not back down. Georgians will not be bullied. We will continue to stand up for secure, accessible, fair elections.” Georgia Democrats had not called for a boycott of the game, but were building pressure on Major League Baseball and Georgia-based corporations to oppose the state’s voting law. Ms. Abrams, who ran against Mr. Kemp for governor in 2018 and may challenge him again next year, said Friday that she was “disappointed” league officials had pulled the All-Star Game but that she was “ .”  For now, the fallout from baseball’s decision is more political and civic than financial. The impact on the Georgia economy of losing the All-Star Game is minimal, said Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College, because most of the tickets would be sold locally and many of the typical festivities would most likely be canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.  But, Professor Zimbalist said, Major League Baseball is taking a risk with a move that could alienate conservative fans. After the country’s top professional basketball and football leagues embraced the Black Lives Matter movement last year, they faced organized boycotts from conservatives, though the effort ultimately had little effect. And baseball’s fan base is   and   than basketball’s or football’s. “There will be a backlash,” Professor Zimbalist said. “I doubt very much that progressive people who didn’t like baseball will start liking baseball, but it’s quite possible that conservative people who do like baseball will move away from it.” On Friday night, former President Donald J. Trump tried to push them in that direction, calling for a boycott of Major League Baseball and “all of the woke companies” that he said were wading into the election process. After Mr. Kemp signed the Georgia bill into law last week, Mr. Manfred began talking by phone to owners, team and league executives, and current and former players, according to a baseball official familiar with the discussions. Among those Mr. Manfred spoke with were Tony Clark, the head of the baseball players’ union, and the Players Alliance,   and now includes more than 150 current and former Black professional baseball players. Mr. Manfred listened to what everyone had to say and deliberated — relocating the All-Star game three months before it is scheduled to happen is a large undertaking — before making his decision on Friday, the official said. There was no official vote among owners. While the National Basketball Association and the N.C.A.A., which governs college sports, have taken some progressive stands in the past — both groups moved major events out of North Carolina after Republicans there enacted a “bathroom ban” on transgender people — baseball has rarely made a political statement as significant as moving its midsummer classic out of Georgia. Many of Major League Baseball’s owners are conservative donors, the league has had a reputation for being slow-moving and traditional, and the majority of its players are white, with Black players now filling only 8 percent of roster spots. The Associated Press in 2017   had it not repealed its law. Once state lawmakers repealed it, the N.B.A. awarded Charlotte  .  Before baseball’s announcement, top Georgia Democrats had publicly opposed boycotts of their state over the Republican voting law, instead urging companies to fight against it and calling on Congress to pass   that could override parts of the Georgia law.  Senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat elected in a January runoff election, said companies upset about the law should “stop any financial support to Georgia’s Republican Party.”  Senator Raphael Warnock, a fellow Democrat from the state who faces re-election in 2022, blamed the state’s Republicans. “It is not the people of Georgia or the workers of Georgia who crafted this law,” he said. “It is politicians seeking to retain power at the expense of Georgians’ voices. And today’s decision by M.L.B. is the unfortunate consequence of these politicians’ actions.”  At least one Georgia Democrat, State Representative Teri Anulewicz, whose Cobb County district includes the Braves’ stadium, expressed disappointment that the state would no longer host the game. Georgia Republicans have scoffed at the prospect of boycotts. David Ralston, the State House speaker, told reporters that when Coca-Cola objected to the law after its passage,  , an act of heresy in Coke-dominated Atlanta. Mr. Biden, in a television interview   before baseball’s opening day on Thursday, said he would “strongly support” moving the All-Star Game out of Atlanta. He called Georgia’s law and similarly restrictive voting bills that Republicans are advancing in almost every state they control “Jim Crow on steroids.” In an interview this week with  , Mr. Manfred, the baseball commissioner, had hinted that he was strongly considering moving the game but declined to make any firm commitments. The Players Alliance, the group of Black professional baseball players, issued a statement in support of the league’s decision.  “We want to make our voice heard loud and clear in our opposition of the recent Georgia legislation that not only disproportionately disenfranchises the Black community, but also paves the way for other states to pass similarly harmful laws based largely on widespread falsehoods and disinformation,” the group  . “We will not be silenced,” the group said. “We won’t back down in the fight for racial equality. We will never stop breaking barriers to the ballot box.” Alan Blinder ,  Joe Drape  and  Tyler Kepner  contributed reporting."
A French Soccer Team Clings to First Place as the Bottom Falls Out,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/soccer/lille-psg-ligue-1.html,"On the surface, the pitch was a convincing one. Last year, the owners of Lille O.S.C. commissioned a graphic designer to produce a glossy prospectus, one intended to entice an investor into buying out their stake in the French soccer club. There are dozens of these documents swirling around soccer’s financial netherworld at any given time, passed around by the army of bankers, lawyers, private equity investors, deal-makers and middlemen who serve as gatekeepers to the handful of individuals both wealthy and foolhardy enough to buy and sell teams. Generally, pitches like the one about Lille are treated with both caution and cynicism, but this one probably would have been worth a second glance. The club’s infrastructure was sound: It had a large training facility at Luchin, and a capacious, modern stadium. Its location, too, was fertile ground for an ambitious, dynamic sort of a team: at the center of a transport nexus connecting London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, in the center of a part of northern France that contains the headquarters of dozens of corporations and a population of two million people, almost a third of them younger than 20. The centerpiece of the sales document, though, was Lille’s squad itself. The club’s real value, the prospectus claimed, lay in its talent. Every year, the club had invested substantial sums in crops of bright, young prospects, thanks in no small part to the work of Luis Campos, the Portuguese recruitment guru who oversaw the team’s transfer activity. Each influx of players was referred to as an “acquisition vintage”; as with wine, the idea was that the prospects would get better with age. The club estimated that its squad, at the time, had a cumulative transfer value of around $420 million. Its ceiling, though, was much higher: If all the players developed as they should, the club claimed, it was sitting on a pool of talent worth as much as $1 billion. In ordinary circumstances, this weekend would be the moment that Lille’s approach was vindicated. On Saturday, Lille travels to Paris St.-Germain for the most significant game of the Ligue 1 season: The teams are tied atop the standings, with the P.S.G. side built for hundreds of million of dollars, the one that can call on Neymar and Kylian Mbappé and the rest, ahead of Lille only on goal difference. But for Lille, the season when everything came together is also the season it all fell apart. Gérard López, Lille’s former owner, used to   that if his team was not “the best in the world in trading players, we’re probably in the top three, four or five.” This season should have been his proof. But if anything — and through no fault of their own — the market value of Lille’s players has not only fallen this season, but it has also dropped to such an extent that, in December, López had no choice but to cede control of the club. The end game arrived just before Christmas. López was summoned to London to meet with Lille’s two main creditors, JP Morgan Chase and Elliott Management, the activist investment firm founded and run by the hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer. In that meeting, the French sports newspaper L’Equipe reported, López tried everything he could to broker a deal to pay back the loans — worth around $140 million — that were set to come due this summer. He suggested a five-year financial restructuring, and proposed bringing on board  . He did not, it seems, want to give up Lille easily. Whenever he could, he found time to call Christophe Galtier, Lille’s coach, to update him on the progress of the talks. “He kept me informed of the situation last night,” Galtier said in December. “We talked a lot, when it was possible to talk.” Galtier was clearly touched: He   the next day to the man who had brought him on board in 2017. Elliott and JP Morgan, though, were unmoved. López’s reign was over. The director Marc Ingla soon followed him out the door. Eventually, so would Campos. In their stead, almost immediately, came a company called Callisto Sporting SARL, a subsidiary of an investment firm called Merlyn Partners. Both companies are registered in Luxembourg. Both are linked to Maarten Petermann, a former European head of special situations at JP Morgan. Olivier Létang, a veteran soccer executive, was named Lille’s president. The creditors’ decision, and the swiftness of their action, was rooted in the unavoidable fact that the financial reality of French soccer had shifted too much for López to be able to meet his commitments. Like every club in Ligue 1 — with the exception of Qatar-funded P.S.G. — Lille was facing a cash-flow crisis. The league’s decision   meant it had forfeited a tranche of broadcast revenue. Stadiums had been empty, at that stage, for almost nine months, and there was no sign that fans would be permitted to return any time soon. And, most pernicious of all, the  ; if a replacement could not be found, French domestic soccer was facing ruin. Lille’s circumstances, though, were particularly perilous. López’s tenure had always been something of a roller coaster; the club had been sanctioned on several occasions by the D.N.C.G., the body that oversees the economic health of France’s soccer teams, and at one point was threatened with relegation because of its precarious finances. Its release valve was always Campos’s seemingly never-ending pipeline of talent. In the summer of 2019, Lille had sold players — including the wing Nicolas Pépé, to Arsenal — for almost $180 million. A year later, even at the height of the pandemic, it had managed to turn a profit of $71 million in the transfer market. Despite those impressive returns, the club was barely keeping its head above water. Quite how it burned through so much money is not entirely clear, although the considerable running cost of its stadium is generally regarded as a significant factor. In 2018-19, the club posted an operating loss of $77 million. The year before, that deficit was $120 million. In a bull market, the club’s creditors had been prepared to tolerate those figures. That changed as 2020 became 2021, as revenues cratered, and as French soccer teetered on the brink. The club was heading for “bankruptcy in January,” according to Létang. This time, Lille could not sell its way out of trouble. The squad that has brought Lille into contention for its first French title since 2011 — and, more impressively, its first since the Qatari investment in P.S.G. fundamentally altered Ligue 1’s competitive balance — is testament not only to the deft and astute management of Galtier, but also to the keen eye of Campos. There is a reason that even José Mourinho, not a man given to complimenting other humans, is happy to talk about his friend’s “great career.” Campos, after all, is the technical director who pieced together the Monaco team that made   of the Champions League in 2017 and was then sold across the Continent for the better part of a billion euros. His work at Lille was, quietly, no less impressive, even if he was never, technically, an employee of the club. Instead, he was employed by a company called Scoutly, which was wholly owned by Victory Soccer, the vehicle through which López and Ingla owned Lille. López insisted that this Byzantine approach was necessary so that Campos could operate with “independence” in the market. Regardless, Lille benefited from the arrangement. Its squad is replete with the fruits of Campos’s labor: Boubakary Soumaré and Jonathan Ikoné, spotted in the reserve ranks at P.S.G.; Zeki Celik, plucked from the obscurity of the Turkish second division; Renato Sanches, offered a shot at rejuvenation after four years in the wilderness; and the two crown jewels, the most salable assets, the Dutch defender Sven Botman and the Canadian forward  . The belief that they might, together, one day be worth as much as that Monaco team of Mbappé and Bernardo Silva and Fabinho and the rest was, of course, overstated. That assumption rested on the idea that every single player would reach his maximum value, but it was, for a while, an explicable delusion. That changed as soon as the pandemic struck, and it calcified as the scale of French soccer’s financial crisis was laid bare. Ligue 1 expects to sign a new television deal in the coming weeks, almost certainly with Canal Plus, the broadcaster it ditched last summer. Broadcast money will bring some respite for the country’s clubs, but it will not fill the hole left by the empty promises of Mediapro. The teams of Ligue 1, then, are hurriedly trying to cut their budgets accordingly. Several already have agreed to pay cuts with their players. Lyon has offered a reduction in exchange for stock options. Most, though, will still need to sell players, trading on Ligue 1’s self-styled reputation as the “league of talents.” The problem is not only that prices will be depressed by the fact that so many teams in France need to raise funds, but also that few clubs in Europe retain their purchasing power. It was that, ultimately, that forced the hand of Lille’s creditors: Campos might still have provided players who can be sold, but in a market likely to be saturated by cut-price deals, Lille can no longer rely on premium fees. What happens next — what happens this summer — is not yet clear. Létang has said little beyond an insistence that the club cannot rely on qualification for next season’s Champions League for its financial health. Stability, he said, will be his watchword. The players have, as yet, not been alerted to a looming fire sale. A place in Europe would go some way, of course, to boosting the club’s finances. A French title, combined with a good showing in Europe next season, might help increase demand for some of the more recent acquisition vintages. Like wine, they will get better with age. The problem, now, is that what is inside the bottle matters rather less than the amount someone is prepared — or able — to pay for it."
,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-tournament-stanford.html,"SAN ANTONIO — Michelle Bain-Brink took books and a container of macaroons to her daughter, Cameron, a freshman forward for Stanford, the morning after the team rallied against Louisville on Tuesday to advance to the  . Bain-Brink fully expected to leave the packages with a security guard who would send them to her daughter’s room in the team hotel. Coincidentally, Cameron Brink was in the lobby at the same time, delivering a bag for the security guard to give to her mother. From 20 feet away, through the glass doors of the Marriott Rivercenter hotel in downtown San Antonio, the mother and daughter yelled “hello” and “love you” to one another. It was their first face-to-face conversation in person over the past three months. “I got quite emotional, because although I’ve seen her from the stands, seeing her like that, unexpectedly, was really touching,” Bain-Brink, who lives in Oregon, said in an interview on Wednesday. Bain-Brink and her husband, Greg Brink, are happy just to be here in San Antonio, able to attend their daughter’s games again even though they are not allowed direct contact. Stanford, seeking its first national title since 1992, defeated South Carolina, 66-65, in a semifinal on Friday to advance to Sunday’s championship game. Stanford was especially prepared for the bubblelike environment that players and staff members are enduring at the three-week-long national tournament centered in San Antonio. While the coronavirus pandemic led to restricted attendance at most college competitions, the Stanford team played the bulk of its season as a group of nomads, in strange arenas without fans or family in the stands. Until the Pac-12 tournament, which Stanford won last month, Cameron Brink’s parents had not watched in person as she competed for the Cardinal, and a year had passed since they last watched one of her games from the stands. The Cardinal had to spend nine consecutive weeks away from their Northern California campus, because the surrounding Santa Clara County had established coronavirus safety protocols that prohibited contact sports. Instead the team lived in hotels, periodically practiced in Las Vegas and played “home games” in Santa Cruz, about 45 miles from the Stanford campus. For parents who had been in the stands for almost every game since their child could hold a basketball, the experience was disorienting. “You forget what it is like to make eye contact with her as she’s coming off the court going into the locker room,” Bain-Brink said. When Kiana Williams, a senior on the Stanford team, told her father, Mike Williams, that spectators were going to be allowed at the Pac-12 tournament in Las Vegas, he “unglued” himself from his chair, he said, and called three relatives. He and his wife left the family home in San Antonio to see their daughter in person for the first time since he dropped her off at Stanford in September, with tears in his eyes. The conference tournament arrangement felt like winning the lottery, Mike Williams said in an interview on Wednesday. Then he learned about the N.C.A.A.’s   for this year’s national tournament. The whole event, rather than just the Final Four, would be held in San Antonio. “So now we’re on cloud nine, because now we didn’t have to travel and we knew she was going to be here for three weeks,” Williams said. “So we’re just full of joy, just happy. I told the parents in Vegas, since the tournament is going to be in San Antonio, let’s have a big powwow and I’ll barbecue for you.” He did — the Saturday before  . Such gatherings have enhanced a bond that the parents developed through video calls and WhatsApp messages this season while watching their children from afar. “It almost made us closer, when we couldn’t even be around each other, which seems backwards, but it’s something that’s very true,” Jaime Hull, the mother of the twins Lexie and Lacie Hull, said in an interview on Wednesday. “You start having that camaraderie together. Like on game days, parents text back and forth that we’re all sitting in our homes, watching the games and rooting everybody on.” When they are not watching games from the arena stands, the parents are having their own fun in San Antonio. The Brinks have been dipping into restaurants recommended by the television show “Diners, Drive-ins and Dives,” and the Hulls have been playing a number of card games. In a hotel about a block away, the Stanford players have found their own diversions — including a Ping-Pong tournament,  , just hours before the semifinal.  The parents have said that they can see a benefit of their children having been isolated together. On campus during the pandemic, players lived in apartments near the athletic facilities, limiting whom they would run into in hallways. Stanford was mostly barren, while the few students permitted to be there attended online classes from their residential bubbles. Leaving campus made the team tighter, Jaime Hull said. “I see a lot of individuals on teams, and I don’t see a lot of individuals on Stanford,” Jaime Hull said. “They play as a team, they play as a unit. One might be down and someone else might step up, and they are right there having each other’s back.” Same goes for the parents and the cheering squad. From that 300-person block of friends and family dressed in Cardinal attire — including Russell Wilson, a fairly accomplished football player who is better known in this crowd as the boisterous older brother of guard Anna Wilson — screams of “defense,” “Go Card” and “Ki” accompany the action. Kiana Williams’s cheering section is upward of 60 people: family, friends and basketball players on the youth team that her father coaches. The families take their job very seriously. When Stanford was   in the round of 8, the parents regrouped. “I felt like I played in the game at the end of that,” Jaime Hull said. “I was so sweaty, and I think my heel is bruised from pounding the bleacher with my foot.” Of course, playing near a teammate’s home has other perks. On Wednesday evening, Kiana Williams’s brother’s wife’s grandmother wrapped up two pans of homemade lasagna — one with meat and one without — and gave them to Williams’s mother, LaChelle, who drove them to the team’s hotel. She left the lasagna, cooked with love for the players and staff, with some of the credentialed personnel. “And it was delicious,” Coach Tara VanDerveer said. While the parents are excited to see their children to play, they are more thrilled about the prospect of having them come home. “As soon as the game is over and she gets on the bus and goes to the hotel, we’ll be right behind the bus,” Mike Williams said. “We have these big chair couches,” Greg Brink said of the family home in Oregon, “so a lot of people can climb on them at one time — a lot of cuddling, the dog is going to be jumping on top of this.” “Win or lose, I don’t care, I just can’t wait to be able to hold them. But they’re going to fight until the end,” Jaime Hull said, acknowledging that the title game on Sunday could delay the reunions. “So I’ll wait until Monday, if that’s what it takes, or Sunday night. I can make it that long.”"
Stanford Holds Off South Carolina to Reach Title Game,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/ncaabasketball/stanford-south-carolina-final-four.html,"SAN ANTONIO — Stanford is back in the N.C.A.A. women’s tournament title game for the first time since 2010 after sneaking past South Carolina on Friday night, 66-65, in a back-and-forth battle that came down to two missed shots by the Gamecocks on the final possession. Haley Jones grabbed an offensive rebound and put up a running shot with 32 seconds left to give Stanford a 1-point lead. Then, as the Cardinal tried to run out the clock, Aliyah Boston stole the ball with six seconds left, starting a fast break with a clear chance to win. But Brea Beal missed a layup from the left side while running at a full sprint, and Boston missed a short follow-up chance off the back of the rim. “It was in our hands, but we just came up short,” South Carolina guard Zia Cooke told reporters after the game. She led the Gamecocks with 25 points, including five 3-pointers that were clearly needed to counter Stanford’s aggressive 3-point attack. At times, especially in the third quarter, Cooke went back and forth with Jones, who scored 24 points for the Cardinal. The last time the Cardinal were in the national final, they fell to UConn, 53-47, in the Alamodome. Stanford, coached by Tara VanDerveer since 1985, last won the title in 1992. “To be able to bring us back to this national championship stage is just an honor,” Jones said. “For Tara, for the team, for the program.” Stanford struggled at the game’s start, committing four turnovers in the first five minutes, but took the lead on a set of free throws by junior guard Lexie Hull at the beginning of the second quarter. By halftime, the Cardinal were up by 6. As the game developed, both teams began favoring perimeter shots, with Jones and Cooke duking it out as a combination of players — including Cameron Brink and Fran Belibi — worked to keep Boston, South Carolina’s versatile star, from dominating. Boston finished with 11 points, on 5-of-14 shooting, and 16 rebounds. The teams continued to trade baskets in the middle of the fourth quarter. Stanford maintained a 4-point lead until South Carolina’s Destanni Henderson made a second-chance 3-pointer to bring the Gamecocks within a point. Stanford senior guard Kiana Williams immediately followed up with a jumper in the paint with just over 2 minutes to go. Williams had 8 points for the Cardinal; Henderson had 18 points, 5 rebounds and 3 assists for the Gamecocks. “We really just didn’t have an answer for Cooke or Henderson,” VanDerveer said. With 39 seconds left, South Carolina was down by 2. Henderson landed a step-back jumper for 3 points, giving the Gamecocks their first lead since the first quarter. But Jones quickly answered with the shot that ended up being the game-winner. “We’ll have to play better on Sunday in order to be successful,” VanDerveer said. Brink, who was managing an injured hamstring, spent much of the game keeping tabs on Boston and South Carolina forward Laeticia Amihere, using her 6-foot-4 frame to knock the ball away down low. Brink had six of Stanford’s 12 blocks; she also had 6 points and 4 rebounds. Stanford has hit 56 3-pointers over the course of the tournament, breaking the record of 54 set by UConn in 2015. The teams battled on a court that was new for the Final Four, replacing one of two courts that were used for earlier rounds in the large space that fits a football field in the Alamodome. The setup meant that the court was surrounded on three sides by fans — some cardboard cutout avatars, some human — while the fourth side had a large black curtain to separate the space from the quieter half of the stadium. Stanford got into gear against South Carolina much earlier than it did in its  . Cardinal sophomore forward Ashten Prechtel sparked her team in that game, a 78-63 victory, and ended up with 9 points and 8 rebounds in 24 minutes against South Carolina. Stanford will face Arizona, a fellow member of the Pac-12 and a No. 3 seed, for the national title on Sunday. They played twice during the regular season, the Cardinal winning both times. “It’s going to just come down to — Sunday — who’s getting after it, who’s most aggressive,” VanDerveer said. “We’ll have to be aggressive.”"
Arizona Shocks UConn and Storms to the N.C.A.A. Title Game,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/sports/ncaabasketball/arizona-uconn-ncaa.html,"From the very first possession on Friday night, Arizona’s national semifinal game against Connecticut was an exercise in slow, grind-it-out basketball, with a lot of missed shots and long, labored possessions. It was exactly what Arizona wanted. The Wildcats immediately established their strategy: suffocating defense with the steals to show for it, energetic rebounding and lots of 3-point shots. They pestered the No. 1 seed Huskies possession after possession, racking up a few more fouls than was optimal but ultimately throttling their heavily favored opponent from start to finish to secure a 69-59 victory and their first trip to the N.C.A.A. women’s basketball title game. “We shocked the world tonight,” said Aari McDonald, a senior whose game-high 26 points seemed to come at exactly the moments the third-seeded Wildcats needed them most. “Keep betting against me and my teammates, we’re going to prove you wrong.” Arizona, a No. 3 seed, will face top-seeded Stanford in the final on Sunday after derailing UConn, the most dominant program in the tournament’s history, and its heralded freshman, Paige Bueckers. Instead McDonald took over the stage, hitting two 3-point shots in the first quarter as the team went 6 of 13 on 3-pointers in the first half. “The first five minutes of the game are crucial,” McDonald said. “Coach Barnes hates it when I take 3s on the first possession, but I was feeling it.” Adia Barnes, the Arizona coach, had talked about the importance of not being intimidated by UConn’s history. “To win a championship, all you have to do is beat that team one time,” she had told reporters after her program advanced to its first spot in the Final Four. The Wildcats had a 32-22 lead at halftime, having held Connecticut to its lowest-scoring half of the season. The Huskies appeared to be within spitting distance for much of the second half without really sparking a significant comeback. Most of its efforts were led by junior Christyn Williams, who had 12 points in the first half and finished with 20 to lead the Huskies. But Arizona never really let up, and Williams fouled out with less than five minutes to play. “I think we came out with the wrong mentality,” Williams said. “We thought it was going to be easy, I guess, and we got flustered.” Anytime the Huskies looked as if they might have a chance to take control, McDonald would hit an impossible-to-ignore circus shot — like the one that she made with Evina Westbrook’s hand directly in front of her face in the second quarter. “I don’t think we’ve had to play against a guard as good as she is and she proved it tonight,” Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma said after the game. “We had no answer for her.” Whenever Connecticut was on offense, the Wildcats would chant “D up!” over and over. Guards Shaina Pellington and Bendu Yeaney neutralized Bueckers, allowing the guard, who typically scores 20 points per game, just one field goal in the first half. Bueckers, who has averaged 52.4 percent shooting, finished the night with 18 points and shot 38.4 percent, missing eight of her 13 shots. By the end of the first half, McDonald was running out the clock with the self-assurance of someone who had already won the game, waiting until the last seconds ticked off so she could try to hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer (she missed it). Connecticut outscored Arizona in the third quarter, but not enough to dig out of the 10-point hole in which they started it. The teams traded steals and turnovers, continuing their messy, physical game, with Arizona holding the Huskies at a distance while meticulously draining the shot clock on each possession. At one point, Wildcats guard Helena Pueyo scored with some tricky footwork to bring Connecticut’s deficit to 14 — the Huskies’ largest of the season. Auriemma immediately called a timeout, and Wildcat fans were euphoric. Arizona’s lead began to gradually shrink in the fourth quarter, as the Wildcats’ shots stopped falling with as much ease as they had earlier in the game. With seven minutes left in the game, though, McDonald hit a fadeaway jumper, giving Arizona a little breathing room once again. That cycle would repeat itself. With 4 minutes, 23 seconds left, the Wildcats were up 9 points — a lead that seemed fragile, as the team had hit just two of its 10 previous shots and more and more Arizona players got into foul trouble. Barnes took a timeout. The Wildcats immediately fouled Williams, and she hit both her free throws. But McDonald once again charged through traffic that would have seemed impenetrable for anyone else and wound up at the basket, fighting through contact for the bucket and a 3-point play — and also getting Williams out of the game with her fifth foul. (Video replays appeared to show that she did not touch McDonald on the play.) The clock kept ticking down, and with two minutes left Bueckers hit her fourth field goal to reduce the gap to 7 points. Then it dropped to 6, and with a minute left, just 5 points separated the Huskies from their fourth consecutive Final Four loss. Connecticut started fouling Arizona early, but the Wildcats hit five of their eight free throws in the final minute of the game, and that was enough to seal the win. “I’ve said all along this year, we have a very immature group,” Auriemma said. “We need to grow up if we expect to be back here in the future.” Barnes did not seem to entirely agree with that assessment. “Would I want to face UConn in a seven-game series?” she said. “Absolutely not.” Now her team will face a fellow member of the Pac-12, a Stanford team that defeated the Wildcats twice this season. But after taking down Connecticut, Arizona does not seem likely to be intimidated by any opponent. “We were the underdogs,” McDonald said. “It makes us play harder, everybody thinking we can’t beat these top teams. We’re made for it, like Coach says.”"
Houston Police Announce Investigation Into a Complaint About Deshaun Watson,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/deshaun-watson-lawsuits-police.html,"The Houston Police Department said on Friday that it had begun an investigation concerning Deshaun Watson, the star quarterback for the Houston Texans, after a complaint was filed against him. The department’s announcement on Twitter did not specify the nature of the report, and it was not clear whether the person who filed the complaint was one of the 21 women who have filed civil lawsuits in Harris County, Texas, accusing Watson of assault and sexual misconduct. Until Friday, there was no indication of a police report filed against Watson, though Tony Buzbee, the lawyer representing the women in the civil cases, had said that he and his clients planned to provide evidence to the authorities. “As with any allegation, the Houston Police Department is now conducting an investigation and will not comment further during the investigative process,” the department said on Twitter. All of the accusers, according to the lawsuits, have filed claims seeking monetary damages. The Police Department’s announcement was the latest development in a case that has unfolded over the past three weeks against one of the best and most recognizable players in the N.F.L., whose request to be traded from the Texans — made months before the first complaint was filed, on March 16 — has so far been rebuffed. Buzbee has announced accusations against Watson over social media and has used platforms such as Instagram to solicit potential clients. Buzbee and Rusty Hardin, the prominent Houston-based defense lawyer representing Watson, have sparred in statements, each trying to discredit the other’s tactics. Watson, 25, has not commented publicly since March 16, when he said on Twitter that he had “never treated any woman with anything other than the utmost respect” and that he had rejected “a baseless six-figure settlement demand” made by Buzbee before the first suit was filed. In a statement Friday night, Buzbee said that other criminal complaints would follow in Houston, as well as in other jurisdictions. He added that his legal team had filed a 22nd lawsuit Friday, with the plaintiff echoing the other women’s claims of lewd and coercive behavior by Watson. Hardin said in a statement that he welcomed the criminal investigation, which he called “long overdue.” “Now we will learn the identity of at least one accuser,” Hardin said. “We will fully cooperate with the Houston Police Department.” The 21 suits filed to date accuse Watson of engaging in a pattern of lewd behavior with women hired to provide personal services. In those suits, he is said to have coerced the women to touch him in a sexual manner, exposed himself to women he had hired for massages or moved his body in ways that forced them to touch his penis. The incidents cited in the suits were said to have taken place from March 2020 to March 2021, and in four states: Texas, Arizona, California and Georgia. In a statement on Friday, the N.F.L. said it was “continuing to monitor all developments in the matter which remains under review of the Personal Conduct Policy.” The policy allows the commissioner to suspend players or other league employees with pay while the league investigates allegations against them. The league relies on law enforcement and court records in addition to information gathered by its own investigators, including former prosecutors with experience handling cases involving sexual assault. The N.F.L. is in the midst of its off-season, so Watson and other players are not with their teams or visiting their sites for conditioning or practices. With the exception of certain bonuses, players are paid only during the season."
Baylor Overwhelms Houston to Reach N.C.A.A. Tournament Final,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/sports/ncaabasketball/baylor-houston-final-four.html,"INDIANAPOLIS — When Jared Butler left Alabama in the summer of 2018, enrolling at Baylor just before his freshman year started, he walked into what was a middling program, one that had not reached the N.C.A.A. tournament the prior season and had been known for its early flameouts. His eyes were on what was in front of him — competing for a starting job, getting adjusted to college and winning as many games as possible. A trip to the Final Four seemed as unlikely as a trip to the moon. “Could I believe it three years ago?” Butler said on Friday. “No.” Here the Bears are, though, having arrived not just at the Final Four for the first time since 1950, but on the cusp of winning their first national championship. They looked the part on Saturday night, overwhelming Houston, 78-59, in a national semifinal by rediscovering their deadeye 3-point shooting and unleashing a clampdown defense. The win moved Baylor into Monday night’s title game against undefeated Gonzaga,   that ended with Jalen Suggs hitting a 3-pointer as time expired in overtime. That set up a match four months in making, with a Baylor-Gonzaga game here in Indianapolis canceled in December just 90 minutes before tipoff because of a positive cases in the Baylor program. The atmosphere for that game, which would pit the teams who have been ranked atop The Associated Press Top 25 poll almost all season, almost certainly would not match the anticipation. Contemporary Final Fours have long grown beyond mere basketball games into mega events, played in cavernous football stadiums and accompanied by weekend-long entertainment. The tipoffs, accompanied by a sea of flashbulbs, carry a palpable energy. This one is noticeably muted because of the pandemic, from the absence of throngs of fans carousing through downtown Indianapolis on Friday night, to the large curtain that divided Lucas Oil Stadium in half — limiting the crowd to less than 10,000. (The semifinals drew a record 72,238 here in 2015.) Also absent, as they have been throughout the tournament, are the team’s cheerleaders and bands — such a staple of the men’s tournament that the N.C.A.A., through its television contract, is required to transport them to the Final Four. “It still feels like we’re playing basketball,” Butler said. “We go back to the hotel. It’s just us, us the team. And we just got one mission, one goal. I think it will sink in later on in life or maybe two months from now when I’m, like, wow, we’re really in the national championship game.” In trying to create a more customary aesthetic for television, the organizers filled many of the empty seats with cardboard cutouts — often including schools’ famous basketball players. Occupying several seats were Michigan’s Cazzie Russell, the Fab Five and a more recent star, Trey Burke.  , occupied another. As did a startlingly clean-shaven Justin Turner — in his Cal State Fullerton baseball uniform. Turner’s presence was a reminder that, while the men’s and women’s tournaments have largely proceeded uninterrupted — the Virginia Commonwealth men were the only team to leave the tournament because of virus cases — playing in a pandemic can be a capricious exercise. Turner, the third baseman for the Los Angeles Dodgers,   because of a positive test. There was no such intervention on behalf of Houston on Saturday. The Cougars, playing in their first Final Four since 1984, had their mettle tested on path to a national semifinal — rallying from 10 points down to beat Rutgers and mustering enough to finish off Oregon State after blowing a 17-point lead — but they only had to beat double-digit seeds to get there. Houston carried with it an intransigent defense team whose senior guard, spindly DeJon Jarreau, locked down two of the tournament’s hottest scorers, Syracuse’s Buddy Boeheim and Oregon State’s Ethan Thompson. But it is hardly an exaggeration to suggest that the Cougars’ best scoring option is an offensive rebound. They led the nation in offensive rebounding percentage, according to KenPom.com, grabbing 39.8 percent of their missed shots. The Cougars’ first possession had to give Baylor Coach Scott Drew pause when Reggie Chaney and Justin Gorham grabbed offensive rebounds for Houston before Marcus Sasser sank a wide-open 3-pointer. It turned out to be the last hurrah for Houston. Baylor locked down everybody but Sasser, securing the defensive boards and assailing the Cougars defense with a hail of 3-pointers. When Davion Mitchell swished a 3-pointer at the halftime buzzer, it put them up 45-20 — all but giving them a pass-through to Monday night. The Baylor defense shackled the entire Houston offense with the exception of Sasser, who scored 17 of his team’s 20 points in the first half. Everyone else was a combined 1 for 15 at halftime. The Bears, who were the best 3-point shooting team in the country during the regular season, regained their form — especially Butler, who made 4 of 5 behind the arc and scored 17 points, all in the first half. His backcourt mates, Mitchell and MaCio Teague, contributed mightily with 12 points and 11 assists for Mitchell and 11 points and 6 assists for Teague. And while Houston did manage 14 offensive rebounds, those were offset by 13 by Baylor and the Cougars’ 38.2 percent shooting. If Baylor can replicate Saturday’s performance, it would cap a lengthy climb from an ignominious depth. Drew was hired in 2003 after   — one Baylor player murdered another and the coach at the time, Dave Bliss, instructed players to lie to investigators, who uncovered a variety of rule breaking in the program. The Bears were hit with severe penalties, including a ban on nonconference games in 2006, and won 21 games total in Drew’s first three seasons. They reached respectability eventually. And they took advantage of broken brackets to reach regional finals in 2010 and 2012. Those accomplishments came amid an N.C.A.A. investigation that found that Baylor coaches had made 1,200 impermissible phone calls or texts to recruits and Drew was cited for failing to monitor his program. Now, though, the Bears are one game away from a title that few, including their star guard, might have seen coming."
"In Moving All-Star Game, Another Sport Flexes Its Activist Muscles",sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/sports/baseball/all-star-georgia-voting-law.html,"For major American sports leagues that long have taken pains to stay out of divisive issues around race and social activism, the past few years have seen a remarkable awakening. Top leagues and their multimillionaire stars have come out forcefully and publicly against police brutality and  , and just as strongly in support of L.G.B.T.Q. causes and the right of their players to kneel during the national anthem. Players have spoken at protest marches, and leagues have bankrolled new social-justice efforts. In Georgia, a professional women’s basketball team actively campaigned against its owner, a sitting Republican Senator, before last year’s November elections, and in doing so helped   to Democrats. Still, it was striking when, after days of mounting pressure, the Major League Baseball Commissioner, Rob Manfred, announced on Friday that the league would pull the 2021 All-Star Game out of suburban Atlanta in   that critics have predicted would  . Relocating the game — an expensive logistical hassle, and a move that even baseball’s players did not universally support — was a watershed moment for a sport long known more for its traditionalism and its aversion to risk. Baseball, which until 1947 barred Black players from its teams, was drawn into American sports activism through pioneering figures like   and  . But more recently, it was also a sport that   to move the 2011 All-Star Game out of Arizona over a contentious immigration law, and stood aside as one of its franchises defended an   and another allowed its fans to continue using  . Baseball was the last of the major American sports leagues to acknowledge the killing of George Floyd last year — waiting a full nine days. But it embraced the Black Lives Matter movement when it returned to the field last summer, and by the fall it had volunteered its shuttered stadiums as early voting sites. The All-Star Game and its week of festivities were set to include celebrations of the legacy of  , a civil rights icon who died earlier this year. But by Friday, Manfred said, he had concluded that moving the game and baseball’s annual draft out of Georgia were “the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport.” Over the past five years, sports has embraced an activism that has quietly revealed a power shift from the rich, mostly white men who run them to the not-quite-as-rich, mostly nonwhite athletes who compete in them. Activism’s arrival in sports is not new, of course. From baseball’s Robinson to boxing’s Muhammad Ali to football’s Colin Kaepernick to soccer’s Megan Rapinoe, athletes have long pressed social-justice causes important to them and their communities. But the breadth and the public nature of the efforts over the past year, as social justice protests swept the nation on the eve of a presidential election, have shown the willingness of leagues, teams and athletes to engage in debates and take positions they had often avoided. Sometimes the shift was done reluctantly, the result of national politics or changing public opinion. Sometimes teams and leagues were prodded to act by their own players. But Friday showed once again that sports isn’t simply entertainment in a vacuum. “Throughout the year, there’s been a lot of things going on not only with the pandemic but as a society,” Alex Cora, the Boston Red Sox Manager, told reporters on Friday. “They moved it for the right reasons.” It was only five years ago that Kaepernick’s decision to quietly kneel during the national anthem to protest systemic racism and police brutality sparked stiff disapproval from some team owners and criticism from a strident part of the white fan base. But eventually, even N.F.L. owners like the Dallas Cowboys’ Jerry Jones, who once   during the national anthem, were   on the sidelines. And players, aware that their wealth and their stature gave them a valuable megaphone aided by social media, kept pressing. After Jacob Blake, a Black man, was left paralyzed by the police in Kenosha, Wis., the Milwaukee Bucks refused to take part in a playoff game in August in Orlando, Fla. Within hours, dozens of other teams in other leagues  . Within days,   emerged from a meeting with N.B.A. officials with new commitments that it would join their fight against social injustice. Some players went beyond causes to overtly political acts like campaigning for specific candidates. In the W.N.B.A., players on the Atlanta Dream became so   by the statements by the team’s co-owner, the Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler, about the Black Lives Matter movement that they actively campaigned for her opponent, Dr. Raphael G. Warnock,   onto the court. Loeffler lost the election, sweeping not just her opponent but also another Democrat running in the state to victory. The two victories gave Democrats, under President Biden, control of the nation’s legislative agenda, and the momentum to push for some of the progressive causes the players held dear. There were many factors, though, that made M.L.B.’s action on Friday unique. While major league club owners are no different than their counterparts in professional basketball or football in being a largely Republican donor set, the demographics on the field are starkly different. The sport’s fan base is older and less racially diverse than basketball’s and football’s. The majority of major league players are white, and many trend conservative in their personal politics. (Roughly 30 percent of M.L.B. players are Latino, most of them from outside the United States; only 8 percent are Black.) Frustrated by the sense that they are invisible in their sport, some Black players grumbled when M.L.B. took more than a week to address the killing of Mr. Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer last May, and as the ensuing protests over his death — and other Black Americans — quickly spread across the nation. By opening day last July, though, baseball’s leaders had   to organize on-field demonstrations. The league provided Black Lives Matter shirts for players to wear, and teams were allowed to paint a BLM logo on the back of the pitcher’s mound —   for television viewers. And in September, Major League Baseball — and the players’ union —   to the Players Alliance, a nonprofit made up of more than 100 current and former Black players. The group was among those Manfred spoke with this week before announcing his decision to move the All-Star Game. “We will not be silenced,” the Players Alliance   on Friday, decrying the Georgia law and how it paved the way for similar legislation elsewhere. “We won’t back down in the fight for racial equality. We will never stop breaking barriers to the ballot box.” For baseball, the groundswell against its hosting the All-Star Game in July at the Atlanta Braves’ stadium, Truist Park, grew as Manfred worked the phones this week. As political activists and important corporate partners of the Braves like Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola spoke out against the voting law, Manfred held conversations with team owners and the players’ union and current and former players, but he didn’t require a formal vote of approval for his decision. In fact, the union hadn’t yet finished canvassing players when Manfred made his announcement. Some players, such as the Braves star Freddie Freeman,   for the game to stay in Atlanta, so it could serve as a platform for a discussion about voting rights.  In a rare public rebuke of M.L.B. by a team, the Braves said they were “deeply disappointed” by Manfred’s announcement that he would move the game, and called businesses, employees and fans in Georgia “victims” of his decision. Other teams, though, stood just as strongly behind Manfred. The Miami Marlins part owner Derek Jeter, a Hall of Fame former player and the only nonwhite chief executive in baseball, released   that supported Manfred’s decision and noted that his team in November had engaged in an activity — providing meals to voters at a polling place — that is now illegal in Georgia. And the Baltimore Orioles chief executive, John Angelos, released a statement with Mayor Brandon Scott of Baltimore, who had lobbied earlier in the day to host the All-Star Game. “As the birthplace of civil rights icon Thurgood Marshall, we stand united with Commissioner Manfred in denouncing this malicious legislative effort to suppress voters in Georgia and other state legislatures,” they said. Although no active player had publicly called for a boycott of the All-Star Game, Manfred understood what could happen if Atlanta remained the host city, a baseball official said. The tributes to Aaron would have celebrated perhaps the greatest Black player in history. But if the event remained in Atlanta, players and coaches might be faced with questions about whether they would take part or stay away to protest the voting law. Dave Roberts, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ manager, who is Black and Asian-American, had said last week that he would consider declining the honor of managing the National League team. But on Friday, he sounded relieved. “For the commissioner, to kind of do his due diligence in baseball, outside of baseball, players, front office, and ultimately make a decision to remove the All-Star Game and the draft out of the state of Georgia, I support,” he told reporters. A star in another sport was equally thrilled. “Proud to call myself a part of the @mlb family today,” LeBron James of the N.B.A.’s Los Angeles Lakers wrote on Twitter, quietly reminding fans that he had   this week. The voting organization that James launched last year,  , went further: It noted that it had called on Georgia lawmakers to drop the voting bill during the recent N.B.A. All-Star Weekend in Atlanta, and it cautioned other states contemplating similar measures. “All the states still considering voter suppression bills should take note,” the organization   citing the M.L.B. All-Star relocation. “Actions have consequences.” Alan Blinder contributed reporting."
"The Confidence, Speed and Shooting of Aari McDonald",sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/sports/ncaabasketball/arizona-aari-mcdonald.html,"Aari McDonald has always had an eye for the ball. Her mother, Andrea McDonald, who played basketball in high school, first noticed it during family pickup games in Aari’s grandparents’ driveway. When Aari, the youngest of six children, was a few months old, Andrea would set her up in a baby bouncer while she played. “Wherever that orange ball was, that’s where she was looking,” Andrea said, laughing. “If you didn’t have the ball, you were of no importance to her.” Connecticut felt the brunt of that focus when  , to the Wildcats’ first Final Four. McDonald’s 26-point performance — her 92nd consecutive game with double-digit scoring, the longest active streak in women’s college basketball — showcased the quickness and the relentless energy that, along with her earned confidence that she can put the ball into the basket pretty much at will, have become impossible to ignore. “I’m just happy that the world is finally noticing what I can do,” McDonald said in an interview. “I’m a two-way player, and it’s not a one-man show.” The 5-foot-6 guard grew up in Fresno, Calif., where from a young age she followed in her parents’ and siblings’ footsteps by getting into sports. She is named Aarion, after her father, Aaron McDonald, who played football in college. Her brother Tre’Von Willis played basketball at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Her mother, to Aari’s chagrin, boasts about her own high school basketball highlights with some of the same unflappable confidence as her daughter. “She used to say her jumper was butter, and that she’d mastered shooting off the backboard,” McDonald said, with a nearly audible eye roll. “I’m like, ‘Mom, come on now.’” Her mother was her first coach, bringing the then-7-year-old Aari onboard with her Amateur Athletic Union team for children 10 and under. She was the youngest player on the court, but the energetic play that has become her trademark was already obvious, if slightly misdirected. “I was just literally everywhere,” McDonald said. “I used to freaking foul all the time. I would foul out, and my mom would be like, ‘Aarion, what are you doing?’” Her mother remembers things differently. Aari’s older teammates were reluctant on the court, she said, requiring coaxing to move around and shoot, while Aari was already making improbable shots. “She kept us in those games,” Andrea said. “I had to take a double look, like, ‘Is she really making these baskets?’” “She was like a little gnat,” her father recalled of those early games. “You just couldn’t get her off of you.” By sixth grade, McDonald was playing on a boys’ A.A.U. team. She also played volleyball and ran track, but basketball quickly became her top priority. She started getting attention in the local news media when she became her high school’s leading scorer by a large margin as a freshman, and garnered even more when she started getting triple-doubles and even, once, a quadruple-double. As her abilities grew, she didn’t. McDonald insists that her height never threatened her basketball ambitions and credits her mother for her confidence in spite of being perpetually underestimated. “Every game, throughout my whole career, my mom has always told me to be a feisty competitor and leave everything out on the floor,” McDonald said. “Me being small, I had to do things that other players didn’t want to do, whether that was diving on the floor for loose balls or taking charges.” Plus, she believes she has other gifts that have fueled her career. “You can’t teach speed,” McDonald said. “You can’t teach heart.” Because she wanted to stay on the West Coast, McDonald began her college career at the University of Washington, where Adia Barnes, who is now Arizona’s coach, was an assistant. But McDonald wasn’t content, far from her family and her ailing grandfather — and playing behind the N.C.A.A.’s career leading scorer, Kelsey Plum. When Barnes, who had recruited McDonald, took the Arizona job, the decision to follow her was a fairly easy one. “This is what we talked about,” McDonald said of the conversations that had led to her transfer. “It’s all coming full circle.” The transfer, however, meant that McDonald had to sit out a year. A year of playing on the scout team, able to show all of her teammates — but not outsiders who had overlooked her — what she could do. Arizona forward Sam Thomas was a freshman during McDonald’s first season at Arizona, and when she first met McDonald, she was struck by how quiet she was. “She didn’t say anything at all,” Thomas said. On the court, it was a different story. Barnes would tell her team to defend McDonald in practice. It proved nearly impossible. “We’re trying to work on our defense, and Aari’s just scoring and scoring,” Thomas said. “We were like, ‘How are we supposed to work on our defense when we can’t stop her?’” That season, Arizona went 6-24. The following season, McDonald’s first competing for the Wildcats, they won 24 games and the Women’s National Invitation Tournament championship. She scored 890 points that season, breaking the program’s single-season scoring record set by her coach, Barnes. That energy, which McDonald says is the product of the conditioning that she prioritizes above almost everything else, became infectious. “She’s always on 10,” Thomas said. “She never, ever, ever gets tired in a game — which is crazy, because I get tired just looking at her.” In McDonald’s three years playing for Arizona, she has set numerous records and received as many accolades, most recently being named the Pac-12 player of the year and sharing the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year Award. That the Wildcats have managed so many tough wins in the tournament is, her teammates say, a testament to McDonald’s impact. “She’s always been able to score 30 points a game, but I just think now she’s just been growing so much as a leader,” Thomas said. “She’s getting more confident. She’s bringing the team with her.” In a few weeks, she will most likely have a new team, as her W.N.B.A. draft stock keeps rising with each surprise victory. Before she goes pro, though, McDonald will face one more huge test in the Wildcats’ title game against top-seeded Stanford. She’ll get ready the same way as usual: by listening to some Dom Kennedy and Meek Mill and eating a lot of bananas. The rest is just what McDonald referred to over and over again as a “strong mind-set,” asserting herself every second of the game. “My goal is to make it harder for you,” McDonald said. “I want to create havoc.” If the shots fall, that helps. But either way, McDonald doesn’t plan on letting Stanford out of her sight."
What to Watch For in the Women’s N.C.A.A. Basketball Final,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-womens-tournament-final-stanford-arizona.html,"SAN ANTONIO — For the first time, two teams from the Pac-12 will fight for the national title in the N.C.A.A. women’s tournament final as top-seeded Stanford faces Arizona, a No. 3 seed. Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer likes the idea of the all-Pac-12 matchup. “That would be awesome,” she said after Stanford squeezed past South Carolina in a tight semifinal battle for its spot in the title game. “We’re rooting for Arizona. It would be really exciting, it’s just I think a credit to how competitive the Pac-12 is.” She is no longer rooting for Arizona, which stunned top-seeded UConn, 69-59, in the national semifinals on Friday night. Only six prior N.C.A.A. women’s title games have featured teams within the same conference: Three were between Southeastern Conference teams, two were within the Big East and one was in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Stanford made it into the final by the skin of its teeth, defeating South Carolina, 66-65, then watched Arizona reach its first national-title game in program history. “I’ve been saying all along: Pac-12 is the best conference in the country, hands down,” Arizona Coach Adia Barnes said after the Wildcats routed the Huskies. “I think this is proof of it. Stanford won the Pac-12, we were second, and we’re playing for a national championship.” In the championship game, Stanford will seek its third title while Arizona will pursue its first. The final starts at 6 p.m. Eastern time, and will be televised on ESPN. Here are a few things to follow: Both of these teams employ a lot of ball pressure and have the length to cover the floor. Stanford and Arizona are the best in the Pac-12  . Arizona held UConn, with its typically high-octane offense, to its lowest-scoring game of the season in the national semifinals. Stanford has been protecting the rim with a combination of Cameron Brink, Fran Belibi and Anna Wilson. “Usually defensively one of our strengths is our guard defense,” VanDerveer said. “Anna Wilson has been a lockdown defender for us all year.” And neither team is afraid to foul or be fouled. “Trapping Aari is very difficult,” Barnes said of Arizona’s leading contributor on Friday, Aari McDonald. “I think she did a good job of drawing fouls. Aari got fouled nine times in the game.” The Pac-12 player of the year has owned the Alamodome’s floors, scoring at least 26 points in each of the past three games. She is lithe yet powerful, cutting through defenses and outrunning those who try to contain her. While she is often most effective when penetrating defenses, she is also dangerous from the outside: McDonald has been shooting almost 42 percent from beyond the arc in the postseason. And she is a formidable defender, often stealing the ball and converting turnovers into points. She has also had more than five defensive rebounds in each of the past four games. “She’s really underrated on defense,” Barnes said after the national semifinal. “I thought in my mind she should have been the national defensive Player of the Year. There was no other player that impacts the game on both ends of the floor more.” With solid defenders congesting the paint, it is a good thing neither team fears shooting from outside. Though it has taken Arizona a bit longer to get comfortable shooting from deep, the Wildcats have landed 42 3-pointers in this tournament, shooting 34 percent. Stanford set a record in its win over South Carolina for made 3-pointers in the tournament with 56. UConn set the previous record of 54 in 2015. The Cardinal were 5 of 8 on 3-pointers on Friday night. And Stanford has plenty of players who can shoot: Kiana Williams is one of the Cardinal’s most reliable shooters, landing a 3-pointer in every game she had played since early January until Friday night. Despite that lapse, leading scorers Haley Jones and Lexie Hull were perfect on 3-point shots. “My teammates see me shoot at practice, I feel confident,” Jones said in a postgame interview on Friday. “They just kind of instill their confidence in me when I don’t have it in myself.” Though Stanford has prevailed in two previous matchups with Arizona this season, Barnes is unafraid after coming this far. “They’ve beat us twice this year: They have to beat us a third time,” she said."
Women’s Basketball Is a Renewed Flashpoint for an Embattled N.C.A.A.,sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/sports/ncaabasketball/womens-basketball-ncaa-tournament.html,"The women’s basketball players of Immaculata often washed their own uniforms. They flew standby to save money, and sold pencils and toothbrushes to finance travel costs to their first national tournament. A collection of pail-pounding nuns made up a raucous cheering section. But the tiny Catholic school outside Philadelphia dominated women’s college basketball in the early 1970s. “It was crazy: nuns in full habit banging on metal buckets and yelling for this team,” recalled Cathy Rush, who coached Immaculata to three consecutive national championships beginning in 1972. “We thought we were blessed.” The advent of Title IX, the federal law that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex in nearly every educational setting, made the era an expectant, revolutionary one for women’s athletics. Approaching a half-century later, though, women’s basketball is still struggling for full acceptance in the male-dominated world of college sports and in American society as a whole. This year’s N.C.A.A. women’s basketball tournament, which will conclude Sunday in San Antonio, has been a weekslong display of athletic intrigue and talent — and a showcase of the indignities, like   publicized online by the Oregon forward Sedona Prince, that players and coaches say prove that their sport is still seen and treated as second-class. “It was so blatant, and it pulled back the curtain and it allowed people to say, ‘This is a systemic problem,” said Cori Close, the coach at U.C.L.A. “People who were intimately involved in college athletics were not shocked, but they were deeply disappointed,” said Heather Lyke, the athletic director at Pittsburgh and a member of one of the N.C.A.A.’s most influential management groups. “They’re thankful that the discrepancies were captured and displayed and that people reacted the way they did, which was appalled or outraged or frustrated. People didn’t dismiss it.” That is partly because women’s basketball is a powerful force in American athletics, especially compared with what it once was. These days, the sport’s luminaries can be household names, its games collectively draw millions of fans in person and on television, and the inequities that emerged from San Antonio drew swift attention online and in Congress. But a sport that has spent years contemplating ways to break through — and how much it should stand as a brand of its own — is finding it difficult to outrun a history of sexism, infighting and media rights deals that overwhelmingly tilt eyeballs and money toward men’s basketball. The debacle in San Antonio cast a harsh light toward the N.C.A.A., which was already under   because of   and a crush of public and   to change longstanding rules that would allow players to profit off their fame and benefit in some way from the ballooning financial might of college sports. Now the association is facing doubts over the depth of its commitment to one of its marquee offerings. “Everybody is looking at treatment issues and promotion issues, when the last 40 to 50 years has been focused on participation issues,” said Donna A. Lopiano, the director of women’s athletics at the University of Texas for nearly two decades and now the president of the Drake Group, a nonprofit organization that seeks changes in college sports. “Now the whole laundry list is open, and that’s significant.” The N.C.A.A. has repeatedly apologized for the problems in San Antonio and   to lead a review of how it conducts it championship events, with a particular eye toward gender equity and a report expected this summer. But the strategy was privately greeted with shrugs inside the college sports industry. What, people around women’s basketball asked, could a lawyer conclude that they had not been saying for decades?  If Mark Emmert, the N.C.A.A. president, wants to understand how to resolve the disparities, “he should look in the mirror,” said Muffet McGraw, who coached Notre Dame to two national titles before she retired last year. “I think they’re oblivious,” McGraw said. “I don’t think they care, either. I think they’re so worried about protecting the men’s tournament, they don’t really bother with anyone else.” The N.C.A.A. held its inaugural men’s basketball championship in 1939. It was not until 1971 that the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women opened for business as an alternative to an N.C.A.A. that was already regarded as both dismissive of women’s sports and more embracing of commercialism than academics. Title IX became law in 1972. By 1973, the A.I.A.W. faced a potent legal challenge to its ban on athletic scholarships, which had been intended to help women’s sports grow without teams facing commercial pressures. Coaches and players from two Florida schools sued and argued that if men deserved scholarships, so did women. The A.I.A.W. relented — a concession that led to a policy change to allow teams to compete even if they chose to offer scholarships. It also set into motion a decline of the organization’s influence over women’s sports and an upending of the athletic order. Small-school dynasties like Immaculata, where administrators balked at funding scholarships, could no longer compete at the top level. Rush remembers a stark realization: “If I wanted to continue coaching basketball, it had to be someplace else.” Athletic centers for women were the stuff of miserly legend, with a converted men’s locker room, freshly outfitted with  , offered to women’s basketball players at Texas A&M. Schools were simultaneously searching for ways to outmaneuver Title IX, with which colleges were supposed fully compliant by 1978. Christine Grant, the former women’s athletic director at Iowa, recalled the “submerging” strategy: Schools with separate athletic departments would combine them and place the director of men’s athletics in charge. “It was a very successful strategy that was used in order to keep the status quo,” Grant said. Still, the N.C.A.A. saw women’s sports as an industry poised to boom and “had two things the A.I.A.W. could not hope to match: money and status,” Pamela Grundy and Susan Shackelford wrote in the book   a history of women’s basketball. The N.C.A.A. had a $20 million budget and promised to devote $3 million to women’s championships, a vow that swamped the A.I.A.W.’s budget of $1 million. Women’s athletics executives waged a fierce debate over what to do, and whether to cede influence to men, who were suspected by some to be hungry for control, not equity. But when the N.C.A.A. staged its first women’s tournament in 1982, it attracted top teams. “We were given a whole lot,” said Sonja Hogg, who coached Louisiana Tech to an A.I.A.W. title in 1981 and to an N.C.A.A. championship in 1982. “Not to disparage the A.I.A.W., but they just didn’t have the money. Our athletes were at a disadvantage.” Few events shaped women’s basketball like the A.I.A.W.’s demise. The embrace of the N.C.A.A. and the parallel pivot toward such a monetized model, current and former executives and coaches said, fed structural inequities that endure to this day. When Title IX was enacted,   were women, but that  . The inequities are also found inside the N.C.A.A.’s organizational chart and  , which have left the women’s game understaffed and less funded compared with men’s basketball. “It’s not comforting to know that for the last 30-something years, there’s still disparity, even at the University of Connecticut, and we’re about as close as you can get to equity as any place in the world,” Geno Auriemma, the school’s coach, told Emmert during   on Wednesday. Connecticut’s raft of titles and 13th consecutive appearance in the Final Four on Friday, when it lost to Arizona, have drawn much admiration but also have fueled perceptions that women’s basketball was less competitive and entertaining. And some critics have argued the sport is less worthy than the men’s game because it does not generate nearly as much money. Women’s basketball, though, is developing   did generations ago. In the first 37 years of the men’s tournament, U.C.L.A. and Coach John Wooden won 10 national titles. In the first 37 years of the women’s tournament, Auriemma’s Huskies captured 11. This year’s women’s Final Four included a familiar trio of powers: Connecticut, South Carolina and Stanford. But there was also a newcomer — Arizona — and a mounting case that the women’s game has more competition and depth than the men’s game did at the same stage of its development. A No. 16 seed defeated a No. 1 seed in the women’s tournament in 1998, two decades before the same feat happened in the men’s tournament. And those celebrated U.C.L.A. teams stocked with the likes of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, then known as Lew Alcindor, and Bill Walton are enshrined as some of the greatest ever — but also came at a time when conferences could send just one team to the men’s tournament, cutting down on challenges to U.C.L.A.’s supremacy. With greater parity emerging, and with women’s sports now an integral part of the American sports landscape, women’s college basketball officials see potential for enormous growth. They have been making a similar case for years. “I don’t think anyone says, ‘Well, professional basketball, they’re bigger and stronger so I just want to watch professional basketball — not college basketball,’” said Tara VanDerveer of Stanford, who this season became  . Basketball fans, she said, “appreciate women’s basketball for what it is and appreciate men’s basketball for what it is.” “I think there’s enough room, whether it’s on television, whether it’s arenas, for both — and for both to be great,” said VanDerveer, whose team will play for the national championship after edging South Carolina. “And we do have a bigger area to grow because we started so far behind.” In 2013, Val Ackerman, who had led the W.N.B.A., prepared   about the women’s college game and its future. In interviews, she heard wide-ranging recommendations and feedback: “Get scoring up.” The sport is “still an afterthought to most people in positions of authority.” “No one would stay committed to the sport without Title IX.” But, Ackerman concluded, no women’s college sport was “better positioned in the near term to generate revenues or, potentially, profits.” Ackerman, now the commissioner of the Big East Conference, detailed an array of proposals, including blending the men’s and women’s tournaments into a single event, much the way tennis does with its Grand Slams, or having the women’s Final Four at a quasi-permanent location. She floated the suggestion of a 24-second shot clock — it remains at 30 seconds — and the idea of capitalizing on basketball’s international popularity by staging a women’s Final Four in China or Qatar. Some ideas were adopted, like playing 10-minute quarters instead of 20-minute halves. But to read the report now is to see a range of unheeded recommendations, fueling public and private questioning of the N.C.A.A.’s support for a sport that it contends is a priority. Naz Hillmon, a junior forward at Michigan, noted this past week how, even before she was in college, the official March Madness app did not feature women’s basketball. “Is it great for us to have this separately or should we always be the exact same as what the men have going on?” she said, adding: “That’s a question that will have to roll through a lot of people’s minds for a little bit to get a definitive answer, because if we want to say that men and women’s basketball is completely equal, then things like that probably should be the same.” Others eagerly ticked through their lengthening lists of long-term shortcomings. The failure to use the March Madness branding for the women’s tournament. The decision to set up a basketball academy for high school boys but no similar program for girls. The lack of financial incentives, which are offered in the men’s competition, for conferences when teams advance in the women’s tournament. The organizational chart that has the N.C.A.A.’s vice president of women’s basketball reporting to an executive whose primary focus is the men’s tournament. “We want to be partners with the N.C.A.A., we want to make a difference with the N.C.A.A., we want to be transformative in the lives of women — and men,” said Close, the U.C.L.A. coach and the incoming president of the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association. “We all understand how imperative the men’s basketball tournament is to the structure of the N.C.A.A. — nobody begrudges that, we’re grateful for that,” she added. “There’s a lot of benefit that has happened through the years because of what an incredible event that is. We’re not complaining about that. It’s not that we want anything less for the men. We just want to help our women have more dignity, more investment and more opportunity to master their craft at the same level.” There have been some successes. Participation in Division I women’s basketball is up slightly from about a decade ago, as is attendance. This year, for the first time since 1995, some women’s tournament games have aired on a national broadcast network, and all 63 matchups have appeared on national television, with some earning higher ratings than professional sporting events. But the women’s tournament, part of a 14-year multisport deal that the N.C.A.A. signed with ESPN in 2011, is being credited with only $6.7 million or so in media money, much less than many analysts believe it is worth. The N.C.A.A. is earning more than $850 million for the television rights for this year’s men’s tournament. In 2019, when the N.C.A.A. most recently held full championship events, the women’s tournament attracted about 275,000 in-person fans, or roughly 40 percent of what the men’s tournament drew. That year, the N.C.A.A. budgeted $13.5 million less for the women’s tournament than the men’s, a gap that officials attributed to differences in competition formats and the bigger crowds that the men’s game drew. This year’s troubles in San Antonio, though, brought the sport’s struggles into the spotlight, largely because increasingly empowered student-athletes turned to social media. The N.C.A.A. has blamed logistical challenges related to the pandemic for the breakdown in standards, an explanation that coaches and players said they understood but still left them hurt. VanDerveer described the entire episode as “beyond a turnover.” “Your team might go out and make mistakes, but this is not being prepared for the game,” the Stanford coach said. “There’s got to be better communication and decision making.” Beyond citing the pandemic, N.C.A.A. officials have said little about how so many disparities could have happened at the women’s tournament, which had a dedicated planning staff of six people compared with the 12 who were focused on the men’s competition. On Thursday, Emmert said the N.C.A.A.’s critics were right to judge the organization by its marquee events. “They have to be the benchmarks that we judge gender equity by,” he said of the basketball championships. “If we’re failing at that level, we’re failing across the board.” Lynn Holzman, who played at Kansas State and rose to become the N.C.A.A’s vice president of women’s basketball, told coaches on Wednesday that she expected “pretty substantive changes,” but she did not elaborate. And so the women’s basketball community waits. They are accustomed to it, they say, frustratingly accustomed. Over the past two weeks or so, some mulled over what the game could have been if the A.I.A.W. had survived. “Is it time to separate?” Kim Mulkey, Baylor’s coach, said. “I don’t know. Can we sustain it financially? I don’t know. But those are discussions that need to be had at the higher levels by people who are a lot smarter than me.” VanDerveer said she simply wanted to see more input from players and coaches, offering them “more of a voice so that someone can say, ‘Hey, the weight room doesn’t make any sense.’” And then there is Rush, the pioneering coach at Immaculata, who said she believed the N.C.A.A. had “worked well” and even proved “transformational” for women’s sports. But she had a caveat. “I’m not sure better is the answer.” Susan C. Beachy  contributed research."
"Gonzaga Was Finally, Truly Tested. It Passed With a Buzzer-Beater Over U.C.L.A.",sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/sports/ncaabasketball/gonzaga-ucla-final-four-buzzer-beater.html,"INDIANAPOLIS — As Gonzaga made its way through this pandemic season, with its stops and starts and tenor of uncertainty, it eyed an opportunity to stamp the season with a different sort of historical marker — an unbeaten season. Since the start, when they began the season as the top-ranked team in the country, the Zags rolled over every obstacle put in their path, a scintillating offense eviscerating every opponent and showing almost no signs of vulnerability during their nearly three-week stay here for the N.C.A.A. men’s tournament. Then late Saturday night, the Zags did what they hadn’t had to do all season — survive. And they did so in spectacular fashion, with Jalen Suggs banking in a 40-footer at the buzzer to give Gonzaga a 93-90 overtime victory over U.C.L.A. in a national semifinal at Lucas Oil Stadium. Suggs’ shot, with two Bruins in front of him, came after Johnny Juzang had erased the last of a 5-point deficit in the final minute of the extra period by following his own miss, the last of his game-high 29 points. Suggs took the inbound pass from Corey Kispert and after a couple dribbles launched his shot from just past midcourt. As it went through, Suggs raced across the court from the Gonzaga bench, leapt atop a table and thrust his fists in the air as his teammates gave chase. Meanwhile on the court, the Bruins stood in disbelief, hands on their heads or the hips. As Gonzaga Coach Mark Few walked to midcourt to shake hands with Mick Cronin, his counterpart, all he could do was hold his arms out and shrug before the two embraced. “I was just thinking, ‘please, please go in,’ I don’t want to go to another overtime,” Suggs said. The shot is sure to be a defining moment in tournament history, the way   and the way  , when his halfcourt heave came within a kind bounce of giving Butler the title here in Indianapolis. “It’s crazy,” Suggs said. “Again, like I said, to actually live out that moment — oh, my gosh. Right now, I’m tripping. I still don’t believe it. It’s not going to kick in until the morning.” Perhaps then it will be time to look ahead. Gonzaga, which is 31-0, advances to play Baylor on Monday night — a matchup between the two best teams in the country for most of the season and a redux of their scheduled matchup in Indianapolis in early December that was wiped out 90 minutes before tipoff because of positive coronavirus tests within the Bears’ traveling party. The game will have a hard time being as riveting as the Bulldogs’ win over the 11th-seeded Bruins, who entered the game as two-touchdown underdogs, the biggest spread in a Final Four game in 25 years. The Bulldogs will be attempting to become the first team since 1976 to win a championship with an undefeated season. Two teams had reached the semifinals unbeaten since Indiana, but that’s where runs ended for Nevada-Las Vegas in 1991, when it was shocked by Duke, and Kentucky in 2015, when it went down to Wisconsin. Gonzaga had looked just as formidable all season as those U.N.L.V. and Kentucky teams, which were stocked with future pros. The Zags had only one game closer than double digits — back in early December — and they had rolled into the Final Four with victories by 43, 16, 18 and 19 points. Coach after coach who looked at Gonzaga’s film came away with a sobering assessment: they were the best passing team they’d ever seen in college basketball. Center Drew Timme was lethal around the basket and if teams dared double team him, he was an able passer and soon the ball was buzzing around the perimeter until the desired result was achieved: a layup or an uncontested 3-pointer. But the Zags nearly met their match in the Bruins, who with their rich basketball history and record 11 men’s national championships, were in the unaccustomed role of long shots. U.C.L.A. entered the tournament on a four-game losing skid, and had to first get through a play-in game against Michigan State, which it beat in overtime to reach the round of 64. The Bruins then upset second-seeded Alabama, again in overtime, and knocked off top-seeded Michigan with a late defensive stand. They nearly pulled off their biggest shocker on Saturday night. Cronin had three objectives: keep the pace controlled, minimize turnovers that would fuel Gonzaga’s fast break and play the same unyielding defense that had gotten them to this point. They executed almost perfectly — and were urged on by a contingent of U.C.L.A fans that included two members of their last title team in 1995: Tyus Edney and Toby Bailey. It made for tense, riveting theater almost from the opening tip-off — with 15 ties and 19 lead changes — and only got more dramatic as the night wore on. “We might not have been the best team in the country all year, but we became one of the best four teams in the country, period,” Cronin said. “This was not a fluke tonight. We would not have gotten blown out Monday night. We didn’t sneak in.” If Suggs won the game with his long shot, he may have saved it with his defense, preventing U.C.L.A from taking the lead late in regulation when he swooped in to block U.C.L.A. center Cody Riley’s shot at the rim inside the final minute. The Bruins did have a chance to win it as their star, Juzang, who played the entire game, wound his way through the Gonzaga defense in the final seconds of regulation. But he was whistled for charging into center Drew Timme when he landed in a heap among a trio of Zags under the basket with 1.1 seconds left. “I would say this, it’s the hardest play in the world for an official,” Cronin said. “And if I see the film and it looked like the guy was moving, then sometimes things aren’t meant to be.” The call not only prevented Juzang, a 90-percent free-throw shooter, from going to the line; it kept Timme, who picked up his fourth foul with 4 minutes, 41 seconds left in regulation, in the game. Timme, who finished with 25 points, scored Gonzaga’s first 6 points of the extra period to put the Bulldogs ahead, 87-83. U.C.L.A. drew closer when Riley, after Tyger Campbell drew the defense, sank a baseline jumper, and it had a chance to tie on its next possession but Juzang missed a short transition floater with 1 minute, 38 seconds remaining in overtime. Andrew Nembhard seemed to put Gonzaga in control when he knocked in a 3-pointer less than 30 seconds later to put Gonzaga ahead by 90-85. But the Bruins, as they have done all tournament, had an answer. Coming out of a timeout, Jaquez, who had 19 points, knocked in a 3-pointer from the wing to draw the Bruins within 90-88 with 48 seconds left. When Kispert missed a 3-pointer, the Bruins hustled into the frontcourt and put the ball in the hands of their best player, Juzang, who drove into the lane and missed a short jumper, but collected the rebound and put it back in. The Zags’ undoing in years past has often been talented opponents with a physical, relentless defense. On nights when their free-flowing offense couldn’t escape the muck, they have rarely had the type of defense that could win those types of games. It is what undid Gonzaga in their last tournament appearance two years ago, when as a No. 1 seed they were upset by Texas Tech in the West regional final. This year, Few insisted, was different. The Zags, analytically at least, rated as among the nation’s best defenses and in Suggs, a freshman, they had what has for them been a rare player — an elite athlete with a football player’s mentality. The problem against the Bruins is that there was only one of him. U.C.L.A. was able to isolate Juzang on whoever was guarding him or let Cody Riley, the Bruins’ bulky left-handed center, draw Timme out of the paint and shoot jumpers over him. They also picked on Kispert, who was a defensive millstone. Yet, when it mattered most for Gonzaga, it wasn’t the defense that saved its season. It was a prayer from the heavens."
,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/business/american-airlines-dell-texas-voting-bills.html,"More large companies have voiced their opposition to Republican-led efforts to restrict voting, this time in Texas. On Thursday, American Airlines and Dell Technologies declared their objections to proposals in the state that would restrict local measures intended to make voting easier, such as by extending early voting hours. The pushback in Texas came just a day after  , though both companies waited until after Georgia’s governor had already signed the law to criticize it. “I need to make it crystal clear that the final bill is unacceptable and does not match Delta’s values,” Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief executive, wrote in an internal memo to employees on Wednesday that the company has posted on its website. Delta is   largest employer. The language was much stronger than Delta had used in advance of the passage of the law, when the company made only general statements in support of voting rights but declined to take a position on the legislation.  , which had also declined to take a position on the legislation before it passed, made a similarly worded statement. Those comments came a day after a group of Black executives, led by the former chief executive of American Express and the current chief executive of the drugmaker Merck, called on companies to oppose proposed   making it more difficult to vote across the country — saying that they would particularly impact the voting rights of Black Americans. On Thursday, American Airlines and Dell each addressed separate bills making their way through the Texas legislature. “Earlier this morning, the Texas State Senate passed legislation with provisions that limit voting access, ” the airline said in a statement on Thursday, referring to Senate Bill 7. “To make American’s stance clear: We are strongly opposed to this bill and others like it.” Michael Dell, the chief executive of the Round Rock, Texas-based company that bears his name, took to Twitter to voice his company’s opposition to House Bill 6, a measure that would stop local election officials from proactively sending out applications for mail-in ballots. “Free, fair, equitable access to voting is the foundation of American democracy,” Mr. Dell wrote on Thursday. “Those rights — especially for women, communities of color — have been hard-earned. Governments should ensure citizens have their voices heard. HB6 does the opposite, and we are opposed to it.” Southwest Airlines, which is based in Dallas, declined to comment on specific legislation. “In our view, the right to vote is foundational to our democracy and a right coveted by all,” the company said in a statement on Friday. “We believe every voter should have a fair opportunity to let their voice be heard.”"

Ms. Mawakana was Waymo’s chief operating officer, and Mr. Dolgov was the company’s chief technology officer before the promotion. In a   Mr. Krafcik, 59, did not specify a reason for why he was stepping down at this moment other than to say he was pursuing “new adventures.” Waymo said it was Mr. Krafcik’s decision and that he plans to remain an adviser to the company.

In the workplace, this means that you and your white colleagues do not have the same job. They get to focus solely on their work while, all too often, you have to do the work for which you were hired and the work of diversity, equity and inclusion, a specialized field you probably have no training in. I understand why you’re trying to raise awareness of D.E.I. and make your employer establish a structured plan. And I imagine it is very lonely being the only person who is willing to do this work. Unfortunately, there is little that we can do to make people care about these issues. At some point, you have to decide how long you’re going to do this extra work for colleagues who aren’t willing to meet you even halfway. Of course you feel resentful. This is an absurd situation and one that you should not have to deal with. As for your colleague, it is the height of privilege to be able to avoid the discomfort of discussing difficult issues. So much important work toward change happens in the uncomfortable moments where we are forced to confront the things that challenge us. Your colleague asserted that “this is the world of classical music.” What does that even mean? People of color both create and consume classical music. I would suggest starting small with the change that you want to see. Perhaps you can organize programs for your colleagues that can help educate them about classical musicians and composers of color, like Scott Joplin, Florence Beatrice Price, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and George Bridgetower, and contemporary artists, like Lara Downes, Wynton Marsalis and Jessie Montgomery. That said, you can do only so much and, frankly, you have done enough. You may well be surrounded by people who are unwilling or uninterested in living in the real world where diversity exists. If that’s the case, it could be that you need to move on to an organization whose values are more aligned with yours. Your manager is passive aggressive and has some toxic ideas about work culture. I don’t know that she was shaming you as much as she was judging you, which isn’t much better. But who cares what she thinks? You’re stressed out. Most people are. Your manager is just being petty. Ignore her silly provocations. You’ve been at your organization for more than 30 years. You can see the light at the end of the employment tunnel. You can and will get through this. If you have the energy for it, you can certainly look for new employment. Or you can just stick it out. You didn’t share how much longer you have to work to qualify for Social Security benefits, but I am guessing it’s fewer than 10 years. It’s time to figure out who you are beyond your work. You can be great at your job without being a workaholic. Keep doing your best, but find other things outside of work to put some of that intensity into. As I’ve written before in this column, the job will never love you. Do not invest the whole of your identity in what you do for a living because when the job refuses to love you back, when it lets you down, you’re left with nothing and you deserve much better. Your new employee is not taking money out of your bank account. Why are you so pressed about her negotiating tactics or how much she is being paid? You don’t know for certain that she is lying about the competing offer but, if she is, she is not the first nor will she be the last person to manifest an imaginary job offer to negotiate higher compensation. It sounds as if she was savvy, did her homework and shot her shot. Let go of the feeling that she lied and circumvented your authority. She has hustle. She will, hopefully, bring that hustle to the job every day and be a great employee. If not, you will handle the matter accordingly. I understand why you are irked about the way she went about this, but that’s your bruised ego talking. Nurse the bruise and move on. You’re still the boss. ."
What to Know About the C.D.C. Guidelines on Vaccinated Travel,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/travel/cdc-vaccinated-travel.html,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for fully vaccinated Americans on Friday, saying that traveling both domestically and internationally was low risk. The long-awaited recommendations were issued by federal health officials after a series of studies found that vaccines administered in the United States were robustly effective in preventing infections in real-life conditions. Still, the C.D.C. is not recommending travel at this time because of the  of the coronavirus, both at home and abroad. One is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving the single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, or two weeks after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna shots. If you decide to travel, you might still have some questions. Here are the answers. Yes. Under federal law, masks must be worn at airports, onboard domestic U.S. flights and in all transport hubs. The C.D.C. says that as long as coronavirus measures are taken, including mask wearing, fully vaccinated Americans can travel domestically without having to take a test or quarantine, although the agency warns that some states and territories may keep their local travel restrictions and recommendations in place. For those wishing to travel internationally, a coronavirus test will not be required before departure from the United States unless mandated by the government of their destination. Vaccinated travelers will, however, need to show a negative Covid-19 viral test before returning to the United States, and are advised to take a test three to five days after their return, but will not need to self-quarantine. Yes, but only to countries that will have you.   although some countries such as Iceland are allowing in vaccinated visitors from the United States and elsewhere. Other places like Turkey, Croatia and Montenegro and have been welcoming Americans with negative test results, while Greece plans to open up to fully vaccinated tourists and other foreigners with a negative test in May. Many Caribbean nations have reopened to American tourists, but each has its own coronavirus protocols and entry requirements. of countries Americans can travel to. Domestic travel has been complicated this past year, with the states and territories instituting their own travel restrictions and recommendations throughout the pandemic (and frequently updating them). If you are fully vaccinated, the C.D.C. says you can travel freely within the United States and that you do not need to get tested, or self-quarantine, before or after traveling. But some states and local governments may choose to keep travel restrictions in place, including testing, quarantine and stay-at-home orders. Before you travel across state lines, check the current rules at your destination and whether the state is waiving testing and quarantines for vaccinated people. You can find a list of current restrictions  . Right now, the best way to prove that you have been vaccinated is to show  Digital vaccine and health certificates showing that people have been vaccinated or tested are in  and are expected, eventually, to be widely used to speed up travel. The subject of “vaccine passports” is currently one of the most hotly debated topics within the travel industry, with questions over the equity of their use and concerns over health and data privacy. On Friday, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida   that would ban local governments and state businesses from requiring proof of vaccination for services. Last month, the European Union   but individual European countries are still expected to set their own rules for travel requirements this summer. The C.D.C. advises people against travel unless they have been vaccinated. If you must travel, the agency recommends testing one to three days before a trip and following all coronavirus guidance at your destination. No vaccine has yet been approved for children under the age of 16,  have found the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine to be extremely effective in young adolescents aged 12-15. All air passengers aged two and older coming into the United States, including fully vaccinated people, are required to have a negative Covid-19 test result taken no more than three days before they board their flight. The United States inoculation rollout has been among the fastest in the world, but there is a stark gap between its rapid rollout and the vaccination programs in different countries. Some nations have yet to report a single dose being administered. Many countries are currently seeing a surge in new cases and are implementing strict coronavirus protocols, including mask mandates in public spaces, capacity limits at restaurants and tourist sites and other lockdown restrictions. It is important to check coronavirus case rates, measures and medical infrastructure before traveling to your destination and not to let your guard down when you get there. Even though you are fully vaccinated, you may still be able to transmit the disease to local communities who have not yet been inoculated. You can track coronavirus vaccination rollouts around the world "
"Fully Vaccinated Americans Can Travel With Low Risk, C.D.C. Says",business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/health/cdc-travel-vaccinations.html,"Americans who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 can safely travel at home and abroad, as long as they take basic precautions like wearing masks, federal health officials announced on Friday, a long-awaited change from the dire government warnings that have kept many millions home for the past year. In announcing the change at a White House news conference, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stressed that they preferred that people avoid travel. But they said growing evidence of the real-world effectiveness of the vaccines — which have been given to more than 100 million Americans — suggested that inoculated people could do so “at low risk to themselves.” The shift in the C.D.C.’s official stance comes at a moment of both hope and peril in the pandemic. The pace of vaccinations has been rapidly accelerating across the country, and the number of deaths has been declining. Yet cases are increasing significantly in many states as new variants of the coronavirus spread through the country. Just last Monday, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, warned of a potential fourth wave if states and cities continued to loosen public health restrictions, telling reporters that she had feelings of “impending doom.” Some public health experts were surprised by Friday’s announcement and expressed concern that government was sending confusing signals to the public. “It’s a mix of ‘please don’t travel,’ at the same time this is easing travel for a subset of people,” said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. “I think it’s very confusing and goes counter to the message we heard earlier this week, to ‘stay put,’ ‘hold on,’ ‘be patient.’ And that worries me. Public health messaging has to be very clear, very consistent, and it has to be very simple.” Dr. Walensky herself seemed to acknowledge the apparent mixed messaging during Friday’s news conference.  The science shows us that getting fully vaccinated allows you to do more things safely, and it’s important for us to provide that guidance even in the context of rising cases,” she said. The travel industry welcomed the new guidance, hoping it might be the beginning of a turn of fortune for airlines, hotels and tourist destinations, which have suffered mounting losses for more than a year. “As travel comes back, U.S. jobs come back,” said Roger Dow, the chief executive of the U.S. Travel Association, an industry group, said in a statement. Federal officials remained adamant that people who have not been fully vaccinated should not travel at all, a position widely supported by public health experts. “If you are fully vaccinated, you can return to travel, but if you are not, there is still a lot of virus circulating and it is still a risky undertaking and you should defer until you get vaccinated or the situation improves,” said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. If unvaccinated people must travel, the C.D.C. recommends they be tested for coronavirus infection one to three days before their trip and again three to five days after it’s over. They should self-quarantine for seven days after a trip if they get tested and for 10 days if they do not get tested, the agency said. People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving the single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, or two weeks after receiving the second dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna shot. Some 58 million people in the U.S., 22 percent of the adult population, have been fully vaccinated, according to the latest numbers from the C.D.C. Scientists are still not certain whether vaccinated people may become infected, even briefly, and transmit the virus to others. A recent C.D.C. study  , but until that question is resolved, many public health officials feel it is unwise to tell vaccinated Americans simply to do as they please. They say it is important for all vaccinated people to continue to wear masks, practice social distancing and take other precautions. Under the new C.D.C. guidance, fully vaccinated Americans who are traveling domestically do not need to be tested for the coronavirus or follow quarantine procedures at the destination or after returning home. When they travel abroad, they only need to get a coronavirus test or quarantine if the country they are going to requires it. However, the guidance says they must have a negative   before boarding a flight back to the United States, and they should get tested again three to five days after their return. The recommendation is predicated on the idea that   The C.D.C. also cited a lack of vaccine coverage in other countries, and concern about the potential introduction and spread of new variants of the virus that are more prevalent overseas. Most states have accelerated their timelines for opening vaccinations to all adults, as the pace of vaccinations across the country has been increasing. As of Friday, an average of nearly three million shots a day were being administered,  The new advice adds to C.D.C. recommendations issued in early March saying that  in private settings without masks or social distancing, and may visit with unvaccinated individuals from a single household as long as they are at low risk for developing severe disease if infected with the virus. Travel has already been increasing nationwide, as the weather warms and Americans grow fatigued with pandemic restrictions. Last Sunday was the busiest day at domestic airports since the pandemic began. According to the Transportation Security Administration, nearly 1.6 million people passed through the security checkpoints at American airports. But the industry’s concerns are far from over. The pandemic has also shown businesses large and small that their employees can often be just as productive working remotely as in face-to-face meetings. As a result, the airline and hotel industries expect it will be years before lucrative corporate travel recovers to prepandemic levels, leaving a gaping hole in revenues. And while leisure travel within the United States may be recovering steadily, airlines expect it will still take until 2023 or 2024 for passenger volumes to reach 2019 levels, according to Airlines for America, an industry group. The industry lost more than $35 billion last year and continues to lose tens of millions of dollars each day, the group said. Many countries, including those in the European Union, still block most Americans from coming. Some are starting to make exceptions for those who are vaccinated. As of March 26, fully vaccinated Americans who can present proof of vaccination can visit Iceland, for example, and avoid such restrictions as testing and quarantine,  The C.D.C. on Thursday also issued more detailed technical instructions for cruise lines, requiring them to take steps to develop vaccination strategies and make plans for routine testing of crew members and daily reporting of Covid-19 cases before they can run simulated trial runs of voyages with volunteers, before taking on real passengers. The C.D.C.’s directives acknowledge that taking cruises “will always pose some risk of Covid-19 transmission.” Some destinations and cruise lines have already started requiring that travelers be fully vaccinated. The cruise line Royal Caribbean is requiring passengers and crew members 18 or older to be vaccinated in order to board its ships, as are Virgin Voyages, Crystal Cruises and others. For the moment, airlines are not requiring vaccinations for travel. But the idea has been much talked about in the industry. Niraj Chokshi contributed reporting."
Pinterest Is Said to Be in Talks to Acquire the Photo App VSCO,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/technology/pinterest-vsco.html,"SAN FRANCISCO —   has held talks to buy  , a photography app that spawned a teenage social media craze, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The discussions are ongoing, said the people, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly. A deal price couldn’t be learned; Pinterest has a market capitalization of about $49 billion, while VSCO has raised $90 million in funding and was last valued at $550 million. An acquisition may not materialize, the people cautioned. Representatives from Pinterest and VSCO (pronounced “vis-coe”) declined to comment on deal talks. Julie Inouye, a spokeswoman for VSCO, said the company was focused on expanding its business. “We’re always meeting with different companies across the creative space at any given time and do not discuss rumors or speculation,” she said. Pinterest and VSCO, which stands for Visual Supply Company, are part of a group of tech companies that are highly focused on digital images and visual editing and that rely less on social networking features. Pinterest, a digital pin board site that  , lets its users discover and save images to inspire creative projects or to plan important aspects of their lives, including home renovations, weddings and meals. VSCO, a 10-year-old start-up, makes   for editing and sharing images and videos. In 2019, it became popular with a Generation Z group that came to be known as “ ,” who were known for wearing Crocs and carrying Hydro Flasks. The idea of VSCO girls went viral, inspiring social media imitation, mockery, memes and Halloween costumes. For Pinterest, buying a once-buzzy start-up that was popular with younger audiences and that has expertise in photo- and video-editing technologies could bolster its core service, the people said. Since Pinterest went public, its revenue has grown, though analysts have said they don’t expect Pinterest to become regularly profitable until 2022. It has also expanded internationally.  During the pandemic, the company experienced a surge of interest as people were locked down and turned to more digital activities. Pinterest added 100 million monthly active users last year and now has a total of 450 million monthly active users. The San Francisco company also faced social unrest last year. In December, it agreed to pay $22.5 million to settle  from its former chief operating officer, one of the largest publicly announced individual settlements for gender discrimination. Two female employees of color who quit last year also publicly discussed their experiences with racist and sexist comments, pay inequities and retaliation at the company. Founded in 2011, VSCO became known among younger users as a kind of anti-social network. The app does not have likes, comments or follower counts, so it appeared to put less pressure on users to build up a fan base. VSCO also eschews advertising, instead earning money by charging people for extra features. Of its 100 million registered users, more than two million are paying subscribers. When VSCO girls became a cultural phenomenon in late 2019, investor interest in the start-up swelled. But the fad has since cooled off. When the pandemic hit, VSCO laid off 30 percent of its employees. In December, it acquired Trash, a mobile app for video editing, and said it planned to continue acquiring companies in 2021."
,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/business/super-mario-bros-nintendo-auction.html,"An unopened copy of Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros. that had been bought in 1986 as a Christmas gift but sat forgotten in a desk drawer until recently was sold on Friday for $660,000, according to an auction house in Dallas. The price was a record for a video game, the auction house, Heritage Auctions,  . That distinction was previously held by another copy of the same game, which sold for $114,000 in July. The game that sold on Friday was purchased as a Christmas gift in 1986 but it had been placed in a desk drawer, where it remained undisturbed for 35 years, the statement said. “It stayed in the bottom of my office desk this whole time since the day I bought it,” the seller, who asked not to be identified, told Heritage Auctions. “I never thought anything about it.” Valarie McLeckie, who oversees video game sales at Heritage Auctions, said that the game was produced in late 1986 during a brief period when the games were sealed with plastic shrink wrap, rather than sticker seal, and before another packaging variation was introduced in 1987. “Since the production window for this copy and others like it was so short, finding another copy from this same production run in similar condition would be akin to looking for a single drop of water in an ocean,” Ms. McLeckie said in the statement. “Never say never, but there’s a good chance it can’t be done.” Details about the winning bidder were not immediately available on Saturday. The auction website allows bidders to make offers to the new owner, starting at $990,000 or more. Heritage Auctions called it the “finest known copy” of the game, with even the perforated cardboard hangtab intact. The opening bid at the auction was $310,000. , and games for the Nintendo Entertainment System are often the hottest investments. Collectors have been able to quickly flip titles for thousands of dollars in profits. , an iconic, fan-favorite video game that has since spawned multiple variations, was first produced in 1986. It features two brothers, Mario and Luigi, who live in the Mushroom Kingdom and are charged with rescuing Princess Toadstool, who has been kidnapped by Bowser, the king of the Koopa. Complete with a recognizable theme song, Mario has remained a popular character among fans for decades. According to the narrative from the original instruction booklet, the kingdom of the peaceful Mushroom People had been invaded by the Koopa, a tribe of turtles who turned the “quiet, peace-loving” Mushroom People into stones, bricks and plants. The only person who can reverse the magic spell is Princess Toadstool, the daughter of the Mushroom King. In the game, players guide Mario on a quest to free the princess and save the kingdom of the Mushroom People. He navigates eight levels filled with giant mushrooms, menacing turtles and other strange obstacles. “You are Mario! It’s up to you to save the Mushroom People from the black magic of the Koopa!” the original instructions tell players. Since Super Mario Bros. debuted, the brothers have been featured in numerous games, saving new lands and rescuing more princesses, including Super Mario Sunshine, Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Odyssey. The most recent,  , was released in February for the Nintendo Switch system. Mario’s presence expands beyond the video game world, too. In March,   opened at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka. Visitors can walk through the familiar green pipe at the park’s entrance, explore Princess Peach’s castle and eat burgers inside a giant mushroom, all with the Mario theme song playing in the background. Super Nintendo World parks also have been planned for Singapore and the United States. Given Mario’s popularity and the successful sale of the similarly rare copy of Super Mario Bros. for more than $100,000, Heritage Auctions had expected to draw a high price for the copy on Friday, Ms. McLeckie said. “Even so, the degree to which this game was embraced outside the market has been nothing short of exceptional, and that aspect of this sale has certainly exceeded our expectations,” Ms. McLeckie said. “Though, I suppose we can’t be too shocked: Who doesn’t love Mario?”"
Driving Less? Make Sure Your Car Hasn’t Deteriorated During Lockdown,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/at-home/car-maintenance-lockdown.html,"You may have put off going to the doctor, the dentist, getting hair cuts, abandoned your commute and reduced your driving to essential errands during the pandemic. Staying put has most likely made you safer, but you weren’t doing any favors for your car, especially if you were also putting off maintenance. Cars need regular use and upkeep to stay in shape, even if you are barely driving them. Make that: Especially if you’re barely driving them. That said, there is some car maintenance you can delay and some you cannot. The “can” list is shorter, so let’s start with that. Maintenance obligations can be loosely divided into two categories: those based on miles driven and those based on time since the last service. One of the chores based on miles is tire rotation, and a car that has barely been used can relax the routine that’s intended to even out the wear on all four tires. Usually, after about 5,000 miles you would move the positions of the tires, like putting the right front tire on the right rear, though the pattern to follow can differ from car to car. Also, while deteriorate over time, the past year of diminished use won’t have much affect on that deterioration. You can also relax about the engine coolant and the air and cabin filters, which are all tied to usage. John Ibbotson, the shop supervisor for the auto fleet of Consumer Reports, said that some automakers don’t call for the system to be flushed and new coolant installed until 100,000 miles, or 10 years. He also said the filters should typically be “looked at every 15,000 miles and changed at 30,000.” The general maintenance guidance he relies on is the owner’s manual, but he cautions that the patterns of life in the pandemic have complicated matters. With people driving only short local trips, the typical family car has shifted from normal service to what automakers regard as severe duty. In other words, making those quick hops to the Starbucks may be functionally the equivalent of towing a trailer or pounding down dusty farm roads, as far as your engine’s oil is concerned. Short trips do not bring the engine up to operating temperature, which is necessary to rid the oil of moisture that accumulates in normal use. Nor does the engine coolant circulate and deliver anti-corrosion additives to vital spots. Longer drives also help make sure that vital components like gears and bearings maintain a coating of lubricant. If you are not taking longer drives, then you really don’t want to delay changing your oil. It’s the most familiar maintenance task and perhaps the one that is most important to your car’s good health.  On an older car, following the owner’s manual mileage recommendation for severe conditions will help to keep the lubricant and its blend of protective additives fresh (if you no longer have the manual, they are often available online and from the automaker). The systems built into many new cars that remind you of required service, like oil changes, take into account the length of trips and will recommend changes based on actual driving. Changing the oil is also the ideal time to look in on other maintenance tasks, including checks of all belts and hoses; while both suffer the effects of engine heat under the hood, they can also develop cracks while the car just sits. Add car batteries to the time list. They have a limited life that’s not based on miles driven. They often start to decline after three years and give up altogether after  . , a certified technician and vice president for marketing at  , a website that provides cost estimates and connects car owners with qualified mechanic shops, knows how to properly care for a car. Yet even she let a battery run down past the point where it could be revived with a charge, which is exactly what happened to her 2014 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid when it sat in the driveway for months without being driven during the pandemic. The solution: a low-power battery maintainer, which keeps the charge topped up between drives. Basic ones start at about $25. Keep in mind, too, that while battery replacement is an entirely straightforward swap on most cars, some electronics-intensive models make it more painful. BMWs going back nearly two decades require a registration and programming process, which means added expense and a possible visit to a dealer. It’s worth preventing a dead battery in the first place. Another maintenance task that should not be deferred is replacing the timing belt in engines that use them. The belt turns the camshafts that open the engine’s valves and can cause major engine damage if it fails. Typically good for 80,000 to 100,000 miles of service, the belt can degrade even while sitting, so stick to the automaker’s recommendation on years between renewal. A telling sign of a car not being driven is a layer of rust on the brake discs. A light coating is no problem, though it may be noisy for a few blocks; it will be polished off by the first few presses of the brake pedal on a careful drive around the neighborhood. More critical are brake parts you can’t see. The hydraulic fluid that makes the system work absorbs water from the air, potentially reducing stopping power. The fluid can be tested for water, but if it’s visibly dirty have the system flushed and refilled with fluid that meets the specifications in the owner’s manual. Also look for corrosion that can keep the brake calipers, which squeeze the discs to stop the car, from working correctly. If your car doesn’t roll freely at low speeds when driven for the first time in awhile, have the brakes checked immediately — and ideally nearby. One downside to dormancy that doesn’t fall under normal maintenance routines: rodent occupation. Lift the hood to see whether mice or squirrels have taken up residence, a problem that may be more common than you’d think. Clear out any nesting materials or droppings before starting the engine, especially from areas near an exhaust system that will get hot. At the same time, knock off accumulations of dirt, leaves and bird droppings, which can damage the paint. Ms. Trotta suggested a gentle pass with a yard blower; in any case, don’t rub accumulated dirt with a cloth or a brush because the abrasion will leave scratches. You can also rinse the surface with plain water to remove as much as possible. Pay attention to the tracks where a sunroof or the power windows slide, clearing debris that could jam the glass. The yearlong hiatus in regular car use calls for a bit of special attention to the car’s mechanical and cosmetic needs, but for the most part it is not disastrous for every aspect of a car’s well-being. As Covid restrictions loosen around the country and with warmer weather, drivers will be putting their vehicles back into regular service, and there may be a crush at the local shop or dealership. Taking care of deferred maintenance soon may be a smart plan to avoid a wait for service."
,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/business/ppp-loans-minority-businesses.html,"Southern Bancorp is a lender serving the Arkansas and Mississippi Delta, where poverty rates are among the highest in America and decades of redlining shaped neighborhoods with little generational wealth. When the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses started last April, so many of Southern Bancorp’s customers didn’t qualify for the relief money that the Arkansas bank’s chief executive, Darrin Williams, turned to donors to raise money for $1,000 grants so it wouldn’t have to turn applicants away empty-handed. The bank made 128 such grants, giving more than 100 of them to businesses run by women or minority owners. One let a nail salon owner buy plexiglass so she could reopen. Another allowed a small cafe to buy safety gear for its staff. A day care used the money for the new sanitizing equipment it needed. “So many companies will never come back, and disproportionately more of those that will be lost are Black and brown businesses,” Mr. Williams said. Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program in March 2020 as an emergency stopgap for what lawmakers expected to be a few months of sharp economic disruption. But as the pandemic raged on, the program — which made its first loans one year ago this past week — has turned into the largest small-business support program in American history, sending $734 billion in forgivable loans to struggling companies. The program helped nearly seven million businesses retain workers. But it has also been plagued by complex, changing rules at every stage of its existence. And one year in, it has become clear that the program’s hasty rollout and design hurt some of the most vulnerable businesses. A New York Times analysis of data from several sources — including the Small Business Administration, which is managing the loan program — and interviews with dozens of small businesses and bankers show that Black- and other minority-owned businesses were disproportionately underserved by the relief effort, often because they lacked the connections to get access to the aid or were rejected because of the program’s rules. After Congress created the program in last year’s CARES Act, President Donald J. Trump’s administration — especially his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin — put a priority on getting money to needy businesses fast. Just seven days after the law was signed, the  . But the haste meant the rules were mostly written on the fly. Reaching harder-to-serve businesses was an afterthought. Lenders and advocacy groups warned that the relief effort had structural challenges that were likely to inadvertently but disproportionately harm women and minority business owners. Reaching the most vulnerable businesses required determination, they said, and the program gave lenders no incentives to put in that effort. The government relied on banks to make the loans, creating  . Some banks  , which pushed ordinary customers to the back of the queue. “Mystery shopper” studies found that   than white counterparts. The program also largely locked out sole proprietors and independent contractors — two of the most popular structures for minority-owned businesses. Those companies weren’t eligible to apply for the program’s first week. When they got access,   — a restriction that didn’t apply to larger companies — prevented many from getting help. Most nonbank lenders, including those that specialize in underserved communities, were shut out for weeks while they waited for the Small Business Administration to approve them. “The focus at the outset was on speed, and it came at the expense of equity,” said Ashley Harrington, the federal advocacy director at the Center for Responsible Lending. In the program’s final weeks — it is scheduled to stop taking applications on May 31 — President Biden’s administration has tried to alter its trajectory with   intended to funnel more money toward women- and minority-led businesses, especially those with only a handful of employees. Mr. Biden   last week as he signed a bill extending the program’s deadline. “Many small businesses, as you know, particularly Hispanic as well as African-American small businesses, are just out of business because they got bypassed the first time around,” the president said. But Mr. Biden’s revisions — which, most prominently, expanded lending to independent contractors and others who work for themselves — have  , including the speed with which they were rushed through. Lenders, caught off guard, struggled to carry them out, with little time left before the deadline. “The rules are complicated and constantly changing, and that alone creates an access barrier,” Randell Leach, the chief executive of Beneficial State Bank in Oakland, Calif. Because lenders are not required to collect demographic details on their borrowers, data on the Paycheck Protection Program’s racial breakdown has been scarce, but economists have consistently found signs of gaps. An   noted that some counties with large numbers of Black-owned businesses — most notably the Bronx, Queens and Wayne County, Mich., which includes Detroit — had strikingly low concentrations of the relief loans. Majority-white ZIP codes in several metropolitan areas had higher loan coverage than ZIP codes with heavily minority populations, according to   released last month. And data from the Small Business Administration shows the relief effort’s tilt. The vast majority of lenders did not report demographic data on the 3.6 million loans they made this year, but of the 996,000 that included information on the borrower’s race, 71 percent of the dollars went to white-owned businesses. Pilar Guzman Zavala founded  , a small chain of restaurants, in Florida 12 years ago. She employed 100 people before the pandemic and had established bank accounts and years of detailed business records. But Ms. Zavala’s application stalled at the first two lenders she tried, forcing her to spend a month hunting before she finally found a local bank that would process her loan. She’s grateful for the aid, which helped her hold on to 50 workers, but found the process infuriating. “The financial system doesn’t get to truly small business, Hispanic businesses, women-owned businesses. It just doesn’t,” she said. Of the 1,300 Paycheck Protection Program loans that Southern Bancorp made last year, many went to customers who had been turned away by larger banks, Mr. Williams said. In a recent  , nearly 80 percent of small-business owners who are Black or of Asian descent said their companies were in weak financial shape, compared with 54 percent of white business owners. And Black owners face unique challenges. While owners from all other demographics told the Fed that their main problem at the moment was low customer demand, Black respondents cited a different top challenge: access to credit. When Jenell Ross, who runs   in Ohio, sought a Paycheck Protection Program loan, her longtime bank told her to look elsewhere — a message that large banks like Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo   in the program’s frenzied early days. Days later, she obtained a loan from Huntington Bank, a regional lender, but the experience stung. “Historically, access to capital has been the leading concern of women- and minority-owned businesses to survive, and during this pandemic it has been no different,” Ms. Ross, who is Black, told a House committee last year. Community lenders and aid organizations took a shoe-leather approach to filling the gaps. Last year, the American Business Immigration Coalition, an advocacy group, worked with local nonprofits to create a “community navigator” program that sent outreach workers to Black, minority and rural businesses in Florida, Illinois, South Carolina and Texas. They plowed through roadblocks, Whac-a-Mole-style. Language barriers were common. Many business owners had never sought a bank loan before. Several didn’t have an email address and needed help creating one. Some hadn’t filed taxes; the coalition hired two accountants to help people sort out their financials. “Our folks literally went door to door and walked people through the process,” said Rebecca Shi, the group’s executive director. “It’s time-consuming.” The group’s work netted $8 million in Paycheck Protection Program loans for 219 businesses. For those companies, the help made a profound difference. , a New York lender that focuses on historically disadvantaged communities, spent two hours of staff time, on average, on each of the 490 loans it made last year — far more than larger lenders put in. Dozens of its applications took 10 hours or more to complete, said James H. Bason, TruFund’s chief executive. Many of TruFund’s customers walked in the door after being turned away by large banks, where “not being able to speak to anybody at the bank, sitting around waiting to hear, and then not hearing anything for weeks — all of that created a lot of anxiety for our small-business borrowers,” Mr. Bason said. Shaundell Newsome, a Las Vegas business owner and a co-chair of  , an advocacy group, said improving outcomes for Black business owners would require deliberate, sustained changes throughout the banking industry. “The solution is intentionality,” he said. “What I mean by that is making sure bankers, regulators and policymakers stay intentional on building Black businesses and helping us get access to capital.” That’s a message Mr. Newsome passed on to Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen in a recent meeting. Ms. Yellen has pledged to increase support for minority-focused lenders and make other changes to alter a financial system that, in her words, still produces outcomes unacceptably similar to those of  . Economic crises like the one now gripping the country “hit people of color harder and longer” and intensify economic inequality, Ms. Yellen said at that meeting. “I am worried the current crisis will do this again. In fact, I know it will, unless we act.”"
"Fashion Trends Are Often Recycled. Now More Clothing Can Be, Too.",business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/fashion/sustainability-clothes-environment-technology.html,"Sustainability in the fashion industry was once the focus of only a handful of designers like Stella McCartney and outdoor gear companies such as Patagonia. But traditional and new brands are trying to improve a supply chain increasingly criticized for contributing to landfills and causing other forms of pollution throughout the manufacturing process. From collaborating on the creation of biofibers to the manufacturing of environmentally friendly tag fasteners, some in the apparel sector are working with technology start-ups to clean up the world’s closets. The biggest problem rests with the volume of unwanted clothing that winds up in landfills. According to the  , which works to foster sustainability, clothing production globally roughly doubled from 2000 to 2015. During the same period, the number of times a garment was worn declined by 36 percent. All told, “the equivalent of one garbage truck full of clothes is burned or dumped in a landfill every second,” their report found. Over roughly the same period, according to the  , 60 percent more garments were purchased, but consumers kept them for only half as long. But some companies, like H&M, are trying to increase their own sustainability while also encouraging consumers to keep garments out of the trash. At H&M’s flagship store in Stockholm, for example, customers can pay a nominal amount to have unwanted clothing transformed into new garments through a process that breaks down the old fibers and combines them with new ones. The eight-step process is designed to make a point, not a profit. “We want to engage our customers and make them understand that their own garments hold value,” said Pascal Brun, H&M’s head of sustainability. But traditional mechanical recycling that is in wider use has its limits. “As shiny as the fashion industry is on the outside, the supply chain has often relied on 19th-century equipment,” said Stacy Flynn, the founder of  , a start-up based in Seattle. Companies like Ms. Flynn’s seek to reduce fibers to their basic chemical components and build them back up with less impact. Evrnu’s first product, which Ms. Flynn said she hoped would become commercially available this year, converts the cotton in garments to lyocell, a cellulose fiber that is now made only from wood. The process, called NuCycl, will update the initial recycling step of sorting, grading and shredding fabric by adding a camera that can more accurately identify a fabric’s composition. Decorative trim, the content of the label or even the thread used can reduce the cotton content by as much as 20 percent. “It’s like the difference between cooking and baking — you can be looser with ingredients when cooking, but with baking you must be precise,” Ms. Flynn said. “It’s the same way with chemical recycling — if you know what you’ve got, you can optimize the process.” The heart of the technology lies in the next step, at the pulp mill, where the shredded fabric is dissolved and turned into pulp. That pulp becomes a thick paper, to be shipped to the next part of the textile supply chain, the fiber producers. There it is repolymerized to make lyocell. Evrnu has partnered with several brands, including Adidas and Ms. McCartney, to use the recycled fibers in their fabrics. “When the consumer is done with it or if the brand is stuck with a dog, those garments can all come back into the system, be repolymerized and turned into something new,” Ms. Flynn said. Another area of interest involves new fibers and materials that rely on products that are found in nature but not derived from animals. Several companies, for example, are developing alternatives to leather, since hides are particularly problematic, from the methane-producing cows that produce it to tanning methods that often involve toxic chemicals like chromium. Vegan leather, despite its environmentally friendly name, is no better because it uses plastic, said Theanne Schiros, a materials scientist and an assistant professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. One alternative is mushroom leather, which relies on mycelium, or mushroom roots, to produce an animal-free alternative. Mycelium has been used for thousands of years in a variety of ways, Dr. Schiros said, even to dress wounds, but   and designers have set their sights higher. In addition to Bolt Threads, a fiber and material producer that gained attention last fall when it announced its  , others companies, like  , are developing “leathers” from mycelium. MycoWorks’s chief executive, Matthew Scullin, said that while the company was exploring uses in automotive upholstery, the current emphasis was on apparel and footwear. F.I.T.’s Dr. Schiros is part of a team at Columbia University working on a bioleather alternative; the latest prototype, she said, is “a naturally dyed, microbe-grown sneaker that is a part of Slow Factory’s One x One initiative,” referring to the nonprofit that works on sustainability and climate issues. The pandemic has forced her to work from home, rather than at a lab, but she has found a clever workaround. She used her backyard to test how well the bioleather that had been treated with their plant-based tanning technology would break down — in this case, decomposition is a good thing. After burying the sample she tested the mass of the material, as well as the pH and the nutrients of the soil, for 60 days. Her home-based experiment, she said, found that after seven days the “samples had visibly deteriorated, were smaller in size and had lost over 70 percent of their mass.” Dr. Schiros is also a co-founder and the chief science officer of  , which is developing a wool fiber alternative.

That is the idea behind  , a footwear maker that uses primarily recycled materials, said the company’s co-founder Chloe Songer. Thousand Fell also wants to make it easier for consumers to recycle their shoes. “You can do some great design thinking and great production, but if you’re not set up to actively collect product, it’s a little bit in vain,” said Stuart Ahlum, the company’s co-founder. To that end, in November, Thousand Fell teamed up with UPS to provide consumers with an easier way to recycle their worn-out footwear. Ultimately these developments will transform the fashion world as long as customers buy in. The look and feel — as well as the price — have to work. “If we could make a shoe for $400 but no one buys it, it defeats the purpose,” Mr. Ahlum said. Additionally, being environmentally friendly is not enough. As Dr. Scullin of MycoWorks said: “There is an expectation floating around that consumers are willing to sacrifice quality for sustainability. But they’re not.”"
The Week in Business: Jobs Surge Back,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/business/the-week-in-business-jobs-economy.html,"Good morning and happy Easter. Here are the top stories in business and tech to know for the week ahead.  Employers  , more than doubling February’s employment growth.

And it will invest heavily in green initiatives like  . But the proposal faces  , as Republicans   that Mr. Biden says would pay for it.

Remote Learning Isn’t Just for Kids,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/education/online-learning-older-adults.html,"Deb Livingston, a former business consultant, was always curious and eager to learn just about anything. “When the pandemic hit, I was confined at home and found myself diving into online exploration,” said Ms. Livingston, 61. She discovered  , an interactive website that delivers virtual education to older adults. Even former chief executives like Jeff Mihm, a Miami resident who led Noven Pharmaceuticals, sometimes need a new life direction. After resigning from his corporate post, Mr. Mihm, 55, decided to go back to school — virtually, because of the pandemic — and enrolled in the University of Texas’s   in September. “I have a love of learning, and it was an opportunity to step back, study and explore,” he said. The internet has empowered adult learners by providing new online tools to ramp up education and training. “The need for workers to keep pace with fast-moving economic, cultural and technological changes, combined with longer careers, will add up to great swaths of adults who need to learn more than generations past — and faster than ever,” said Luke Yoquinto, a research associate at the M.I.T. AgeLab and co-author of “ .” By 2034, the number of adults age 65 and older will outnumber those under the age of 18, according to the  . “That growth of older age demographics will translate to new demand for enrichment in the form of digital education,” Mr. Yoquinto said. “I would say that, for both good and ill, older demographics are going to serve as a proving ground for learning technologies in the coming years.” Adult education, however, is “the Wild West” of education technology, according to Mr. Yoquinto. There are many outlets experimenting with ways to get a handle on the online adult education marketplace, including community colleges and universities, for-profit learning platforms, workshop providers and nonprofit organizations. The new platforms are also opening doors to more adults. “There are already tons of people who, once upon a time, by dint of age or circumstance, wouldn’t traditionally have gotten the chance to partake in education, but can now sign up for free online courses,” Mr. Yoquinto said. Participants can choose a class here and there, without strapping on a backpack and heading to campus or signing up for expensive degree programs. Virtual learning has become “the great equalizer,” said Gene O’Neill, the chief executive of the  , which provides continuing education for veterinarians around the world. “Because of virtual learning, veterinary professionals everywhere, even in remote, undeveloped countries, can learn from the world’s most renowned leaders and virtually participate in conferences,” he said. “This puts learning on an equal platform for everyone regardless of geography, income or time constraints.” Ms. Livingston’s goal was to improve her skills so she could become a paid teacher on the GetSetUp platform, which offers classes — all taught via Zoom by teachers older than 50 — on skills from professional development to technology, health, wellness and hobbies like photography. There’s even a new class about registering for a  , given the   There are three membership levels, starting at free and topping out at $20 a month for unlimited access. “The nature of work is changing,” said Neil Dsouza, GetSetUp’s chief executive and co-founder. “The traditional way of designing training and reskilling is a long, drawn-out program where you get a certificate or a degree. By the time you get that certificate, the skill is already outdated. We’re changing that model.” Ms. Livingston, who lives in York, Pa., signed up to learn how to use Zoom to host classes, how to manage and lead an online class and how to teach Google Classrooms. “Seniors everywhere were in lockdown and were eager to learn and connect,” she said. Because she’s interested in cooking and eating healthy meals, Ms. Livingston eventually began teaching classes such as “Great Dinners in 30 Minutes or Less,” “Healthy Eating on a Budget” and “Healthy Desserts That Are Delicious, Too.” In January, Oasis, a nonprofit educational organization, launched   with a menu of online classes on subjects from art to writing.  , a unit of  , or OATS, is a nonprofit resource for people 60 and older that offers courses and lectures. OATS was founded in 2004 in New York City as a community-based project for older adults focused on tech education. Since then, it has expanded to over 200 locations in five states, serving urban and rural communities. But last year it was forced to pivot in response to the pandemic. “We taught hundreds of in-person classes before the virus forced the closure of Senior Planet locations in March,” said Tom Kamber, the founder and executive director. That’s when his team pulled together and, within weeks, launched a fully digital   of courses and programs that have rapidly expanded its reach to its primary audience — a global community of anyone 60 and older. Beyond Senior Planet, OATS launched  , which aims to get one million older adults online. It provides tablets, along with training and technical support, to 10,000 older residents of New York City Housing Authority communities. “I really wanted to create a program that would be able to get older adults to use technology and give them the kinds of training and support in environments where they could succeed,” Mr. Kamber said. While older adults are continuing to learn new skills, they also are  . In 2019,  , a nonpartisan group supporting entrepreneurship, found that more than 25 percent of new entrepreneurs were ages 55 to 64, up from about 15 percent in 1996. Online courses are riding that start-up wave. GetSetUp, for example, offers courses on running an e-commerce marketplace, starting a business from home and building a website. Other offerings for entrepreneurs include  , a three-month virtual boot camp for entrepreneurs over 50, and the AARP Foundation’s , which offers free webinars and workshops. But all these online opportunities are not possible without access to the internet. “While there’s a rising passion for knowledge, people are getting excluded from the educational process in this country because they’re not online,” Mr. Kamber said. Based on a   OATS recently released in partnership with the Humana Foundation, nearly 22 million Americans over the age of 65 lack broadband access at home. “The good news, though, is the level of sophistication of online education is increasing and more access is coming to rural communities,” Mr. Kamber said. “It’s a brave new world of learning for people, and that gives me hope.” For Ms. Livingston, that means continuing to take and teach classes at GetSetUp. “Learning at any stage of life is what stimulates creativity and joy,” she said. “So much energy emerges from connecting the dots, having ‘aha’ moments and gaining skills. I love that I can help others keep their zest for life and help myself in the process.”"
An Accidental Disclosure Exposes a $1 Billion Tax Fight With Bristol Myers,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/business/bristol-myers-taxes-irs.html,"Almost nine years ago, Bristol Myers Squibb filed paperwork in Ireland to create a new offshore subsidiary. By moving Bristol Myers’s profits through the subsidiary, the American drugmaker could substantially reduce its U.S. tax bill. Years later, the Internal Revenue Service got wind of the arrangement, which it condemned as an “abusive” tax shelter. The move by Bristol Myers, the I.R.S. concluded, would cheat the United States out of about $1.4 billion in taxes. That is a lot of money, even for a large company like Bristol Myers. But the dispute remained secret. The company, which denies wrongdoing, didn’t tell its investors that the U.S. government was claiming more than $1 billion in unpaid taxes. The I.R.S. didn’t make any public filings about it. And then, ever so briefly last spring, the dispute became public. It was an accident, and almost no one noticed. The episode provided a fleeting glimpse into something that is common but rarely seen up close and that the Biden administration hopes to discourage: multinational companies, with the help of elite law and accounting firms and with only belated scrutiny from the I.R.S., dodging billions of dollars in taxes. Then, in an instant, all traces of the fight — and of Bristol Myers’s allegedly abusive arrangement — vanished from public view. Like most big pharmaceutical companies, Bristol Myers, which is based in New York, reduces its U.S. taxes by holding patent rights to its most lucrative drugs in subsidiaries in countries with low tax rates. The result is that the company’s profits move from high-tax places like the United States to places like Ireland, which has a low corporate tax rate and makes it easy for companies to attribute profits to locales with no income taxes at all. The $2 trillion   that the White House unveiled on Wednesday proposed increasing the minimum overseas tax on multinational corporations, which would reduce the appeal of such arrangements. For the three years leading up to 2012, Bristol Myers’s tax rate was about 24 percent. The U.S. corporate income tax rate at the time was 35 percent. (It is now 21 percent.) The company wanted to pay even less. In 2012, it turned to  , the accounting, consulting and advisory firm, and a major law firm,  , for help getting an elaborate tax-avoidance strategy off the ground. PwC had previously been Bristol Myers’s auditor, but it was dismissed in 2006 after   forced Bristol Myers   to the U.S. government. Now PwC, with a long   Irish tax shelters for multinational companies, returned to Bristol Myers’s good graces. The plan hinged on a tax write-off known as amortization. It lets companies deduct from their taxable income a portion of the cost of things, like the value of a patent, over a period of years. (For physical assets like office buildings, the process is known as depreciation.) In the United States, Bristol Myers held rights to patents on several drugs that it had already fully written off for tax purposes. In Ireland, a Bristol Myers subsidiary held rights to patents that it had not yet fully written off. That mismatch provided a lucrative opportunity. The company moved the patent rights from the U.S. and Irish subsidiaries into a new company. As the U.S. patents generated income, the Irish amortization deductions now helped offset U.S. taxes. When a company deploys a complicated new arrangement like this, it will generally seek the imprimatur of law and accounting firms. If they vouch for the maneuver’s legitimacy, that can protect the company from accusations that it deliberately broke the law. In fall 2012, after the new structure was set up, Bristol Myers asked PwC and White & Case to review the arrangement. Both firms provided the company with lengthy letters — each more than 100 pages — essentially signing off from a legal standpoint. “Bristol Myers Squibb is in compliance with all applicable tax rules and regulations,” said Megan Morin, a company spokeswoman. “We work with leading experts in this area and will continue to work cooperatively with the I.R.S. to resolve this matter.” A spokeswoman for PwC declined to comment. White & Case lawyers and a spokeswoman did not respond to a list of questions. But there were ample signs that the I.R.S. would probably take a dim view of the arrangement. A few months earlier, a federal appeals court had   after it challenged a similar maneuver by General Electric using an offshore subsidiary called Castle Harbour. The I.R.S. also contested comparable setups by   and  . The Bristol Myers arrangement “appears to be essentially a copycat shelter,” said Karen Burke, a tax law professor at the University of Florida. Since the I.R.S. was already fighting similar high-profile transactions, she said, “Bristol Myers’s behavior seems particularly aggressive and risky.” The next January,  . Its tax rate had plunged from nearly 25 percent in 2011 to negative 7 percent. On a call with investors, executives fielded repeated questions about the drop in its tax rate. “Presumably, all drug companies try to optimize their legal entities to take their tax rate as low as they can, yet your rate is markedly lower than any of the other companies,” said Tim Anderson, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “So I’m wondering why your tax rate might be unique in that regard?” Charlie Bancroft, the company’s chief financial officer, wouldn’t say. The more than $1 billion in tax savings came at an opportune moment: Bristol Myers was in the midst of repurchasing $6 billion worth of its own shares, an effort to lift its stock price. By January 2013, it had spent $4.2 billion. The cash freed up by the tax maneuver was enough to cover most of the remainder. It is not clear when I.R.S. agents first learned about the arrangement. But by last spring, the I.R.S. chief counsel’s office had determined that it violated a provision of the tax law that targets abusive profit-shifting arrangements. In a 20-page legal analysis, the I.R.S. calculated that the offshore setup was likely to save Bristol Myers up to $1.38 billion in federal taxes. After a complex audit, the I.R.S. often circulates its analyses to agents nationwide in case they encounter similar situations. A redacted version of the report is also made public on the I.R.S. website, cleansed of basic information like the name of the company. But when the I.R.S. posted its Bristol Myers report last April, it was not properly redacted. With tools available on most laptops, the redacted portions could be made visible. The I.R.S. quickly removed the improperly redacted version from its website. But  , a widely read trade publication, had also posted the document. When the I.R.S. provided a clean version, Tax Notes took down the original. An I.R.S. spokesman declined to comment. Cara Griffith, the chief executive of Tax Analysts, the publisher of Tax Notes, said the publication erred “on the side of not publishing confidential taxpayer information that was accidentally released through an error in redaction, unless it reaches a very high threshold of newsworthiness.” In the intervening hours, though, some tax practitioners had downloaded the original version from Tax Notes. One of them shared it with The New York Times, which viewed the document without the redactions. In addition to detailing the offshore structure, the I.R.S. report revealed the role of PwC and White & Case in reviewing the deal. While both firms assessed the arrangement’s compliance with various provisions of the tax law, neither firm offered an opinion on whether the deal violated the one portion of the tax law — an anti-abuse provision — that the I.R.S. later argued made the transaction invalid. Tax experts said they doubted the omission was inadvertent. The I.R.S. can impose penalties on companies that knowingly skirt the law. By not addressing the most problematic portion of the law, Bristol Myers’s advisers might have given the company plausible deniability. Both firms “appear to have carefully framed the issues so that they could write a clean opinion that potentially provided a penalty shield,” Professor Burke said. , a former Treasury Department official who helped write the regulations governing the tax-code provision that Bristol Myers is accused of violating, agreed. PwC and White & Case “are giving you 138 pages of legalese that doesn’t address the core issue in the transaction,” he said. “But you can show the I.R.S. you got this big fat opinion letter, so it must be fancy and good.” The current status of the tax dispute is not clear. Similar disputes have spent years winding through the I.R.S.’s appeals process before leading to settlements. Companies often agree to pay a small fraction of what the I.R.S. claims was owed. “There is a real chance that a matter like this could be settled for as little as 30 percent” of the amount in dispute, said Bryan Skarlatos, a tax lawyer at Kostelanetz & Fink. In that case, the allegedly abusive tax shelter would have saved Bristol Myers nearly $1 billion."
A Smarter App Is Watching Your Wallet,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/business/apps-personal-finance-budget.html,"They promise to nudge you into saving more, negotiate your bank fees, cover overdrafts and help you pay down your debt. They’ll even cheer you on when you spend wisely and remind you your bills are coming due. These are the newest evolution of personal financial management tools, with the emphasis on personal. Such money management software is not new;  , the granddaddy of the industry, started in the 1980s to make bill-paying and budgeting easier and evolved as the industry did. Two of the top apps,   and  , are more than 10 years old. But as artificial intelligence has become ever more sophisticated, these tools — and almost all of them are apps — have proliferated; it’s almost impossible to say how many there are, but new ones seem to be coming on the market almost daily. They are “more intuitive, more developed,” said Chanelle Bessette, a banking writer at  , a personal finance website that also offers its own budgeting   “These apps are getting to know their users a lot better — users are feeding them information about how they spend, and that helps the predictions become even better.” The apps are essentially looking to become almost as good as a live personal adviser, but one that you don’t pay much for and that can live in your pocket. Some charge a monthly or annual subscription; others are free and make money through referral fees they collect when a user buys the financial products or services promoted on the site. “Their mission before was to make it easier for consumers to budget, but now they’re really creating features that enable consumers to buy stocks, apply for loans and autosave all on one platform,” said Anisha Kothapa, a fintech analyst at CB Insights, which tracks business trends. Companies are trying to stand out in a crowded marketplace, and while some are bundling more features to attract users, others aim to specialize. Such apps are particularly popular for budgeting and setting goals; in this area, Mint,   and   often top “best of” lists. Like all these tools, they require a user’s credit card, banking and other financial information to track spending and income levels and then automatically sort them into categories. Each offers something a little different. Mint provides free credit score checks as often as you like (it’s a “soft” check, so it won’t hurt your credit score). You Need a Budget, also known as YNAB, relies on a system called zero-based budgeting, where every dollar is put into an account, such as holiday spending, emergency fund and so on, so that you end up with zero. “We really want people to be proactive, rather than reactive,” said Jesse Mecham, founder of YNAB. “People think that budgeting means they forecast what they’re going to make and what they’re going to spend; we teach people to budget only with the money you have on hand right now. We want people to change their behavior, and that comes with changing their thinking.” Other tools are more focused on automatic savings and investing; they have become increasingly creative and game like.   connects with a web-based service,   which allows users to set up rules for saving and investing. For example, the Qapital app can connect to your Fitbit so that every time you hit a goal (walking 10,000 steps) or fail to meet one (not sleeping enough), you put money toward one of your savings or investing goals. Or it can be unrelated to anything you do — just have it sock some money away when the temperature hits 75 degrees, when it rains or if you visit a favorite place. As natural language processing, a part of artificial intelligence, becomes more refined, some of these apps are creating a relationship with their users.  , an app focused on reducing debt, is a chatbot-based penguin who serves as a supportive friend. “Charlie celebrates your progress, no matter how small or big,” said Ilian Georgiev, Charlie’s co-founder and chief executive. “One thing we’ve heard over and over is that people want a judgment-free environment.” If you want something that actively helps reduce your costs, some companies have services that look for ways to lower your payments or lop off pesky fees.   is one of the better-known tools — a rare one that is website based, not an app — that, among other things, identifies recurring charges, such as subscriptions, to make sure you still want them. It can also negotiate with your internet, cable and phone company to lower your payments.  scans users’ connected credit card and bank statements (how often depends on the level of subscription you pay for), looking for overdrafts and extra fees, said Paul Kesserwani, the company’s founder and chief executive. Cushion then negotiates with the financial institutions, either through the secure bank portal (if the customer gives permission), through online chat on the bank’s website, or even through traditional mail if needed. “Bank and credit card terms of service are so complex that’s it’s often easy for people to accrue fees,” Mr. Kesserwani said. It took four years, he noted, to build up the data set and technology stack to accurately detect bank fees, figure out which ones to negotiate, determine how to approach each negotiation and then communicate with the bank automatically on the consumer’s behalf. The bells and whistles may be nice, but the benefit of these apps lies in forcing users to face how much they’re truly spending and where it ends up. “A budget is a fundamental step in financial literacy, and just tracking your spending versus your income is so illuminating,” Ms. Bessette said. Personal financial management tools can make it easier to budget, save and invest, but you do have to actually use them. According to a  , after one day, retention hovers around 23 percent and falls to just under 6 percent after one month. And while users can jump around and test various apps — and try a combination of them to cover specific needs — Ms. Bessette noted that there are benefits to staying with one app for years. “I’ve used Mint for about eight years, and it has all my historical data, which makes it much easier to see trends,” she said. Because users are giving away some of their most valued financial information, security and privacy are critical. Read the apps’ privacy policy — it’s best to look for a policy that promises it will never sell your information to a third party, said Paul Bischoff, editor of  , a tech research and comparison site with an emphasis on cybersecurity and consumer privacy. And although all the personal financial management companies will promise your data will be held in a virtual Fort Knox, “all apps are secure until they’re not,” Mr. Bischoff said. It’s not that these apps are in any greater danger of being hacked than, say, your bank or any other institution, but “the more people who have the information the greater the risk,” he said. “I wouldn’t just sign up for apps willy-nilly.”"
What’s Good for the Ocean May Also Be Good for Business,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/climate/ocean-blue-economy-business.html,"Marty Odlin, who grew up and lives on the Maine coast, remembers what the ocean used to be like. But now, he said, “It’s like a desert and just within my lifetime.” In the last few years, he said, he has seen lots of sea grass and many other species virtually disappear from the shoreline. Mr. Odlin, 39, comes from a fishing family and has a passion for the history of the ocean and the coast, both of which have informed his sense of the ocean’s decline, a small part of the catastrophic deletion of marine life over the last several hundred years. Using his training as an engineer, Mr. Odlin has decided to try to reverse that decline with his company,  , which is based in Portland. Using a combination of robotics, sensors and machine learning, he is building an aquaculture operation that is selling oysters now and eventually clams. He is also using that system to grow kelp, with the goal of producing enough of this seaweed to pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and permanently sequester it by burying it on the ocean floor, and sell carbon offsets. The company also plans to seed oyster reefs and clam beds along the shoreline, and restore kelp forests and sea grass, to help the coastal ecosystem by bringing back biodiversity and improving water quality, among other benefits. Mr. Odlin’s plans are one of a number of efforts in the “blue economy,” a term used to describe commercial activity on the oceans, seas and coasts. He and others are trying to prove that ocean conservation, sustainable fishing and carbon sequestration can be good for business, especially as global shipping, aquaculture and the appetite for wild seafood increases around the world. Mr. Odlin and his team build everything: boats, oyster floats, sensors and more, all with very high sensitivity to their environment. They measure the amount of feed in the water and the growth rate of the various species and send that information into a database that they use to make all sorts of decisions: whether to change the feed, reposition the shellfish floats or make bigger changes about the varieties they’re growing. They also use the hard-won knowledge of commercial fishermen — there are about a dozen on staff — which Mr. Odlin said was a huge advantage. The climate crisis demands technological innovations and “hard hats and steel toes,” he said. Dan Watson, the chief executive and co-founder of  , also has recognized the benefits of working alongside industry and demonstrating profitability. His company builds high-tech fishing nets for trawling boats: Attached to the nets are LED lights that flash in various patterns and levels of brightness to signal emergency escape hatches (right-size holes) for those species that fishing boats aren’t trying to catch, known collectively as bycatch.  that LED lights can   the amount of unwanted species that end up in fishing nets. , about 9.1 million tons, or just over 10 percent of all of the fish caught every year, are thrown away, with nearly half coming from trawling nets. In an era of overfishing and   that defy international regulations, reducing the amount of fish or other marine animals that are caught by mistake could have important consequences for the health of various populations as well as ocean biodiversity as a whole, Mr. Watson said. “When I started all of this, I was a student, and I had the attitude of, ‘This is going to save the world and everyone should do it,’” Mr. Watson said. “I had to turn more towards, ‘Here is the value proposition, and there is a strong financial argument for catching the right fish,’” he added. “We can show crews, ‘Here is what you save on fuel, here is what you save on regulatory fines.’” Others, too, see the value of working with industry groups.   is an initiative from the University of California Santa Barbara to help big ships avoid hitting whales as they travel through ports around Los Angeles. The program came, in part, as a response to shipping companies asking for help, according to Douglas McCauley, a professor of ocean science at U.C.S.B. Ship strikes, as they are known, are among the leading causes of death for whales, and 2018 and 2019 were the worst years on record for collisions on the West Coast, with 27 total resulting in 22 deaths, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Scientists estimate that the actual number of whales killed by ships could be much higher —  — because not all of the bodies are discovered. Dr. McCauley helped bring together ocean technologists working at U.C.S.B. to build a near real-time detection system for whales in the Santa Barbara Channel,  : an artificial intelligence algorithm that analyzes whale sounds, classifies them by species, and sends the data for review; a remote sensing system that predictively forecasts whale presence; and plain old citizen science, where trained whale watchers log whales into a mobile app. “It’s not helpful if you’re only able to say, ‘Southern California is forecast to be cloudy with a chance of blue whales,” and this model forecasts at a much finer scale, Dr. McCauley said. The system delivers the information to ships in a simplified rubric of low, medium, high and very high, so that they can slow if whales are around, which can  . Whale Safe provides data about only this particular stretch of the California coast, but Dr. McCauley said they were planning to expand to San Francisco and possibly elsewhere in North America. When ships reduce their speed they use less fuel, resulting in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants; the global shipping industry accounts for  . Cargo ships typically burn dirty fuel that releases pollutants like nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide, which can cause various cancers and childhood asthma for people living in port cities.  . In only six months, slower speeds in the Santa Barbara and San Francisco areas   from nitrous oxide by more than 530 tons and greenhouse gas emissions by 17,000 metric tons. But saving the whales could also have huge climate benefits, Dr. McCauley said. During their lives and when they die, whales help sequester enormous amounts of carbon dioxide in two ways. When alive, whales supply phytoplankton (which suck up carbon dioxide) with the nutrients they need to grow. When whales die, their bodies sink to the bottom of the ocean and over time become part of the marine sediment layer, where they can sequester the carbon dioxide they have accumulated during their life span, an average of   for a great whale species, keeping it out of the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years. Any of these projects require a more hands-on approach to saving the ocean and a more deliberate overlap of business and conservation, which have historically been at odds, said Mr. Odlin, the founder of Running Tide. “We have to take a more active role in solving the problem that we’re seeing,” he said. “And how do you take a more active role? The moral imperative is that you have to build something at the scale of the problem.” Otherwise, he said, “generations in front of us are not going to forgive us.” “We still have a chance right now, so I’m working as hard as I can.”"
,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/06/technology/cyber-hackers-usa.html,"If ever there was a sign the United States was losing control of information warfare, of its own warriors, it was the moment one of its own, a young American contractor, saw first lady Michelle Obama’s emails pop up on his screen. For months, David Evenden, a former National Security Agency analyst, questioned what he was doing in Abu Dhabi. He, like two dozen other N.S.A. analysts and contractors, had been lured to the United Arab Emirates by a boutique Beltway contractor with offers to double, even quadruple, their salaries and promises of a tax-free lifestyle in the Gulf’s luxury playground. The work would be the same as it had been at the agency, they were told, just on behalf of a close ally. It was all a natural extension of America’s War on Terror. Mr. Evenden started tracking terror cells in the Gulf. This was 2014, ISIS had just laid siege to Mosul and Tikrit and Mr. Evenden tracked its members as they switched out burner phones and messaging apps. The images they traded back and forth could be brutal, but this was his calling, Mr. Evenden told himself. A theology major, he’d set out to be a chaplain. He was a long way from that, but what better way to prove your faith, he thought, than hunting those who sought to murder good Christians. Soon, though, he was assigned to a new project: proving the Emiratis’ neighbor, Qatar, was funding the Muslim Brotherhood. The only way to do that, Mr. Evenden told his bosses, would be to hack Qatar. “Go for it,” they told him. No matter that Qatar was also an American ally or that, once inside its networks, his bosses showed no interest in ever getting out. Before long his team at the contractor, CyberPoint, was hacking Emirati enemies, real and perceived, all over the world: Soccer officials at FIFA, the monarchy’s Twitter critics, and especially Qatari royals. They wanted to know where they were flying, who they were meeting, what they were saying. This too was part of the mission, Mr. Evenden was told; it had all been cleared up high. In the War on Terror and the cyber arms market, you could rationalize just about anything. All the rationalizations were stripped away the day emails from the first lady of the United States popped up on his screen. In late 2015, Michelle Obama’s team was putting the finishing touches on a trip to the Middle East. Qatar’s Sheikha Moza bint Nasser had invited Mrs. Obama to speak at her annual education summit in Doha, where the first lady would promote her “Let Girls Learn” initiative. Mrs. Obama and her team were in constant communication with Sheika Moza. And every last email between the first lady, her royal highness, and their staff — every personal reflection, reservation, itinerary change and security detail — was beaming back to former N.S.A. analysts’ computers in Abu Dhabi. “That was the moment I said, ‘We shouldn’t be doing this,’ he told me. “We should not be targeting these people.” Mr. Evenden and his family were soon on a flight home. He and the few colleagues who joined him tipped off the F.B.I. (The agency does not comment on investigations, but interviews suggest its review of CyberPoint is ongoing.) To pre-empt any fallout, some employees   clean to Reuters. The hack of Sheika Moza’s emails with Mrs. Obama has never been reported. It wasn’t long after Mr. Evenden settled back in the states that he started fielding calls and LinkedIn messages from his old buddies at the N.S.A., still in the service, who had gotten a “really cool job offer” from Abu Dhabi and wanted his advice. By 2020, the calls had become a drumbeat. “Don’t go,” he pleaded. “This is not the work you think you will be doing.” You might think you’re a patriot now, he wanted to warn them, but one day soon you too could wake up and find you’re just another mercenary in a cyber arms race gone horribly wrong. Three decades ago, the United States spawned, then cornered, the market for hackers, their tradecraft, and their tools. But over the past decade, its lead has been slipping, and those same hacks have come boomeranging back on us. Yet no one in government has seriously paused to recalibrate the strategy. Not with Michelle Obama’s emails caught in an American contractor’s dragnet in 2015. And not today, with Russian hackers inside our government networks. We went from occasional wake-up calls to one continuous, blaring alarm — and got better and better at ignoring it all. Months after Mr. Evenden returned home, in 2016, the N.S.A.’s own hacking tools were hacked, by a still unknown assailant. Those tools were picked up first by North Korea, then Russia, in the most destructive cyberattack in history.  Over the next three years, Iran emerged from a digital backwater into one of the most prolific cyber armies in the world. China, after a brief pause, is back to pillaging America’s intellectual property. And, we are now unwinding a Russian attack on our software supply chain that compromised the State Department, the Justice Department, the Treasury, the Centers for Disease Control, the Department of Energy and its nuclear labs and the Department of Homeland Security, the very agency charged with keeping Americans safe. We know this not because of some heroic N.S.A. hack, or intelligence feat, but because the government was tipped off by a security company, FireEye, after it discovered the same Russian hackers in its own systems. The hubris of American exceptionalism — a myth of global superiority laid bare in America’s pandemic death toll — is what got us here. We thought we could outsmart our enemies. More hacking, more offense, not better defense, was our answer to an increasingly virtual world order, even as we made ourselves more vulnerable, hooking up water treatment facilities, railways, thermostats and insulin pumps to the web, at a rate of 127 new devices per second. At the N.S.A., whose dual mission is gathering intelligence around the world and defending American secrets, offense eclipsed defense long ago. For every hundred cyberwarriors working offense — searching and stockpiling holes in technology to exploit for espionage or battlefield preparations — there was often only one lonely analyst playing defense to close them shut. America remains the world’s most advanced cyber superpower, but the hard truth, the one intelligence officials do not want to discuss, is that it is also its most targeted and vulnerable. Few things in the cybersecurity industry have a worse reputation than alarmism. There is even an acronym for it: “FUD,” short for “fear, uncertainty, and doubt.” When Leon Panetta, then secretary of defense, warned of a coming “Cyber Pearl Harbor” in 2012, he was dismissed as stoking FUD. The Cyber Pearl Harbor analogy is, indeed, flawed: The U.S. government did not see the Japanese bombers coming, whereas it has seen the digital equivalent coming for decades. And the potential for a calamitous attack — a deadly explosion at a chemical plant set in motion by vulnerable software, for example — is a distraction from the predicament we are already in. Everything worth taking has already been intercepted: Our personal data, intellectual property, voter rolls, medical records, even our own cyberweaponry. At this very moment, we are getting hacked from so many sides that it has become virtually impossible to keep track, let alone inform the average American reader who is trying to grasp a largely invisible threat that lives in code, written in language that most of us will never fully understand. This threat often feels too distant to combat, but the solutions have been there for decades: Individuals just decided that access and convenience, and in governments’ case, the opportunities for espionage, were worth leaving windows open, when we would have all been better off slamming them shut. “The N.S.A.’s fatal flaw is that it came to believe it was smarter than everyone else,” Peter Neumann,  , told me. “In the race to exploit everything and anything we could, we painted ourselves into a dead end where there is no way out.” There’s a reason we believed the fallacy that offense could keep us safe: The offense was a bloody masterpiece. Starting in 2007, the United States, with Israel, pulled off an attack on Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility that destroyed roughly a fifth of Iran’s centrifuges. That attack, known as Stuxnet, spread using seven holes, known as “zero days,” in Microsoft and Siemens industrial software. (Only one had been previously disclosed, but never patched). Short term, Stuxnet was a resounding success. It set Iran’s nuclear ambitions back years and kept the Israelis from bombing Natanz and triggering World War III. In the long term, it showed allies and adversaries what they were missing and changed the digital world order. In the decade that followed, an arms race was born. N.S.A. analysts left the agency to start cyber arms factories, like Vulnerability Research Labs, in Virginia, which sold click-and-shoot tools to American agencies and our closest Five Eyes English-speaking allies. One contractor, Immunity Inc., founded by a former N.S.A. analyst, embarked on a slippier slope. First, employees say, Immunity trained consultants like Booz Allen, then defense contractor Raytheon, then the Dutch and the Norwegian governments. But soon the Turkish army came knocking. Companies like CyberPoint took it further, stationing themselves overseas, sharing the tools and tradecraft the U.A.E. would eventually turn on its own people. In Europe, purveyors of the Pentagon’s spyware, like Hacking Team, started trading those same tools to Russia, then Sudan, which used them to ruthless effect. As the market expanded outside the N.S.A.’s direct control, the agency’s focus stayed on offense. The N.S.A. knew the same vulnerabilities it was finding and exploiting elsewhere would, one day, blow back on Americans. Its answer to this dilemma was to boil American exceptionalism down to an acronym — NOBUS — which stands for “Nobody But Us.” If the agency found a vulnerability it believed only it could exploit, it hoarded it. This strategy was part of what Gen. Paul Nakasone, the current N.S.A. director — and George Washington and the Chinese strategist Sun Tzu before him — call “active defense.” In modern warfare, “active defense” amounts to hacking enemy networks. It’s mutually assured destruction for the digital age: We hacked into Russia’s troll networks and its grid as a show of force; Iran’s nuclear facilities, to take out its centrifuges; and Huawei’s source code, to penetrate its customers in Iran, Syria and North Korea, for espionage and to set up an early warning system for the N.S.A., in theory, to head off attacks before they hit. When we discovered openings in the systems that govern the digital universe, we didn’t automatically turn them over to manufacturers for patching. We kept them vulnerable in the event the F.B.I. needed to access a terrorist’s iPhone or Cyber Command had reason to drop a cyberweapon on Iran’s grid one day. There were big payoffs, to be sure, many the public will never know, but all one needs to do is look at the attacks of the past five years to see that “active defense” and NOBUS aren’t working that well. In a leaked N.S.A. memo in 2012, an analyst warned as much, “Hacking routers has been good business for us and our Five Eyes partners for some time, but it is becoming apparent that other nation states are honing their skillz and joining the scene.” Only when the N.S.A.’s tools were hacked in 2017, then used against us, could we see how broken the trade-off between offense and defense had become. The agency had held onto a critical vulnerability in Microsoft for more than five years, turning it over to Microsoft only after the N.S.A. was hacked. By then it was too late. Businesses, schools and hospitals had yet to patch the hole when North Korea used it to attack one month later, or even two months later, when Russia baked it into a cyberattack that decimated vaccine supplies at Merck, cost FedEx $400 million and prevented doctors from accessing patient records. All in, that incident costs victims an estimated $10 billion in damages. In the wake of those strikes, in 2017, Gen. Michael Hayden, the former director of the N.S.A., and one of its most vocal supporters, was unusually speechless. “I cannot defend an agency having powerful tools if it cannot protect the tools and keep them in its own hands,”  . To understand how we got here, facing one escalating attack after another, and how we might possibly claw our way out, it’s useful to look back at the Russian attack that put us on this offensive course. That year, 1983, workers at the American embassy in Moscow came to believe that everything they said and did was being captured by the Soviets. They suspected a mole, and had it not been for a tip from the French, who discovered a bug in their teleprinters, they might have never discovered the mole was in their machines. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan personally approved a classified project, code-named Gunman, to find and eradicate any Soviet bugs in embassy equipment. It took 100 days just to get every last piece of equipment back to Fort Meade and nearly 100 more days to uncover the most sophisticated exploit the agency had ever seen. Sitting in the back of an embassy typewriter was a tiny magnetometer, a device that measured the slightest disturbance in the earth’s magnetic field. It had been recording the mechanical energy from every last typewritten stroke and transmitting the results via radio to a nearby Soviet listening unit, hidden in the embassy’s chimney. By the time Gunman was complete, and more implants were discovered, it was clear that the Soviets had been siphoning American secrets from our typewriters for eight years. “That was our big wake up call,” James R. Gosler, the godfather of American cyberwar, told me. “Or we’d still be using those damn typewriters.” If any single technologist can be credited with spurring the United States to scramble, catch up, and take the lead as the world’s most advanced digital superpower, it is Mr. Gosler. When I asked nearly every one of the men who guided the N.S.A. and C.I.A. through the turn of the century to name the father of American cyber offense. None hesitated: “Jim Gosler.” In Mr. Gosler’s lexicon, there’s BG — Before Gunman — and AG. BG, “Americans were fundamentally clueless,” he told me. “We were in la-la land.” AG, we were hacking into anything with a digital pulse. Over his long career at Sandia national labs, the N.S.A., and later the C.I.A., Mr. Gosler made it his personal mission to draw the government’s attention to vulnerabilities in the microchips, code and software seeping into our lives. He does not discuss any of the classified programs he was privy to, but under his tenure, he helped create a taxonomy of adversaries that could exploit these vulnerabilities and led teams of American analysts and spies to make sure the United States was on top. But every calorie the United States expended on offense came at the cost of defense. And over the decades, this trade-off gnawed at Mr. Gosler. Finding Gunman in those typewriters had been a feat. Finding its equivalent in our fighter jets or even the average high-end car, which now has more than 100 million lines of code? Good luck. This, essentially, is the predicament the United States now faces as it hunts down every last vector and backdoor used in the recent SolarWinds attack, so dubbed because Russians used SolarWinds, a Texas company that sells network software to government agencies, grid operators and more than 400 of the Fortune 500, as a conduit. Occasionally we respond to attacks with indictments, sanctions or cyberattacks of our own. President Biden added $10 billion in cybersecurity funds to his Covid-19 recovery proposal and said Thursday that the United States was “launching an urgent initiative” on cybersecurity, to improve America’s “readiness and resilience in cyberspace.” But finding every Russian back door could take months, years even. And climbing out of our current mess will entail a grueling choice to stop leaving ourselves vulnerable. For individuals, this means making life less convenient. It’s not ignoring password prompts and software updates, turning on two-factor authentication, not clicking malicious links. For businesses, it requires testing code as engineers write it, not after it has made its way into consumer hands. It requires adding moats around the crown jewels: using hand-marked paper ballots, removing the controls that govern our nuclear plants, medical equipment and air traffic from anything else. For the government, perhaps, an easy place to start is setting clear rules that prevent the N.S.A.’s own, like Mr. Evenden’s former employer, from doing the dirty work for other governments where the rules that govern our own spycraft do not apply. And it’s long past time to shut all the doors and windows that should never have been left open. Jim Gosler worked for decades to keep Americans, and our secrets, safe, to make sure we never had to know just how close to a catastrophic cyberattack we could come. Now, as the country reckons with scenarios he long feared, he realizes the way forward is understanding just how unsafe we already are. Gunman didn’t impact the average American where they would feel it, but SolarWinds is getting pretty darn close,” Mr. Gosler told me recently. “It’s so pervasive. It’s one step from SolarWinds into the electrical grid. If the average American can’t feel that? What is it going to take?” Nicole Perlroth, a cybersecurity reporter at The Times, is the author of the forthcoming book “ ,” from which this article is adapted."
,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/business/brooks-brothers-retail-bankruptcy.html,"ENFIELD, Conn. — The bones of Brooks Brothers stores are scattered across 100,000 square feet here in a warehouse near the Massachusetts border, mixed in with a sea of cardboard boxes and junk. There are legions of mannequins, empty circular tables that once displayed neckties, posters of horseback-riding gentlemen from a bygone era. There is a whole section of Christmas trees and countless gold-painted ornaments of sheep suspended by ribbon — a   since 1850 known as the Golden Fleece. Blank order forms for tailors are strewn about. A neon sign that apparently still works. There is no apparel, but there are rows of heavy sewing machines that most likely came from one of the brand’s recently shuttered factories. And in the bathroom, a welcome carpet with Brooks Brothers written in cursive sits next to a toilet. The whole mass was abandoned here in the fallout of Brooks Brothers’ bankruptcy filing and sale last year, the scraps of a retailer that made nearly $1 billion in sales in 2019. Ever since, the couple that owns the warehouse, Chip and Rosanna LaBonte, has been scrambling to figure out how to get rid of it all. Junk removal companies have told them it will cost at least $240,000 to clear the space, which Brooks Brothers had rented through November. In order to pay the bill, the LaBontes are going to have to sell their home. The couple’s plight illustrates the far-reaching consequences of  , which cascaded during the pandemic and affected everyone from factory workers to executives. Smaller vendors and landlords have often been left holding the  during lengthy byzantine bankruptcy proceedings, particularly with limits on what they can spend on legal bills compared with larger corporations. And once bankrupt brands are sold, people like the LaBontes are typically left in the dust. “It is a very sad situation that unfortunately does happen quite a bit because it is just part of the bankruptcy situation as the statute is drafted,” said James Van Horn, partner and retail bankruptcy specialist at Barnes & Thornburg. “Unfortunately, creditors can become victims, and sometimes they have little or no options to recover what is owed them.” Retailers like Brooks Brothers were prominent among the more than 600   in the United States last year, which had the highest number of filings in a decade, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The LaBontes, who are in their 60s, have been working with a liquidator to sell what they can of the Brooks Brothers detritus, and are about to list their home in Sherborn, Mass. While they have filed a claim in bankruptcy court, they are anticipating receiving less than 5 percent of what they are owed, if that — and confessed that the proceedings are hopelessly confusing. Most of all, they are angry and incredulous about the situation, especially as Brooks Brothers continues to operate under wealthy new owners. “We understand going out of business and the bankruptcy, but to dump their problem on us and walk away from it and make us incur this cleanup cost?” Mr. LaBonte said in an interview in Enfield. “Nobody would anticipate an expense like this — we don’t have rainy day money to deal with it.” The couple bought the warehouse in 2010. They said that it was their first foray into commercial real estate and that they worked on residential projects before that. They have other tenants and a self-storage section, but are frustrated about the mess and the fact they can’t use the space for anything else until it is cleared. Brooks Brothers, which was founded in 1818 and is the oldest continuously operated apparel brand in the United States, began renting the warehouse in Enfield in 2011, most recently at a rate of roughly $20,000 a month. (Brooks Brothers also has a corporate office and distribution center in Enfield.) The building, which spans about 375,000 square feet, is held by the LaBontes through KBRC Realty. It’s the firm’s sole holding and the couple’s main source of income. The office attire segment of retailing as a whole was battered last year as many Americans worked remotely, ditching  . J. Crew and the owners of Ann Taylor and Men’s Wearhouse also filed for bankruptcy, while sales nose-dived at chains like Banana Republic. Temporary store closures added to the distress, along with the cancellations of special occasions like proms, graduations, weddings and other events. All that led up to Brooks Brothers’   one of the most significant retail collapses of 2020. Brooks Brothers had dressed all but four U.S. presidents at the time of its filing, and prided itself on its American factories, which were also forced to close. But investors saw value in the brand, and the retailer was quickly purchased for $325 million by Simon Property Group, the biggest U.S. mall operator, and Authentic Brands Group, a licensing firm. The firms have been buying up a string of bankrupt mall retailers through a joint venture called , including Lucky Brand denim and Forever 21, leveraging the combination of Authentic Brands’ expertise in licensing famous brand names in various lucrative and creative (and some say equity-destructive) ways and Simon’s real estate portfolio. At the time of the Brooks Brothers purchase, SPARC committed to keep operating at least 125 Brooks Brothers retail locations, compared with 424 retail and outlet stores globally before the pandemic. Under the new owners, Brooks Brothers switched to wire transfers instead of checks, but kept paying rent on the warehouse through November, sending even more goods there as it closed dozens of stores and shuttered its , Mr. and Ms. LaBonte said. But after Thanksgiving, it sent a letter to the couple rejecting the lease as well as the contents of the warehouse. According to a person with knowledge of the deal, the warehouse and its contents had not been part of SPARC’s purchase of Brooks Brothers. As a result, said Mr. Van Horn said, the new owner most likely has no legal responsibility to the LaBontes. A representative for SPARC stopped returning requests for comment. “They used it for all of their store fixtures, so tables, props, fishing poles, canoes, everything you would see that would go in and out of a store to decorate it,” Mr. LaBonte said. “There’s probably 20,000 square feet of Christmas trees — everything except the actual merchandise.” As to who would want it now: Customers have included local clothing makers looking for mannequins and a set designer from an upcoming HBO series called “The Gilded Age.” Last Monday, an older couple wandered through the space, looking at the Christmas decorations and empty gift boxes. Habitat for Humanity has been looking at the haul for several days and is taking some of the goods. Still, Mr. LaBonte estimated that somewhere around 30 percent of the leftovers have been sold. The liquidator paid the LaBontes approximately $20,000 to sell what they can through mid-April or so. The couple will not receive a cut, and will deal with what’s left. When junk removal specialists assessed the cost of clearing the space in December, one quote was around $243,000 while the other was closer to $290,000. “We’re just another Covid casualty to them, we get that,” Ms. LaBonte said of Brooks Brothers. “But I also don’t think they realized how much stuff was there.” The junk removal firms, which confirmed the prices with The New York Times, said that it was expensive to remove the volume of goods. The costs included labor, multiple trips to dumps, donation and recycling centers, and the use of specialized equipment such as a forklift, large dumpsters and an 18-foot box truck. “I’ve been doing this for seven years and I’ve never seen anything like this before,” said Rick McDonald Jr., the owner of EastSide Junk, which provided the $243,000 quote to the couple. “They left an astronomical amount of stuff.” When Authentic Brands, the licensing firm, announced the purchase of Brooks Brothers out of bankruptcy last year, Jamie Salter, the company’s chief executive, spoke about the retailer’s legacy and its “incredible history.” The LaBontes, confronting a warehouse full of some of that history, were unhappy to see those comments. They put out a statement recently asking: “What kind of heritage can they claim when they operate like low-rent, fly-by-night bullies?” Contact Sapna Maheshwari at sapna@nytimes.com or Vanessa Friedman at vanessa.friedman@nytimes.com."
"Maggots, Rape and Yet Five Stars: How U.S. Ratings of Nursing Homes Mislead the Public",business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/business/nursing-homes-ratings-medicare-covid.html,"Twelve years ago, the U.S. government introduced a powerful new tool to help people make a wrenching decision: which nursing home to choose for loved ones at their most vulnerable. Using a simple star rating — one being the worst, five the best — the system promised to distill reams of information and transform an emotional process into one based on objective, government-blessed metrics. The star system quickly became ubiquitous, a popular way for consumers to educate themselves and for nursing homes to attract new customers. During the coronavirus pandemic, with many locked-down homes unavailable for prospective residents or their families to see firsthand, the ratings seemed indispensable. But a New York Times investigation, based on the most comprehensive analysis of the data that powers the ratings program, found that it is broken. Despite  , the system provided a badly distorted picture of the quality of care at the nation’s nursing homes. Many relied on sleight-of-hand maneuvers to improve their ratings and hide shortcomings that contributed to the damage when the pandemic struck. More than   nursing-home residents have died of Covid-19, and The Times’s analysis found that people at five-star facilities were roughly as likely to die of the disease as those at one-star homes. The ratings program, run by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, relies on a mix of self-reported data from more than 15,000 nursing homes and on-site examinations by state health inspectors. Nursing homes receive scores based on how they fare in those inspections; how much time nurses spend with residents; and the quality of care that residents receive. Those three grades are then combined into an overarching star rating for each nursing home. To evaluate the ratings’ reliability, The Times built a database to analyze millions of payroll records to determine how much hands-on care nursing homes provide residents, combed through 373,000 reports by state inspectors and examined financial statements submitted to the government by more than 10,000 nursing homes. The Times obtained access to portions of the ratings data that aren’t publicly available from academics who had research agreements with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or C.M.S. Among The Times’s findings: At homes whose five stars masked serious problems, residents developed bed sores so severe that their bones were exposed. Others lost the ability to move. But the most important impact may be that the nursing home industry was ill equipped for the pandemic. The rating system allowed facilities to score high grades without upgrading the care they provided. “They were working to improve their ratings, but not their quality,” said Charlene Harrington, who sits on a board that advises C.M.S. on the ratings system. “The problems with the five-star system left these homes less prepared in the pandemic,” she said. “They were allowed to not have enough staffing, and they were allowed to ignore infection-control deficiencies, so they had poorer quality than the public knew about, and they were in the worst position to manage Covid.” Fulton Commons Care, a nursing home on Long Island, is among hundreds of facilities whose five stars reflected self-reported data that was at times inaccurate. One of the home’s residents was Stasia Kochanowska, a 75-year-old retired nurse. Last March, her son, John Costa, got a phone call from Fulton Commons: She was being moved from a private room into one with other residents. Mr. Costa interpreted that as evidence that the home was short-staffed or overcrowded. “I thought that the idea was to isolate people to keep them safe from the virus,” he said. Not long after, he got another call: Ms. Kochanowska had a fever. On the morning of April 10, Mr. Costa got the news he had been dreading: His mother had died from Covid-19. “Looking back now, I realize that the star doesn’t work and shouldn’t be trusted,” Mr. Costa said. “But it’s too late.” The star system was introduced in 2008.   were buying many nursing homes, and lawmakers worried that the quality of care would deteriorate. (Today, for-profit companies own about 70 percent of all U.S. nursing homes.) The only way to evaluate nursing homes at the time was   called Nursing Home Compare. It included tables of statistics about each nursing home. Consumers largely ignored the information. The new system transformed hard-to-digest information on resident safety, staffing and dozens of other metrics into simple star ratings. The rating starts with the grade from the in-person inspections and then awards bonus points for facilities that score well on the other two ratings: for staffing and their quality of care. The staffing score reflects the number of hours that employees spend with patients. The quality-of-care rating incorporates 15 metrics — such as residents’ wounds and medications — drawn from what are essentially medical report cards for every resident. C.M.S. posts each nursing home’s overall star rating, and its ratings for inspections, staffing and quality of care, on a website called  When the system was first rolled out, elder-care groups applauded it for providing an easy-to-understand look inside nursing homes. As it gained popularity, it became a powerful determinant of fortunes in an industry with thin profit margins. Five-star facilities earned about $2,000 in profits per bed in 2019, according to a Times analysis of nursing homes’ financial statements. Those with three or four stars earned about $1,000 per bed. Poorly rated homes were typically not profitable. But within months of the star system’s launch, members of a Medicare advisory board cautioned federal officials that nursing homes were incentivized to fudge their numbers, according to board members and former regulators. Board members, including Ms. Harrington, a professor emeritus at the nursing school of University of California, San Francisco, called for more auditing of the self-reported data. Audits, however, remain rare, according to 25 former government officials, congressional aides, nursing home executives and elder-care advocates who meet regularly with C.M.S. officials. The Times found that from 2017 to 2019 health inspectors wrote up about 5,700 nursing homes, more than one out of every three in the country, for misreporting data about residents’ well-being. That included nearly 800 homes with top ratings. Some facilities didn’t tell the government about certain medications they were giving residents. Others didn’t disclose when residents took serious falls or developed bed sores. Even when inspectors discovered such misreporting, they didn’t conduct more detailed audits of all of the data that the homes submitted to C.M.S. A spokeswoman for C.M.S. said in a statement that the star-rating system is “intended to serve as one tool” for people to choose nursing homes. “Overall scores should be considered in light of a potential resident’s unique care needs,” she said. (C.M.S. would not identify the spokeswoman.) C.M.S. in recent years “has made multiple substantial improvements to both the ratings methodology and data reliability of the five-star quality rating system. These improvements have made it more difficult to attain or maintain higher ratings, driving providers to continue improving the quality of care they provide,” the spokeswoman said. She said the Department of Health and Human Services “takes reports of fraud seriously” and that “C.M.S. deploys enforcement and accountability measures swiftly if fraud is detected.” The warnings about self-reported data have been borne out by researchers. A   last year by Integra Med Analytics, a data firm started by a University of Texas professor, compared hospital admissions data with the information nursing homes submitted to Medicare. The paper concluded that half of nursing homes underreported potentially deadly pressure ulcers, or bed sores, by at least 50 percent. In 2019, the   found that nursing homes reported only 16 percent of incidents where residents were hospitalized for “potential abuse and neglect.” And researchers at the University of Chicago  , from 2011 to 2015, nursing homes didn’t tell Medicare about 40 percent of residents who were hospitalized after serious falls. One of the worst offenders in that study was the Clove Lakes home on Staten Island in New York, where 72 residents were admitted to a hospital after falling, but only 15 were reported to C.M.S. A Clove Lakes spokeswoman declined to comment. Menorah Park, a facility in Beachwood, Ohio, that had five stars, disclosed only 11 of 47 serious falls. Kathleen DeVito, a former resident at Menorah Park, said in an interview that she selected the facility based on its perfect rating. One night, she said, aides took her to the bathroom and then left her alone. She crashed to the floor while trying to wipe herself. Her ankle was shattered, her medical records show. She now has to use a walker. “I think about how much better I’d be if I had never gone there,” said Ms. DeVito, 78, a retired paralegal. Beth Silver, a spokeswoman for the nursing home, said, “The incidence of falls at Menorah Park is in line with other highly regarded facilities at both the state and federal levels, and are even lower for serious falls, which we attribute to our rigorous fall prevention program.” She added, “While our sympathy goes out to anyone who may have been injured while a resident at our facility, it does not necessarily mean that the facility was at fault or could have prevented the injury.” In 2018, C.M.S. improved the way it collected staffing data. Instead of asking nursing homes to report the average number of hours nurses and aides spent with residents, the agency required homes to submit payroll records that logged their daily hours. The hope was that such data would be harder to manipulate. With the payroll records, nursing homes’ average staffing numbers plummeted, according to the Times analysis. That suggested that homes had previously been inflating their nursing data. Even with the new system, many homes still appear to exaggerate how much time nurses spend with patients. The Times analyzed the publicly available staffing logs submitted to C.M.S. Thousands of homes — including more than 450 with four or five stars for staffing — derived at least half of their nursing hours from administrators who don’t care for patients. C.M.S. permits the practice, but the public sees only the total number of hours, not the breakdown between administrative nurses and registered nurses who care for patients. Sun Terrace Healthcare Center had a two-star rating for staffing in early 2019. Then, in the second half of the year, the home, in Sun City Center, Fla., reported a surge in its nursing hours. The bulk of that increase was from the addition of administrators to the tally. By January 2020, Sun Terrace had a five-star rating. “The administrative nursing staff at Sun Terrace work very closely with the direct care staff in a collaborative team approach to ensure the facility provides the best possible care for each and every resident,” said Alexander J. Kusmierz, the facility’s executive director. In light of questions from The Times, Mr. Kusmierz said, the home would audit the staffing data it has reported to C.M.S. “Sun Terrace will continue to make certain that the information provided is thorough and accurate,” he said. Researchers have   that the better staffed a facility was, the fewer residents they lost to Covid-19. More employees meant that patients received better care and were more closely monitored. When the pandemic hit, staffing came under additional strain as nurses and workers fell ill. Trinity Homes, a facility with 230 beds in Minot, N.D., received five stars for its staffing levels. But residents repeatedly complained to inspectors that the place was short-staffed. In 2019, half of Trinity’s nursing hours came from administrators. More than 130 residents contracted Covid-19. Thirty-five died. Karim Tripodina, a spokeswoman for Trinity, said the home complies with C.M.S. requirements and has “ample staff to care for our residents.” She said that Covid-19 spread inside the facility at the same time it was spreading in the local community, “despite aggressive efforts to maintain a safe environment.” Carrie Johnson, 75, had just had spinal fusion surgery. A raw incision snaked up her back, and it needed to be cleaned regularly to prevent infection. She couldn’t control her bowels. Using the C.M.S. website, Ms. Johnson found a nursing home, Brookdale Richmond Place, where she could recuperate. Part of the country’s largest chain of senior living communities, it was a short drive from her house in Lexington, Ky., and the only local facility with a five-star rating for staffing. “We thought it meant that I’d be safe,” Ms. Johnson said. That was not what it meant. At the time, in October 2017, Brookdale was operating with a skeleton crew, according to six current and former employees and court documents filed in a lawsuit brought by Ms. Johnson. Overwhelmed employees at the 120-bed facility would wake some residents as early as 3:30 a.m. to get them dressed for breakfast and then would put the residents back into bed to wait the hours until mealtime, the lawsuit alleged. More than a week passed before Ms. Johnson was first given a shower, her medical records show. Her surgical wound was not treated. No one came when she rang her call bell for help going to the toilet, so she sat for hours in her own urine and feces. At one point, Ms. Johnson said, a passing maintenance man changed her diaper. On at least three days in her first month there, no one brought her pain medication. Some days there were no nurses on the floor tending to patients, according to the current and former employees and depositions in the pending lawsuit. Nurses spent an average of less than 30 minutes a day per patient. Brookdale, however, told Medicare that each resident received an average of 75 minutes of daily care. The home arrived at that number by including nurses who were stationed at Brookdale’s corporate headquarters in Tennessee, some 200 miles away, according to depositions and the employees. Absent the inflated staffing numbers, Brookdale’s rating would most likely have fallen to one or two stars. Jessica Crutchfield, a nursing assistant who worked at the Brookdale home while Ms. Johnson was there, said in a deposition last year that her supervisors told her to falsify residents’ medical records to make it look like they received more care than they did. When she refused, she was fired, she said. Heather Hunter, a spokeswoman for Brookdale, said, “We have detailed policies in place to ensure compliance with C.M.S. reporting rules, and we are not aware of any instance where inaccurate or false information was submitted by any of our communities outside of the confines of the C.M.S. rules.” Ms. Johnson’s incision began to fester. In November 2017, a physical therapist noticed that it “appeared open and presented with discoloration around incisions.” She alerted the nursing staff, records show, but it took six days before anyone treated the wound. When Ms. Johnson went to an outside doctor, her wound was infected, medical records show. The doctor sent her to the hospital. The infection left her unable to move. Her muscles atrophied. Ms. Hunter didn’t comment on what happened to Ms. Johnson. “While The New York Times has the right to print unproven allegations from one side of a lawsuit seeking monetary damages, we choose not to litigate unsubstantiated facts in the press,” she said. Ms. Johnson now lives at home. She used to manage the kitchen at a local homeless shelter; now she can’t walk or even stand. She said she spends about six hours a day in front of the television, waiting for her husband to get back from work. She misses cooking sloppy joes for her six grandchildren. “I wouldn’t send my dog there,” Ms. Johnson said of Brookdale. “That five-star rating is garbage.” Medicare began tracking nursing homes’ use of certain prescription drugs after the Health and Human Services inspector general   that facilities were overusing antipsychotic drugs, which can be especially dangerous for older people. The ratings system now penalizes homes that overmedicate residents. According to court documents and interviews with nurses, administrators and government officials, nursing homes for years have underreported the number of residents on opiates and antipsychotics. On Dec. 12, 2017, Eunice Hill checked into National Healthcare Corporation’s nursing home in Greenville, S.C., for what was supposed to be a short-term rehab stay after a nasty fall made it hard for her to walk. (National Healthcare, a publicly traded company, operates 75 facilities around the United States.) Ms. Hill’s daughter, Anne Brown, said she and her mother drew comfort from the facility’s five-star rating. That first day at the nursing home, staff gave Ms. Hill Haldol, a powerful antipsychotic, her medical records show. She was also given anti-anxiety medications every day for a week. That is not what National Healthcare told the government. At least four times a year, nursing homes are required to provide C.M.S. “minimum data sets” for each patient, the equivalent of medical report cards that detail things like weight, medications and wounds. In Ms. Hill’s data set, National Healthcare said that she did not receive any antipsychotics and only got anti-anxiety drugs once. A National Healthcare spokeswoman declined to comment, citing a pending lawsuit that Ms. Hill’s daughter filed against the company. Ms. Hill, 93 and suffering from diabetes, started skipping meals, causing her blood sugar levels to go wild, according to her medical records. In late December, she was rushed to a hospital. Doctors found her kidneys were failing and that she was severely dehydrated. She died on Jan. 3, less than a month after she arrived at the National Healthcare home. At the Good Samaritan home in Albert Lea, Minn., a resident’s foot became infested with   in 2018 after her bandages were left on for days. At Dwelling Place in Dover, N.J., staff didn’t change residents’   for more than a month last year, increasing the risk of infection. In both cases, government health inspectors determined that the nursing homes failed to keep their residents safe. Yet both earned five stars. The C.M.S. rating system puts the greatest weight on in-person inspections; they are the starting point for the final star rating. But the exams do little to penalize homes with serious problems. At nearly 1,200 homes with five stars, inspectors over a three-year period identified at least one problem involving potential patient abuse, such as violence committed by staff or the failure to investigate injuries, The Times found. In 2019, health inspectors   a nursing assistant at the Reo Vista home in San Diego had followed a resident who uses a wheelchair to her room from the kitchen, where she was getting a late-night sandwich. The employee pushed her on the bed and raped her, according to the inspection report. The report classified the attack as a “category F” violation, a low-level problem that caused potential, not actual, harm. That designation helped Reo Vista hold onto its perfect rating, which it trumpets on its website. “This former staff member’s actions do not reflect the values we hold at our facility that our overall five-star rating more accurately reflects,” said William Fredricksen, Reo Vista’s administrator. He said the home was using background checks and other means “to ensure that something like this never again occurs at our facility.” At 40 other five-star nursing homes, inspectors similarly determined that sexual abuse did not constitute actual harm or put residents in “immediate jeopardy,” The Times found. After a complaint in 2019, for example, inspectors   that a nursing assistant at Hickory Creek in Madison, Ind., had barged into the bathroom while a resident was showering and groped her breasts. Hickory Creek kept its five stars. Hickory Creek officials didn’t respond to requests for comment. At Manor Care in Boca Raton, Fla., John Schulz, a 57-year-old resident with Alzheimer’s, was strangled to death by another resident in 2019. The state coroner ruled it a homicide. The death doesn’t appear in inspection records at all. The facility has a five-star rating. “The unfortunate incident was very isolated,” said Julie Beckert, a spokeswoman. She said staff responded “quickly and appropriately” to the strangulation. In theory, health inspections can occur at any time, without notice. But The Times found that in 2019 about 70 percent of nursing homes increased their staff on the days that inspectors visited, compared with their typical staffing levels on that day of the week. On average, the homes added 25 hours of staff time — a roughly 8 percent increase — to their rosters on the day of the inspection. For more than 800 facilities, inspection day was the best-staffed day of the year. The odds of that happening randomly are virtually zero, suggesting that many homes are able to anticipate their inspection dates. When inspectors visited Mitchell-Hollingsworth Nursing & Rehabilitation Center in Florence, Ala., on a Thursday in September 2019, the home recorded its highest level of staffing all year: 785 total hours worked by nurses and aides, 15 percent higher than other Thursdays that year. “We have absolutely no indication of when the inspectors are coming,” said Brian Scheri, the home’s administrator. In some cases, corruption was to blame. In 2017, a state health inspector in Florida   to accepting $500,000 in bribes for telling homes about future inspections. Fifteen years earlier, the head of Oklahoma’s health department pleaded guilty to similar charges. Nursing home staff and state-funded watchdogs said in interviews that hundreds of homes seemed to know in advance about the timing of inspections. “Every home seemed to get a tip and would roll out the red carpet,” said Tony Cisney, a former inspector responsible for visiting about a dozen homes in Kentucky. The coronavirus hit America’s nursing homes harder than any other part of the country. Nearly one out of every 10 nursing home residents died from Covid-19. The pandemic laid bare the flaws in the government rating system. The state health inspections do little to penalize homes with poor records of preventing and controlling infections. From 2017 to 2019, The Times found, inspectors cited nearly 60 percent — more than 2,000 — of the country’s five-star facilities at least once for not following basic safety precautions, like regular hand washing. Yet they earned top ratings. In San Bernardino, Calif., inspectors wrote up Del Rosa Villa for four different infection-control violations. It kept its five stars. Ninety residents at the 104-bed facility have contracted the coronavirus, and 13 have died. Del Rosa Villa officials didn’t respond to requests for comment. Life Care Centers of Kirkland, Wash., the first nursing home in the United States to have documented coronavirus cases, was found in 2019 to have weak infection controls, despite its five stars. State inspectors wrote it up for failing to “consistently implement an effective infection control program.” Thirty-nine of the facility’s   have died from Covid-19. The home has 190 beds. Leigh Atherton, a Life Care spokeswoman, said that citation was the only lapse in infection control that inspectors had identified over 32 previous visits. She said the home quickly fixed the problem. If the rating system worked as intended, it would have offered clues as to which homes were most likely to have out-of-control outbreaks and which homes would probably muddle through. That is not what happened. The Times found that there was little if any correlation between star ratings and how homes fared during the pandemic. At five-star facilities, the death rate from Covid-19 was only half a percentage point lower than at facilities that received lower ratings. And the death rate was slightly lower at two-star facilities than at four-star homes. A facility’s location, the infection rate of the surrounding community and the race of nursing home residents   of whether a nursing home would suffer an outbreak. The star ratings didn’t matter. That is consistent with academic research.   found little relationship between a facility’s star rating and its Covid-19 infection and death rates. At Fulton Commons Care in East Meadow, N.Y., its five stars largely stemmed from its self-reported data, which researchers have found at times to be incorrect. The home reported only 11 instances of residents taking serious falls between 2011 and 2015. The University of Chicago researchers, however, identified 40 falls for which residents were hospitalized. Similarly, Integra Med Analytics found that, at most, Fulton Commons was reporting to C.M.S. one-third of its residents’ pressure ulcers. The research firm   the home deserved one star, not five. Fulton Commons officials did not respond to requests for comment. Fulton Commons stopped allowing visitors last March. Automated phone calls assured family members that the virus hadn’t infiltrated the home. Stasia Kochanowska died from Covid-19 on April 10. That same day, another resident, 88-year-old Adele Guyear, spoke to her daughter, Pamela Martin. Usually bubbly, Ms. Guyear now sounded terrified. She said her roommate had died from the virus. So had two women down the hall. And, Ms. Guyear told her daughter, she had a bad cough. Ms. Martin initially had been comforted by the home’s five-star rating. But during the pandemic she had struggled to get her phone calls returned. Now, hearing from her mother, Ms. Martin began to panic. She said she called the home and demanded that Ms. Guyear be sent to a hospital. There, she tested positive for Covid-19. Her mother survived, but she can’t breathe without supplemental oxygen, Ms. Martin said. On May 15, health inspectors cited Fulton Commons for having a deficient program for preventing and controlling infections. C.M.S.   the problem as causing “minimal harm or the potential for actual harm.” The facility kept its five stars. Forty-one Fulton Commons residents have died from Covid-19. “Knowing what I know now,” Ms. Martin said, “you’d have to be crazy to give this place a five-star rating.” The Times’s analysis of the star system’s effectiveness was based in large part on data submitted to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or C.M.S. The Times used data from  , before the pandemic upended the industry and temporarily changed data-collection practices. The primary analysis examined the characteristics of homes with five-star ratings, including their staffing patterns and code violations. The core data set was from the Nursing Home Compare system. That included the most recent set of star ratings for each facility and the underlying metrics. To see how these ratings changed over time, The Times also examined   and metrics going back to 2015. The Times looked at all code violations reported in the three inspection cycles included in the January 2020 data. The analysis also incorporated nursing homes’ 2019   (daily logs of the hours worked by nurses, aides and administrators) and   (financial statements that facilities submit to the government). The cost reports were used to examine the relationship between profitability and the star system. In addition, The Times used summary data provided by researchers who were granted access to individualized data on Medicare claims. By examining how often nursing home residents were admitted to hospitals   or complications from  , the researchers demonstrated the extent to which facilities underreported serious health incidents in data they submit for ratings purposes.

An Argument for Investing Where the Return Is Social Change,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/your-money/impact-investing-social-change.html,"Advocates for impact investments have long made the case that investments can do social good without sacrificing returns. And then there are the wealthy philanthropists who give money to nonprofit organizations trying to bring about social change without expecting any financial return. But there is a middle ground for investors — a little more impact for a little less return. It has been the third rail of socially responsible investing, though, mainly because impact investors fear that such an approach could embolden critics who have long warned that investors will get lower returns if they want to push for change. Now, a new study by the Bridgespan Group, a nonprofit philanthropic consultant, argues that this is the moment to put more money, time and energy into a middle ground, which it calls impact-first investing. The  , “Back to the Frontier: Investing That Puts Impact First,” focuses on investments that consider positive impact first and financial return second. It makes the case for how such investments can boost emerging technologies faster than grants or traditional impact investments. These investments, the report says, can help create new markets. “It doesn’t have to be just return-seeking or just philanthropy,” said Michael Etzel, co-head of the impact investing practice at Bridgespan and the lead author of the report. “You can use that tool that sits in the middle.” Mr. Etzel said he saw this approach as a way to speed up getting to a solution by backing new technologies or creating markets that could later support more traditional impact investments. “Success is about the social and environmental impact you care about and getting to it faster rather than looking at your overall portfolio and net worth,.” he said. One example of how this would work is the investment strategy of Ceniarth, which is focusing on using its funds to bring about major changes. Ceniarth, with $450 million, was set up by Diane Isenberg, whose wealth derives from Nabors Industries, the oil and gas drilling company created by her father, Eugene. Its impact-first investments are considered high risk without the commensurate rate of return for the risk being taken, though they are still likely to pay back something. “Our segment is working on livelihoods in marginalized and vulnerable communities globally,” said Greg Neichin, the director of Ceniarth. “We’re trying to improve economic livelihoods by addressing issues of poverty around the world.” One investment it made was in the One Acre Fund, which provides loans so small farmers in Africa can buy better seed and fertilizer and get agronomic training. “When we think about the things for us that are successful, it’s a combination of delivering economic benefit to recipients and having the capacity to scale an idea,” Mr. Neichin said. Credit for devising this middle ground often goes to the Omidyar Network, which the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife, Pam, created as both a foundation and an impact investment firm. Matt Bannick, its former managing partner, said Mr. Omidyar had been hesitant at first to blur the lines. Instead, Mr. Bannick said, they focused on creating new markets. One example was d.light, which provided solar-powered lanterns to replace more dangerous kerosene lanterns in Africa. “We found when we loosened the constraint of financial returns, then the focus became even more about impact,” said Mr. Bannick, who is a co-author of the Bridgespan report. “If you’re getting 5 percent less on the return, then what are you going to get on the impact? Let’s be more explicit about the intended impact here.” The middle-ground approach is not without critics. One issue is that while the wealthy can take such risks for a low return, most investors cannot. Nor would investors in many of the typical impact funds be willing to accept lower returns for riskier investments. Getting a market-rate return is something impact investors are comfortable with, but a lower return makes it harder to attract enough investors, said Trenton Allen, managing director and chief executive of Sustainable Capital Advisors. “It’s not impossible,” he said. “But you’re narrowing the number of investors you have access to.” Traditional impact investors also argue that accepting different returns for different investments is already happening. Consider bondlike returns for fixed-income types of risk. “Impact investing is a big tent and should be a big tent,” said Nancy Pfund, managing partner at DBL Partners, an impact venture capital fund. “The challenge is, we shouldn’t muddy the waters and think impact-first is the only kind of investment. We also don’t want to step backward and deal with biases about returns that we have spent at least 10 years fighting.” Even those who have taken the approach agree that it is a luxury. “If the organizing priority is impact, that’s a privilege, but you have to have a deep tolerance for risk,” said Margot Kane, chief investment officer of Spring Point Partners, which is a social venture fund created by the Berwind family of Philadelphia, whose wealth dates to 19th-century coal mining. For anyone considering taking the middle ground, here are the two key questions: How do you determine if an investment qualifies as impact first? And since impact, not return, is the primary motivation, how do you measure it? Let’s start with selection. “One of the things we ask ourselves when we’re doing due diligence on one of these projects is, ‘Is this a really great catalytic investment or a very bad market-rate investment?’” said Liesel Pritzker Simmons, co-founder and principal of Blue Haven Initiative and a member of the family whose wealth derives from Hyatt hotels. “Honestly, it tends to come down to what is the problem they’re trying to solve and is the nature of that solution super-scalable or not?” she said. Members of the Berwind family invested through Spring Point in a convertible bond from Greenprint Partners, which improves storm water drainage in low-income communities. “They’re off to the races now, with more established lending partners now,” Ms. Kane said. “They graduated away from needing our support.” That type of success is one measure of effectiveness. But it’s not always easy to measure the impact. On climate issues, the accepted measurement is a ton of carbon dioxide or its equivalent, said Colin le Duc, a partner in Generation Investment Management, the impact-investing fund that former Vice President Al Gore co-founded. “With climate, you can measure how much is removed from the environment each year,” he said. “Beyond climate, the units of measurement aren’t as well accepted. How do you measure a unit of biodiversity? No one knows that. Something like education or poverty alleviation — there isn’t an accepted measurement.” At family foundations, the measurement can be something the family determines before making the investment. “We take a fairly light touch,” Ms. Pritzker Simmons said. “We want to know what the return is and what are the top three impact key performance indicators. One extra dimension is we look at with a catalytic investment is: Did it do what it said it was going to do, and did it scale?” Sometimes that is fairly apparent. An example: Pula is an organization that connects small farmers all over Africa with crop insurance and uses data to evaluate the yields from small farms so that crop insurers will write policies. It’s now working with 1.7 million farmers across 13 countries on the continent; those farmers have insurance for $600 million in agricultural investments, like the purchase of seeds and fertilizers. Rose Goslinga, co-chief executive and founder of Pula, said impact-first investment was what made the business possible. “Last year, we balanced the books,” she said. “Coming from a more traditional development background, I was happy we didn’t make a loss.”"
Technology After the Pandemic,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/business/dealbook/prosus-technology-deals.html,"Many companies made changes to survive the pandemic. For tech companies, the changes were also about seizing opportunities to thrive as life abruptly moved online. Few companies have juggled these risks and rewards in as many industries, across as many countries, as Prosus, an Amsterdam-based conglomerate that in 2019 was  , the South African tech and media giant. Prosus’ holdings run from e-commerce and classifieds to food delivery, fintech and more. The group is valued at around $180 billion, which makes it one of continental Europe’s 10 largest companies. It operates in more than 80 countries and owns sizable stakes in the internet giants Tencent of China and Mail.ru of Russia. The companies that Prosus controls employ around 20,000 people, and many more work as contractors or at companies in which Prosus holds smaller stakes. That breadth gives Bob van Dijk, the chief executive of Prosus, a unique vantage point from which to assess the tech industry’s fortunes, particularly in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia, India and China. Will pandemic habits persist? Can regulators rein in Big Tech? Have the markets gotten ahead of themselves? Mr. van Dijk sat down for a virtual interview to assess the tech world’s prospects in the years ahead. Prosus has fared relatively well during the pandemic. In the six months to September, the latest results available, its revenue and profit rose around 30 percent. Its stake in Tencent alone added nearly $3 billion to its bottom line over that time. When the pandemic hit, the downturn wasn’t felt evenly across the group’s portfolio. The upturn has similarly reflected how government stimulus, access to vaccines, mutations in the coronavirus and a host of other factors have varied from country to country. The hardest-hit markets where Prosus operates remain Latin America and South Africa, while Europe and North America suffered initial hits to their economies followed by spurts of recovery. Asia has largely bounced back. The pandemic lockdowns changed consumer behavior, forcing Prosus to adapt in ways that Mr. van Dijk believes will be permanent. “We don’t have any reason to believe they will go away,” he said, adding that the pandemic essentially “brought the future forward by a few years.” In short, that means greater automation and less human contact. “In our e-commerce business, we already had drop-off lockers,” Mr. van Dijk said. “That’s become very, very prevalent. We figured that people like it. It’s no-contact delivery.” Spurred by necessity, Prosus’ portfolio companies found other ways to wring efficiencies. “We found that more of our business can be automated than we thought,” he said. “That was pushing us further down the curve of making a very smooth customer experience that has as few touch points as possible.” For example, its classifieds business, OLX, began asking customers to inspect the cars for sale themselves, reducing social contact. “When forced, you can think creatively,” Mr. van Dijk said. Food delivery, unsurprisingly, has been as strong a business for Prosus during lockdowns as it has been for  ,   and others. But Prosus companies like Delivery Hero and iFood took steps to help preserve long-term good will with its partners at the expense of short-term profits. In Brazil, for example, “we paid restaurants much quicker than we usually did,” Mr. van Dijk said. “From a cash-flow point of view, that was actually pretty important” in keeping restaurants in their good graces, reducing   between restaurants struggling during the pandemic and online delivery apps seeing demand soar. It was a similar story in India for classifieds. “We reduced fees substantially, or we waived fees,” he said. “That allowed people to preserve cash. When things started to come back again, there was a lot of appreciation around that.” Though Prosus is emerging from the pandemic in a position of strength, Mr. van Dijk said the company wouldn’t be able to escape a global push by governments to constrain the power of tech giants in antitrust, labor and other areas. He’s not necessarily fighting the new wave of regulation, and offered a historical analogy: “When the first cars were in the world, there were no rules whatsoever. When there were more cars, that was not fine.” Advances in technology will naturally require the law to catch up, he said, calling the trend toward stricter regulation “a sensible move.” One major concern among tech giants is the rollout of so-called   throughout Europe, meant to collect more revenue from multinational companies that do extensive business in countries without much of a physical presence within their borders. Those wouldn’t apply to Prosus, Mr. van Dijk said — “we invest locally and pay taxes” — but he added that the charges could erode the industry’s profit margins. “I understand where it comes from,” he said, but “sometimes the regulation is a little blunt.” What could hurt Prosus, Mr. van Dijk said, are changes to the gig economy, particularly efforts to  . Some drivers prefer the flexibility of being contractors, he said, and “we try to pay people properly regardless of what the legislation is.” As far as he could recall, Prosus has never lobbied against classifying workers as employees, as rivals like Uber have. Another area to watch is China, which has moved to rein in some of its homegrown internet behemoths. Though officials have focused largely on Alibaba, Tencent hasn’t escaped their gaze: The company, which Prosus bought into back in 2001, was among those fined last month for  . It is Prosus’ single biggest investment, and a tougher crackdown could batter the conglomerate’s market value. Despite the stakes, Mr. van Dijk downplayed the threat. “Our impression is that China is still very supportive of its tech giants,” he said. The enormous financial rescue plans enacted by many governments to combat the pandemic unleashed a torrent of money into the global monetary system. Much of that money made its way into the tech sector. “Market valuations for technology have become quite full,” Mr. van Dijk said. “There’s a lot of money looking for a return.” Last summer, Prosus was outbid for eBay’s classifieds business, which went to   for $9.2 billion. That defeat followed a losing effort to acquire the restaurant delivery company Just Eat, which   for $7.8 billion. Perhaps surprisingly, Mr. van Dijk said Prosus hadn’t encountered much competition from special purpose acquisition companies, or  , which have raised nearly $100 billion this year and are very active acquirers of tech companies. This may be in part because SPACs are largely a U.S. phenomenon, although other countries have been trying to court the blank-check firms. Mr. van Dijk said Prosus might eventually find itself competing with SPACs, particularly for later-stage private companies. In the meantime, Prosus itself   last year when the shell company merged with Skillsoft, an education technology firm. Lately, Prosus has mostly been investing in its existing businesses. “Putting money into there is still a good idea,” Mr. van Dijk said. And a few months ago the company announced that it would buy back $5 billion of its shares. Things are looking slightly more measured these days, Mr. van Dijk said, with valuations coming down “to much more sustainable levels.” For a serial dealmaker, that means opportunity: “It’s easier to do acquisitions in a market that is cooling off.” What do you think? Can tech companies maintain the momentum they’ve gained during pandemic? Is the market cooling off? Let us know: "
Pandemic Helps Stir Interest in Teaching Financial Literacy,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/your-money/financial-literacy-courses.html,"Two dozen state legislatures are considering bills on financial literacy education, an unusually high number, proponents say. They attribute the interest to concern about the burden of student debt, as well as heightened awareness about income and economic inequality as a result of the pandemic. “There’s a recognition that folks are being left behind,” said Tim Ranzetta, founder of Next Gen Personal Finance, a nonprofit group that creates free courses and funds training for high school teachers. Next Gen compiled   of bills submitted for consideration in 25 states. It’s unclear how many will pass, Mr. Ranzetta said. As of early 2020, high school students in 21 states were required to take a personal finance course to graduate, according to the  , which promotes economic and personal finance education for students in kindergarten through high school. That was a net gain of four states since the council’s previous count two years earlier. “We are making progress,” said Billy J. Hensley, president and chief executive of the National Endowment for Financial Education, a nonprofit group that promotes effective financial education. “I do think the pandemic is bringing more attention to the topic,” he said, noting that after the financial crisis more than a decade ago there was also a flurry of financial literacy proposals in state legislatures. An increasing number of studies support the effectiveness of financial literacy education when taught by well-trained teachers, said Nan J. Morrison, chief executive of the Council for Economic Education. And more teachers now say they feel confident teaching the material.   released in March by researchers at the University of Wisconsin and Montana State University found significant increases in teacher participation in professional development. Still, the rigor of high school financial education varies. Just six states require high school students to complete a semester-long, stand-alone personal finance course, the council’s 2020 report found. Some states permit shorter courses or include the content as part of another class. In states that don’t require financial instruction, some schools opt to teach it and do an excellent job, but others ignore the subject completely — and they tend to be schools in less affluent districts, Mr. Hensley said. In the latest round of legislative proposals, some states are merely encouraging the teaching of financial skills while a few would make the subject a graduation requirement. Ohio, for instance, is considering a proposal that would require high school students to pass a half-credit class in personal finance in order to graduate. The class must be taught by a teacher trained in the subject matter. The bill would also create a fund to help pay for training to teach the subject, said State Senator Steve Wilson, a Republican and former banking executive who co-sponsored the bill. He said he was hopeful that the bill would be voted out of committee this month. “Kids come out of school having no clue about financial literacy,” Senator Wilson said. “You go out into the world greatly disadvantaged.” Many financial literacy advocates consider a full-semester course the gold standard for personal finance instruction. Rebecca Maxcy, director of the Financial Education Initiative at the University of Chicago, said many courses focused mainly on skills, like writing a check or filing taxes. While those lessons can be helpful, she said, it’s important for courses to include discussions of how personal values and attitudes about money influence behavior, as well as an examination of the financial systems and potential barriers that students will encounter in the world of money. Questions like “Who benefits when you open a bank account?” can prompt meaningful discussions, she said. Some curriculum options, however, offer more condensed, basic instruction. Everfi, a digital instructional company, offers a free seven-session program for high school financial literacy. Students take interactive, self-guided lessons in topics like banking, budgeting and college financing. Sidney Strause, a freshman at Marshall University in West Virginia, said she had taken Everfi’s course as a junior in high school. The lessons were assigned as part of another course she was taking, and typically took 45 minutes to an hour to complete. “It taught me how to budget and save,” she said. “It’s crucial to adulthood.” Sometimes she would do the lessons at home and discuss them with her mother, she said, which led her mother to create a budget and set financial goals. Several groups, including the Council on Economic Education, provide guidance on quality educational materials. The council publishes   and benchmarks, the University of Chicago’s Financial Education Initiative has created  of characteristics for “high quality” financial education, and the  , a nonprofit group, maintains a list of educational programs. Here are some questions and answers about financial literacy: While results vary, recent studies suggest that “well-implemented” state education mandates lead to a “clear improvement in financial behaviors,” according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   from the National Endowment for Financial Education, for instance, found that required financial education could help students make smarter decisions about paying for college. Ms. Maxcy of the Financial Education Initiative said that talking with a parent or trusted adult about money issues could be a powerful learning tool for students, but that it was often difficult for parents to start conversations. The program’s research led to the creation of a deck of 105 “Talking Cents” cards that pose simple questions to start a discussion. One example: “What career would you choose if all jobs paid the same amount of money?” Or, “Describe an experience you had with a credit card, good or bad.” They’re available on the  . Parents can search  , an initiative of the JumpStart Coalition, to see what their school offers."
,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/business/james-quincey-coca-cola-corner-office.html,"When James Quincey became chief executive of Coca-Cola in 2017, it’s fair to say he wasn’t focused on how to articulate the company’s position on the issue of voting rights. Instead, Mr. Quincey, who grew up in Birmingham, England, and has spent most of his career outside the United States, was consumed with the usual C.E.O. fare — expanding the business, keeping the share price up and not damaging the brand. But in a measure of just how much politics has permeated big business these days, Mr. Quincey is now embroiled in a fierce debate over a wave of Republican legislation that would effectively make it harder for people to vote, including many Black voters, in some states. As one such law made its way through the Georgia legislature in recent weeks, activists began to call on Coca-Cola, which has its headquarters in Atlanta, to publicly oppose the proposed law. Though the company doesn’t have a history of weighing in on voting rights one way or another, big companies have become increasingly drawn into social and political conversations in recent years. As a vote on the law drew near, Mr. Quincey was under pressure to pick a side. Coca-Cola ultimately issued   saying that “voting is a foundational right in America” and pledging to “work to advance voting rights and access in Georgia and across the country.” But it didn’t publicly weigh in on the legislation before Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed it into law last Thursday. The company’s cautious response drew protests and calls for a boycott from activists, who wanted Coca-Cola, along with other major Georgia companies like Delta Air Lines, to speak out against the new law. More than   called on corporations to do more to protect voting rights. As the week went on, more companies and even sports leagues spoke out. Dell and American Airlines   a restrictive voting bill being advanced in Texas, and Major League Baseball   it would move the All-Star Game from Atlanta in protest of the new law. Hours after the Black executives made their statement, Mr. Quincey forcefully came out against the Georgia law for the first time. “I want to be crystal clear,”  . “The Coca-Cola Company does not support this legislation, as it makes it harder for people to vote, not easier.” The statement was welcomed by activists, though many said it was too little, too late. Yet at the same time, Mr. Quincey’s words drew the ire of prominent conservatives, with Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Fox News host Laura Ingraham and Stephen Miller, an adviser to former President Donald J. Trump, attacking the company on Twitter. Laws similar to the one just passed in Georgia have been proposed in nearly every state, and, in part to combat that, Congress is working on a sweeping bill that would reform voting rights nationwide. Already, activists dissatisfied with the company’s response in Georgia are pressing the company to do more around the country, while conservatives call on Coca-Cola, and Mr. Quincey, to stay out of politics. It was another illustration, as if one was needed, of how the political polarization straining the country is creating fault lines in corporate America, with big brands caught in the middle. The following was condensed and edited from two conversations, the second of which took place six days after the Georgia law was passed. What changed is the legislation passed. The process was curtailed, was rushed, was not profound enough, and the resulting legislation is unacceptable, and it needs to be corrected. Work needs to be done to make this a step forward, not a step backward, in terms of broader access to voting, and that’s what we’re going to continue to advocate for as we go into this next phase. Whatever we were doing before was not getting through. People are misconstruing, by honest error or willfully, what we have stood for and what we’re trying to do. Obviously they could disagree whether you should do more or less in private and public. But there’s enough stories out there saying the opposite of what we’ve actually said and believe in. We have to go and correct that at the very minimum, and most importantly, we need to generate some clarity that we’re going to continue to advocate against this bill. No one in the legislature was under any illusion as to our views on the various drafts or even the final law. They knew. Would it have made any difference if we had said anything publicly? We’ll never know. If we could have done something in retrospect to have made a different outcome, of course, we would have preferred to have done it. Because we don’t like the outcome. We’re a Georgia-based company. That’s going to be certainly our starting point. I don’t see us having the wherewithal to understand every nuance in every other state. I think there will be energy directed at the federal level. If you go back historically, federal oversight of changing the voting processes in the states has been an important process to make sure that things move forward, not backward. It’s not that the corporate community was not involved. We were perhaps not as public as some people wish we had been, or perhaps would have made more difference. You’ve got this tension of getting companies involved — the tension of dragging, or having companies pulled, into politics. When do I get involved? You can’t possibly be involved in every issue. So getting clear on what are the most important things to your company is what we go back to. We’re very clear on the importance of diversity and inclusion to the Coca-Cola Company, which aspires to be a brand for everyone, and particularly in the South, given its history. We stand for diversity and inclusion in Georgia above all else, and that’s why we came to the table on this issue. We tried to effect change. It didn’t work. But we have not given up by any stretch of the imagination. When you become C.E.O. you think you’ve got this organizational pyramid and you’ve come at the apex, and now everyone works for you. But then you find out there’s another pyramid, but it’s upside down, and you’re the one person at the bottom. There’s a huge number of stakeholders who want to tell you what to do, and many of them don’t work in the business. So you deal with the board, the media, the investors, the analysts, the NGOs, the government. You have this whole galaxy of people you need to deal with in a way that was never true for any of the other jobs. If you haven’t gotten really clear on what are the few things that I want to tell people about and prioritize things this, it can be quite destabilizing. The first step is to realize that something’s going wrong. When you’re a famous brand and a famous company, issues get brought to your door every day. If you want to get attention to something, calling it Coke’s fault, or thinking that Coke could help us get this fixed, is much easier than doing that with Acme, Inc., who no one’s heard of. That doesn’t mean we should bury our heads in the sand. We need to look at them and work out, whether we agree it’s a real problem, and what are we in favor of as part of the solution? We can’t solve everything. The starting point is: What does the consumer really want? They want great tasting drinks. And what’s the consequence of some of that? The total food and beverage diet is delivering too many calories and too much sugar. You can get that answer from any health professional. OK. So are we going to tell the consumers what to drink? Are we going to restrict them? We still want to grow our business. But what’s our role in a problem where people are consuming too many calories and too much sugar? We need to get our sugar footprint, for want of a better expression, to go down. We need the business to grow because if we just sign up to a shrinking business, there’ll be a shareholder revolt. We have to sign up to a growing business with a shrinking sugar footprint. What does that require? Well, it requires us to drive the zero calorie products. It requires us to drive into smaller package sizes. And we need to innovate in drinks that are inherently lower calorie or lower sugar. If we do that, we can actually grow the business and reduce the sugar footprint. Half our business is away from home. So with the cinemas closed, the airlines, the hotels, you can see how much it’s down. But what did grow, because people were obliged effectively to spend more time at home, was a resurgence in breakfast. We used to all get up and rush out of apartments to go to work, and many people skip breakfast. Well, now they have more time for it. So juice sales were up."
Strong U.S. Job Growth in March Fuels Optimism on Recovery,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/business/economy/jobs-report-march.html,"The American job market roared back to life in March — and with vaccinations accelerating, businesses reopening and federal aid flowing, the rebound should only get stronger from here. U.S. employers added 916,000 jobs last month, twice as many as in February and the most since August, the Labor Department said Friday. The   fell to 6 percent, its lowest level since the coronavirus pandemic began, and nearly 350,000 people rejoined the labor force. The data was collected early in the month, before most states broadened vaccine access and before most Americans began  as part of the latest federal relief package. It was also before the recent rise in virus cases, which economists warned could slow the recovery if it worsened. But on balance, forecasters are optimistic that hiring will remain strong in coming months. “March’s jobs report is the most optimistic report since the pandemic began,” said Daniel Zhao, senior economist for the career site Glassdoor. “It’s not the largest gain in payrolls since the pandemic began, but it’s the first where it seems like the finish line is in sight.”  on Friday, hailed the report as evidence that both his economic and public health initiatives are bearing fruit. “My message to the American people is this,” he said. “Help is here, opportunity is coming, and at long last there is hope for so many families.” Mr. Biden said the report was also a reminder of the deep hole created by the pandemic. The United States still has 8.4 million fewer jobs than in February 2020. Even if employers kept hiring at the pace they did in March, it would take months to fill the gap. And if   turns into a full-blown new wave of infections, it could force some states to reimpose restrictions, impeding the recovery. But few economists expect a repeat of the winter, when a spike in Covid-19 cases pushed the recovery into reverse. More than a quarter of U.S. adults have received at least  , and more than two million people a day are being inoculated. “This time is different, and that’s because of vaccines,” said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at the job site ZipRecruiter. “It’s real this time.” Heather Stidham lost her job at an Atlanta-area Olive Garden last spring and hasn’t worked since. But on Monday, she will start a new job working for the State of Georgia, processing applications for rental assistance as part of a federally funded aid program. “My whole attitude, my whole way of thinking has shifted,” Ms. Stidham, 43, said. “I feel like a thousand pounds had been lifted off of me, just to know I’d be getting a paycheck again.” Still, getting back to work won’t undo the damage of the past year. Ms. Stidham is months behind on her rent, and fears she won’t be able to catch up in time to avoid eviction. And the extended period out of work has affected her mental and physical health in ways that won’t be easy to reverse. “It’s affecting our lives in every way,” she said. “It becomes fight or flight. You go into survival mode.” More than four million people have been out of work for more than six months, a number that continued rising in March. Millions more are out of the labor force entirely — with people who are not looking for work factored in, the unemployment rate would be above 9 percent. And the rebound has been uneven: The unemployment rate among Asians rose nearly a point in March, while Black workers have seen slower job gains than other groups. “What we need is an acceleration of the vaccinations and an acceleration of hiring,” said William E. Spriggs, a Howard University professor and the chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. “We need that to give confidence to the people that have been sitting on the sidelines.” There are signs that is already happening. Nearly half a million women joined the labor force in March, which economists attributed in part to the return of in-person schooling in much of the country. “You open schools, and imagine what happens — women return to the work force,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist for the accounting firm Grant Thornton. Job gains in March were broad based. The leisure and hospitality sector added 280,000 jobs as Americans returned to restaurants and resorts in greater numbers, and construction businesses added 110,000 as activity resumed after winter storms in February. Schools, both public and private, added 190,000 jobs in March. But retailers, manufacturers and transportation companies added jobs as well, which Ms. Swonk said showed that the recovery was being driven by more than just the reopening of shuttered businesses. Government aid has given Americans money to spend, and the confidence to spend it. Businesses, too, appear to be growing more confident. Many of the jobs added in January and February were temporary positions, but in March, temporary staffing levels were essentially flat, indicating companies were filling permanent positions instead. Amy Glaser, senior vice president at the staffing firm Adecco, said that in recent weeks, a growing share of her clients had been looking for permanent employees, or converting temporary hires into permanent ones. “Our conversations have really shifted even over the last six weeks,” she said. “We spent the last year doing a lot of worst-case-scenario planning with our clients, and now the conversation is the opposite: How do we capture the rebound to make the most effective use of it?” When Main Event Entertainment, which runs 44 family entertainment centers in 17 states, began reopening its doors in June, business was initially slow. But in recent weeks, customers have begun to come back in greater numbers. “It’s been a very slow, gradual improvement, and then during spring break it was a step up,” said Chris Morris, the company’s chief executive officer. “We believe there is pent-up demand. There have been a lot of missed birthday parties.” In response, Main Event is going on a hiring spree. The company is aiming to increase its staff by about 20 percent, adding roughly 1,000 positions. “The worst thing we could do is not be ready when our guests come in, and they have a lousy experience,” Mr. Morris said. “So we’re trying to get ahead of that curve.” Businesses have good reason to be optimistic. Even before the latest round of stimulus checks, Americans had $1 trillion more in savings than before the pandemic — money they could now begin spending on restaurant meals, vacations and concert tickets. About 35 percent of Americans plan to spend more on travel over the next 12 months than they do in a typical year, according to a survey conducted last month for The New York Times by the online research firm  . About 28 percent plan to spend more than usual at restaurants. And over all, close to 70 percent of adults plan to spend more than usual in at least one category, at least if the health situation allows. “They have the money in the bank, they’re ready to spend it, but what was holding them back was not having a comfort about being able to go out,” said Jay Bryson, chief economist for Wells Fargo. “We’re getting into a critical mass of people that are feeling comfortable beginning to go out again.” Lori San Martin, a personal trainer and Pilates instructor in Los Angeles, has spent most of the past year staying in and cooking at home. She was able to retain a couple clients, doing training sessions behind masks and at a distance, and unemployment benefits and a forbearance on her mortgage payments helped her avoid financial ruin. But she watched her spending carefully. “We just weren’t going anywhere, spending money,” she said. “I didn’t buy clothes. The only thing that went up was our grocery bill.” Last month, however, Ms. San Martin, 67, was able to get vaccinated, and many of her former clients were as well. As a result, business is bouncing back, even as federal aid checks have stabilized her finances. Now, her spending is bouncing back as well. Ms. San Martin recently got her first haircut since the pandemic began, and last weekend, she and her boyfriend went out to a long-delayed dinner at a restaurant. They left a $100 tip.

,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/business/readers-pandemic-burnout.html,"At this point in the pandemic, it feels that we have, all, collectively, hit a wall. Last week, The New York Times   to tell us about work burnout they’re experiencing — nearly 700 people responded in two days. The responses were funny, vulnerable and indicative of a universal sense of: “We’ve had enough.” The collective picture they painted was of a work force struggling to do tasks that were once easy, people who know they are lucky to have a job but dream of quitting, and who would do anything to never have a Zoom meeting again. Here’s what else we heard from readers. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity, and some people preferred to give only their first names. “Waking up and realizing, ‘I am going to stare at my laptop for 8 hours, maybe 9, maybe 10, log off, feel utterly unaccomplished because I have not left my small office/bedroom/yoga studio for the entire day, and do it all again for who knows how long.’ At this point I don’t know who is going to crack first, me or the pandemic.” — Stephanie Soderlund, chemist, Portland, Ore. “Logging off at the end of the day. It’s nearly impossible. Once the world went into lockdown a year ago, I felt like I logged onto work and I’m still waiting to log off.” — Natalie Fiacco, art director, New York “All of it. I can’t focus at all. Every day is Groundhog Day. I get up, I drink tea, I spend 8-12 hours in front of the computer, I listen to podcasts all day while I work, I spend too much time on social media, and then I go to bed. We’ve barely left the flat in over a year now. I’m lucky to have a job, but I fantasize about quitting all the time.” — Lee Anne Sittler, translator, Madrid “The Microsoft Teams ringtone strikes fear in my heart and the Slack buzz dread in my spirit.” — Carolyn, graphic designer, Brooklyn “I’m juggling child care, teaching a kindergartner and also being timed for each activity at work. In social services, it takes a lot of emotional labor in normal times, now we have had nearly 300 percent increase in folks seeking our assistance” — Risa, public benefits eligibility specialist, Tacoma, Wash. “How do I log the hours I spent crying or staring out my window? (Spoiler: I can’t, because those things aren’t monetizable.)” — Julie Bourne, content strategist, Brooklyn “I’ve come to rely very much on the story of the Exodus during the past year, the story of ancient Israel’s time in the wilderness as both a time of trial, but also a time of preparation for what comes next.” — Todd Vetter, pastor, Madison, Conn. “I have been playing D&D every week through Discord with a group of friends. It has served as the closest thing to a routine that I have now, and a moment of respite to actually feel connected to other human beings.” — Silas Choudhury, student, Jersey City, N.J. “I dream about vacations to which I cannot drive.” — Alexandra Robinson, art professor, Austin, Texas “Getting outside in the morning makes the most difference on preventing motivational flatlining, but unless I have an accountability buddy it’s easy to skip. I skip more now than I was a year ago.” — Prajna Cole, project manager, Eugene, Ore. “I try to remember that pandemics don’t last forever.” — Jason, high school teacher, Virginia “I focus on my family, on keeping them happy and healthy. I also eat jelly beans.” — Dr. Yemina Warshaver, emergency medicine physician, New York"
,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/business/brexit-easter-chocolate.html,"LONDON — For the second year in a row, Easter will be a largely online affair, with socially distanced egg hunts and virtual church services. But there will be one notable difference here in the Britain. Domestic chocolate makers, who should be celebrating one of their busiest times of year, are fuming instead, and all of them cite the same cause: Brexit. “We’ve lost our entire European trade,” said Aneesh Popat, the owner of The Chocolatier, which sells dark chocolate salted caramel water ganache Easter eggs and other treats out of Bedfordshire, about 50 miles north of London. “Worse than that, we’ve lost our reputation, because when we send pallets of chocolate to, say, Germany and it disappears or we can’t track it, our customers don’t blame the courier. They blame us.”  with the European Union spared Britain from a variety of tariffs that would have inflated the prices of goods that traveled to the mainland. It has not saved British companies from a maddening, unpredictable array of time-consuming, morale-sapping procedures and from stacks of paperwork that have turned exporting to the E.U. into a sort of black-box mystery. Goods go in and there is no telling when they will come out. Or how much customs duties will cost the recipient. Or even where the goods will ultimately land. “We sent a palette of drinking chocolate to a customer in Paris on Jan. 4, and it came back to our company yesterday,” Mr. Popat said on April 1. “It’s just embarrassing. “So we decided that instead of trying to explain that we have no idea where our shipments to Europe have gone, we should just stop shipping there,” he added. Complaints about long and bewildering forms and wayward merchandise  . In November the government predicted that the country would suffer the worst recession in three centuries because of the pandemic and forecast that the economy would shrink by 11.3 percent. At the same time, the Boris Johnson administration has minimized the ongoing migraine of post-Brexit trading with Europe, describing the matter as “teething problems.” To chocolate makers, the issues feel more like bites that are going to leave a mark. Chocolate is the U.K.’s second-largest food and drink export, after whiskey, according to the Food and Drink Federation. Chocolate exports to all countries hit $1.1 billion last year, and Europe accounts for about 70 percent of those sales. In January, exports of British chocolate to Europe fell 68 percent compared with the same period the year before. The industry is dominated by a handful of players, including Cadbury, one of the largest candy makers in the world . But following a boom of artisanal “bean-to-bar” makers in the states, dozens of family-run companies cropped up around Britain, emphasizing ethically sourced ingredients and bespoke batches. They became big sellers in Europe but have been nearly impossible to find there since January. “We have customers complain to us all the time, ‘Why can’t I buy my favorite British chocolate?’” said Hishem Ferjani, the founder of Choco Dealer in Bonn, Germany, which supplies grocery stores and sells through its own website. “We have store owners with empty shelves.” “We have to explain, it’s not our fault, it’s not the fault of the producer. It’s Brexit,” he said. Mr. Ferjani has a list of 100 customers who have asked for alerts once British chocolate starts arriving again. One of them is Simone Schlief, a fan of The Chocolate Tree, an Edinburgh maker of what the company describes as “visually stunning works of edible art crafted in small batches.” She’s especially fond of the whiskey-flavored nibs the company makes. “So is my mother,” she said. “I would definitely would have bought some for Easter, but I would have been buying them every month.” Alastair Gower, the owner of The Chocolate Tree, is just as annoyed. He has managed to successfully send exactly one batch of product to Europe since Brexit. And there were plenty of snafus along the way. The shipment of about $8,000 worth of chocolate sat in limbo for weeks on its way to Holland. Once it finally arrived, his customer was asked to pay the equivalent of about $5,000 in duties because Mr. Gower had not filled out the import statement correctly. “We’d been told the product would arrive in France, so we put Calais as the point of entry. It went to Rotterdam, where it sat for six weeks,” he said. “Chocolate. Sitting in a warehouse. For six weeks.” Through a shipping agent, he managed to get the import duty dropped. He learned a lesson about filling out forms, but that expertise won’t help him much. “It’s impossible to find shippers that will deliver to Europe,” he said, “because there’s a backlog of goods in the pipeline.” At Coco Caravan, a chocolate maker in the Cotswolds, the stasis has meant that Europe has gone from 15 percent of the company’s revenue to zero. That has caused Jacques Cop, the owner, to disappoint old customers and put off new ones. In recent months, prospective buyers in the Netherlands, France and Germany have expressed interest. “They say, ‘We found you online and love everything you do in terms of being ethically sourced and vegan, but how are you going to combat the import-export problem we will have with the European Union?’” said Mr. Cop. “We can’t give them a clear answer, other than, ‘Yes, there will be additional costs involved.’” Mr. Cop is also confronting a challenge common among small chocolate makers in Britain: importing raw ingredients from Europe. He stockpiled cacao in 2020 from his source of choice in Amsterdam. Now that it is time to buy more, obstacles have emerged. Transportation costs have doubled, which is bad enough. But Mr. Cop says his shipper refuses to take new orders because of worries that a shipment will somehow get blocked between Amsterdam and Britain. “It’s to the point where I’m thinking of borrowing a Renault van and just driving to the Netherlands myself,” Mr. Cop said. “It’s a 10-hour drive each way. But I’m not sure I have another choice.”"
,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/business/pandemic-burnout-productivity.html,"Like many of us, the writer Susan Orlean is having a hard time concentrating these days. “Good morning to everyone,”  , “but especially to the sentence I just rewrote for the tenth time.” “I feel like I’m in quicksand,” she explained by phone from California, where she has been under quasi-house arrest for the last year. “I’m just so exhausted all the time. I’m doing so much less than I normally do — I’m not traveling, I’m not entertaining, I’m just sitting in front of my computer — but I am accomplishing way less. It’s like a whole new math. I have more time and fewer obligations, yet I’m getting so much less done.” Call it a late-pandemic crisis of productivity, of will, of enthusiasm, of purpose. Call it a bout of existential work-related ennui provoked partly by the realization that sitting in the same chair in the same room staring at the same computer for 12 straight months (and counting!) has left many of us feeling like burned-out husks, dimwitted approximations of our once-productive selves. What time is it? What day is it? What did we do in October? Why are we standing in front of the refrigerator staring at an old clove of garlic? Just recently I myself spent half an hour struggling to retrieve a word from the faulty memory system that has replaced my prepandemic brain. (“Institution.” That was the word.) Sometimes, when I try to write a simple email, I feel I’m just pushing disjointed words around, like peas on a plate, hoping they will eventually coalesce into sentences. Am I excited about my daily work in this month of April, 2021? I would have to say that I am not. “Malaise, burnout, depression and stress — all of those are up considerably,” said Todd Katz, executive vice president and head of group benefits at MetLife. The company’s most recent Employee Benefit Trends Study, conducted in December and January, found that workers across the board felt markedly worse than they did last April. The study was based in part on interviews with 2,651 employees. In total, 34 percent of respondents reported feeling burned out, up from 27 percent last April. Twenty-two percent said they were depressed, up from 17 percent last April, and 37 percent said they felt stressed, up from 34 percent. “People are saying they’re less productive, less engaged, that they don’t feel as successful,” Mr. Katz said. No kidding. In this very bad year, of course, there are gradations of loss: loss of homes, of health, of income; the deaths of family members and other loved ones; the absence of security. In the most recent  , by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 37 percent of those surveyed reported feeling anxious or depressed (in 2019, the figure was 11 percent). In the scheme of things, people who have jobs are lucky. But that doesn’t mean work itself is easy, or fun. “I feel fried,” said Erin H., a social media and event coordinator at a Midwestern university, whose work once inspired and excited her but currently seems like an unpleasant cocktail of boredom, dread and exhaustion. (She asked that her last name not be used so as not to upset her employers.) Things take longer to get done, she said, in part because she doesn’t want to do them. “I’m out of ideas and have zero motivation to even get to a point where I feel inspired,” she wrote, responding to a request by The New York Times for people to describe their work- related challenges in Month 13 of the pandemic. “Every time my inbox dings, I feel a pang of dread.” None of that is surprising, said Margaret Wehrenberg, an expert on anxiety and the author of the book “Pandemic Anxiety: Fear, Stress, and Loss in Traumatic Times.” A year of uncertainty, of being whipsawed between anxiety and depression, of seeing expert predictions wither away and goal posts shift, has left many people feeling that they are existing in a kind of fog, the world shaded in gray. “When people are under a long period of chronic, unpredictable stress, they develop behavioral anhedonia,” Dr. Wehrenberg said, meaning the loss of the ability to take pleasure in their activities. “And so they get lethargic, and they show a lack of interest — and obviously that plays a huge role in productivity.” Nearly 700 people responded to The Times’s questions, and the picture they painted was of a work force at its collective wits’ end. We heard from a clergyperson, a pastry chef, an I.C.U. nurse, a probation officer, a fast-food worker. Budget analysts, librarians, principals, college students holed up in childhood bedrooms, project managers, interns, real estate agents — their mood was strikingly similar, though their circumstances were different. As one respondent said, no matter how many lists she makes, “I find myself falling back into deep pajamaville.” “I don’t think there’s anyone in the world who cannot say that the last year hasn’t been the hardest they’ve ever had,” Elizabeth Abend, 41, said in an interview. As head of human resources at a small chain of boutique fitness studios, Ms. Abend, who lives in Manhattan, has faced a cascade of challenges: having to tell casual employees there was no work; navigating uncertainty over when, and how, to reopen; pivoting to new digital services. And there has been loneliness, the death of her beloved dog, her own severe bout with Covid-19 last spring and the need, she said, “to be an adult human and pay bills and eat meals and all of that amid the exhaustion of having our entire world turned on its head.” “So many things seem like so much more work than my brain can possibly manage,” she said: sending routine emails, brushing her teeth after every meal, reading a novel. She has started drinking coffee from a mug that says, “Apathy Is the Best Whatever.” “It feels like the Kübler-Ross stages of grief, bouncing around you in a sort of circle. I feel like I’ve done all of them at least twice,” she said. At least she loves her job, she added. “And I’m fine — I’m not dead.” Natasha Rajah, a professor of psychiatry at McGill University who specializes in memory and the brain, said the longevity of the pandemic — endless monotony laced with acute anxiety — had contributed to a sense that time was moving differently, as if this past year were a long, hazy, exhausting experience lasting forever and no time at all. The stress and tedium, she said, have dulled our ability to form meaningful new memories. “There’s definitely a change in how people are reporting memories and cognitive experiences,” Professor Rajah said. “They have fewer rich details about their personal memories, and more negative content to their memories.” This means, she said, that people may be having a harder time forming working memories and paying attention, with “a reduced ability to hold things in their minds, manipulate thoughts and plan for the future.” Add to that a general loneliness, social isolation, anxiety and depression, she said, and it is not surprising that they are having trouble focusing on their work. “Honestly, weirdly, sometimes when I’m writing I just stop and stare at the wall,” said Valerie M., a doctoral candidate in clinical psychology in Michigan who asked that her full name not be used because she did not want her employers to hear how her workdays are going. “The staring at the wall contributes to the time warp. I’m like, ‘I spent the whole day, and I really didn’t do anything.’ Not that I did anything fun, either. It’s like, ‘Wow, I don’t even know what I did.’” Prolonged stress will do that to you, said Mike Yassa, professor of neuroscience and the director of the UCI Brain Initiative at the University of California, Irvine. “Stress is OK in small amounts, but when it extends over time it’s very dangerous,” he said. “It disrupts our cycles of sleep and our regular routines in things like exercise and physical activity — all these things make it very difficult for the body to be resilient.” Resilience does seem in short supply, especially as basic things like exercising, getting dressed and making an effort to appear enthusiastic on Zoom have fallen by the wayside. “My brain simply cannot focus long enough to form full sentences,” the grant director for a nonprofit organization wrote in response to The Times’s questions. A college student said: “I’m so burnt out that even this form is way, way too long.” On our questionnaire, we asked how people have tried to combat their feelings of malaise. Some are meditating, turning to “alcohol or edibles,” walking, making the bed, re-engaging with a spiritual practice. (“I’ve come to rely very much on the story of the Exodus,” a clergyperson wrote.) But in general, your guess for how to make this strange period easier is as good as anyone’s. “I don’t know,” one person wrote. “If you find out, tell me.”"
