UK looked at buying area of Svalbard to boost fishing waters and set up spy post
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/03/uk-looked-buying-area-svalbard-boost-fishing-waters-set-spy/,"Britain considered buying an area of Svalbard north of the Arctic Circle to provide a listening post for spies and to increase its post-Brexit fishing waters. Then-foreign minister Tobias Ellwood pursued attempts to buy land on the Norwegian archipelago, a group of islands north-east of Greenland, the last inhabited place before the North Pole.  The plans were disclosed by Mr Ellwood’s former colleague in the Foreign Office Sir Alan Duncan, at a time when Boris Johnson was Foreign Secretary. His diary of his time in office – titled In The Thick Of It: the Explosive Diaries of a Former Tory Minister – was serialised on Saturday in a national newspaper. In an entry dated Feb 1 2017, Sir Alan wrote: “[Tobias] Ellwood has a nutty proposal that the UK should buy Svalbard, the archipelago between Norway and the North Pole — he wants it to become a UK spaceport. He’s bonkers."" The following day, Sir Alan recorded that Mr Ellwood had previously tried to persuade Philip Hammond when he was foreign secretary to buy the islands. He said: “Ellwood is still on his Svalbard kick. Apparently he tried it before with Hammond, who just bawled him out and never spoke to him again. The Norwegians think we’ve gone totally nuts.” On Saturday Mr Ellwood confirmed the UK had tried to persuade the Government to buy a section of the main island in the Svalbard archipelago for $250million (£212million). Mr Ellwood, who is now chairman of the Defence select committee, described the plot of land, which was offered through a broker, as “a serious bit of real estate”. He told The Telegraph: “From a geo-strategic perspective, it is a bit like Ascension Island, the Falklands or indeed Gibraltar for us to have as a base. “From a strategic and military perspective I thought it would be very useful to have.” Mr Ellwood said communications with satellites were clearer on Svalbard because its location in the north meant the surface speed of the Earth’s rotation is slower. The deal – if it had gone ahead – would have come with rights to fishing waters as well as any oil and gas reserves. The majority of the archipelago is home to polar bears and is largely covered with glaciers. Britain could also have used the site to eavesdrop on other countries. “As a listening station it would have been quite incredible,” Mr Ellwood said. “My concern was to deny China the purchase of a strategic land base.” Mr Ellwood said he had raised it with Mr Hammond – not when he was foreign secretary between 2014 and 2016, but he was “not interested in it at all”. David Cameron, as prime minister, “very much liked it but the civil servants said we can’t really afford this at this time”, he said. Mr Johnson was also keen as he liked to encourage “as much blue sky thinking as possible” when he was foreign secretary between 2016 and 2018, Mr Ellwood said. Mr Ellwood – who served as a Foreign Office minister from 2014 to 2017 – blamed a “risk averseness” among civil servants for the sale not going through. The Foreign Office declined to respond to questions from The Telegraph. A source said the department was “not going to comment on the musings of an ex-junior minister”."

Gupta acquired Scottish hunting estate in taxpayer-backed deal with SNP
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/03/gupta-acquired-scottish-hunting-estate-taxpayer-backed-deal/,"Troubled steel tycoon Sanjeev Gupta secured ownership of a 114,000-acre Scottish hunting estate via an ­offshore company after he acquired it in a deal backed by the taxpayer. Mr Gupta’s family owns Jahama Highland Estates via an Isle of Man vehicle after he purchased it in a ­package deal with an aluminium smelter in Lochaber, the area surrounding Fort William. Nicola Sturgeon’s administration has said that it provided backing for the deal on condition that the assets would not be broken up. Mr Gupta’s   also committed to transferring part of the land to local community ownership, according to local politicians. Mr Gupta’s activities are under close scrutiny as his empire, which in the UK includes 5,000 workers and crucial steel plants,   following the failure of its main funder Greensill Capital. He has threatened to take legal action against banks that are   from his business interests. Jahama Highland Estates, formerly known as the Alcan Estate after its previous owner Rio Tinto’s aluminium business, boasts “the finest deer stalking ground in Great Britain” alongside hunting for grouse and ducks. Claiming to have “some of the toughest terrain in the UK”, including the north face of Ben Nevis, the estate was used for special forces training during the Second World War. GFG acquired the estate in 2016 as part of a taxpayer-guaranteed deal to buy a smelter and associated hydropower plant for £330m from Rio Tinto. The Scottish government provided a 25-year guarantee, worth an estimated £360m and underpinned by the taxpayers from across the UK, with the promise that up to 2,000 jobs would be created. An alloy wheel factory was planned and then shelved amid claims of a downturn in the car industry. The SNP forged ahead with the deal despite warnings by advisers to the businesses’ pension scheme trustees that it left UK taxpayers exposed to hundreds of millions of pounds of losses. Scotland’s rural economy minister Fergus Ewing last month repeated the claim that the taxpayer guarantee that underpinned Mr Gupta’s purchase of the Lochaber smelter prevented separation of the assets. He said: “Our support, which we offered to any bidder with plans for long-term industrial operations of the Lochaber businesses, prevented break-up of the assets.” The Gupta umbrella under which the former Alcan Estate is now held was in 2019 named as “the biggest property company you’ve never heard of” in the trade press alongside claims that in just two years of deal-making it became Britain’s fifth biggest land owner. The SNP came under pressure in February after a Labour MSP said GFG had not delivered on its commitment to hand part of the estate to locals. Scottish Conservative finance spokesman Murdo Fraser said: “These revelations add to a growing sense of unease around the terms of the deal struck by the SNP administration. “We need to know whether this generous taxpayer-funded support was conditional on assets being preserved, as the SNP minister has suggested. If there has been any suspected breach of the terms, he must take whatever steps are necessary to protect public funds.” Separately, High Court documents reveal that Mr Gupta, “his wife, his three children and two nannies” were forced out of a £100,000-a-month tenancy of a property in Eaton Square, Belgravia, last year after lenders claimed the owner of the property did not have permission to grant the tenancy. Soon after Mr Gupta acquired a mansion on another square nearby for £42m. A GFG spokesman said: “Jahama works closely with its partners in various parts of Scottish government. Jahama has been described as a beacon of inspiration for landscape-based asset management.”"

Labour accused of 'letting off anti-Semitism' after failing to expel members
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/04/labour-accused-letting-anti-semitism-failing-expel-members/,"Labour has been accused of ""letting off anti-Jewish racism"" after a complaints-handling handbook was published that gave examples of tolerating anti-Semitic behaviour. A 33-page copy of “The Labour Party’s Complaint Handling Handbook” posted online and obtained by The Telegraph gave examples of seven different complaints and set out how the party responded in each instance. The handbook gave just a single example of a member being expelled – although the example was not linked to remarks about Jews. It comes on the 12-month anniversary on Sunday of  . Last December Labour published a  in the party approved by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission. One case study in the handbook described how “a Labour Party member posted several articles on social media promoting conspiracy theories suggesting that Jewish people were responsible for real and imagined wrongdoings. They also posted articles that minimised complaints of anti-Semitism within the Labour Party.” The handbook said: “After investigation, it was concluded that no Labour Party rules were specifically breached but a Reminder of Conduct was issued to the member.” In another instance the handbook describes how “a Labour Party member posted online the details of an email they’d sent which presented emotive, personal views including that the Jewish Labour Movement and Labour for Israel groups had no validity and should be disbanded. They refused to retract those views.” It says: “After investigation, a formal warning was issued against the member and they were told it would remain on their record for 18 months. Following this, they resigned their membership.” In a third case “a Labour Party member posted and shared several things on social media that were anti-Semitic; using Hitler, Nazi and Holocaust metaphors, distortions and comparisons in debates about Israel-Palestine.” It continued: “After investigation, a formal warning was issued to the member and they were told it would remain on their record for 18 months.” In a fourth instance “a Labour Party member responded to a social media post in a way that served to repeat anti-Semitic tropes”. It said: “After investigation, it was concluded that no Labour Party rules had specifically been breached but a reminder of values was issued to the member.” The handbook gave just a single example of a member being expelled – although the example was not linked to remarks about Jews. It cited how “a Labour Party member posted on social media and responded to others’ posts demonstrating views that were xenophobic, anti-Catholic, transphobic and abusive. They also posted insulting and abusive comments about people with disabilities and victims of sexual abusive.” The handbook said: “The member was administratively suspended at the outset, and following investigation, was expelled.” Critics said Labour had to do more to tackle anti-Semitism. Lord Austin of Dudley, a former Labour MP and chairman of the anti-extremism campaign Mainstream, said: ""The new Labour leadership need to do much more to tackle Jeremy Corbyn’s terrible legacy. “The pace is too slow, there is much more to do and people with views like this can’t be tolerated. They have to be kicked out.” Euan Philipps, a spokesman for Labour Against Anti-Semitism, added: “The disciplinary measures applied to the four examples of anti-Semitic conduct are insufficient and fail to meet the benchmark of ‘zero tolerance’. “In our view all four examples should have resulted in expulsion. If they are indicative of the wider approach then they are very concerning, and it is difficult to see how this will lead to a long-term change of culture within the Labour Party. “In light of the EHRC findings about Labour anti-Semitism and the length of time Starmer has had to address the issue, letting anti-Jewish racism off with a warning shows that Labour’s new Complaint Handling Handbook is a step backwards.” Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: “These inappropriate comparisons to the Holocaust belittle the memory of this appalling tragedy and are an insult to the survivors and their families. It is about time this sort of thing is dealt with. A slap on the wrist will not do.” A Labour spokesman was approached for comment on the criticism of the handbook. In the introduction to the handbook, the party said: “We encourage people to report behaviour by our members that may constitute a breach of our rules or does not reflect our shared values. “We take all such reports seriously and look to investigate and resolve these matters in the most appropriate way.” A Labour Party spokesman said: “This handbook was published as part of the action plan we agreed with the EHRC. “The cases highlighted refer to previous decisions which do not reflect the current approach of zero tolerance to anti-Semitism. “Under Keir Starmer’s leadership, we are continually improving and strengthening procedures to root out antisemitism from our party.” Sources said that “the cases highlighted were examples of past decisions. They were used to illustrate how the process operated, as required by the EHRC, not as any form of recommended course of action. “We are working extremely closely with Jewish stakeholders and the EHRC to strengthen these processes. “The party has determined more cases in the period since Keir Starmer became leader than were determined throughout the entirety of 2019 or throughout the period of 2014-2018 combined.”"

David Cameron 'lobbied financial secretary to Treasury for Covid support'
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/03/david-cameron-lobbied-financial-secretary-treasury-covid-support/,"David Cameron lobbied another Conservative minister for access to coronavirus financial support, it was reported on Friday night. The former prime minister contacted Jesse Norman, financial secretary to the Treasury, as well as Rishi Sunak, the chancellor,   said. He was working for a senior advisor for Greensill at the time and was believed to have shared options worth up to $60 million (£44 million). Jesse Norman served as a policy advisor in Downing Street from 2013 and has been in the Commons since 2010. He is married to Kate Bingham, who chairs the Government's vaccine taskforce. It comes after reports the former prime minister lobbied former colleagues in Whitehall to try to help Greensill access government-backed emergency coronavirus loan schemes, just months before the lender collapsed into insolvency. Under legislation brought in by Mr Cameron while he was in Downing Street, anyone who directly lobbies ministers or senior officials on behalf of a third party in return for payment, must first sign up to the Government's official register of lobbyists. Failure to do so can lead to a £7,500 civil penalty or, in severe cases, criminal prosecution. Mr Cameron is alleged to have directly contacted the Treasury, including text messages to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Number 10 and the Bank of England, who also received approaches from Greensill.   The former prime minister was cleared last week of   following claims that he tried to persuade Government figures to grant loans to a financial firm he worked for. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Mr Norman.  Mr Cameron has been an adviser to the lender since 2018. In his role in the Treasury, Mr Norman was not responsible for Covid support schemes. Both Mr Cameron and Mr Norman were approached for comment by the Telegraph. Labour on Friday night told   that the latest revelation underlined the need for the Treasury to declare all contacts with Cameron. It comes following news that more than 60 ministers and special advisers who worked in Cameron’s government have moved into private sector jobs linked to their previous roles. The analysis by the   newspaper found that 66 aides and politicians received approval to take up roles with potential links to areas in which they developed policy, though there is no suggestion that any have broken any rules."

Kill the Bill protests see dispersal order issued in Bristol as dozens arrested at London march
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/04/kill-bill-protests-see-dispersal-order-issued-bristol-dozens/,"A dispersal order was issued by police early on Sunday morning after dozens of ‘Kill the Bill’ demonstrations took place across the UK. Avon and Somerset Police issued the section 35 dispersal order for Bristol city centre after more than 1,000 attended a protest  . The force said the order was issued after “a number of incidents involving violence between the remaining protesters”. Officers had previously closed off the M32 motorway after protesters sat on the road. A total of 107 arrests were made by the Metropolitan Police for offences including breaches of Covid legislation, violent disorder and assault on police. “While our advice to people remains not to attend large gatherings, the vast majority of people who attended central London yesterday, adhered to social distancing, and engaged and listened to my officers,” said Commander Ade Adelekan, who led the Met’s policing operation. “However, as the afternoon wore on it became clear that a small number of people were intent on remaining to cause disruption to law-abiding Londoners. “Despite repeated instructions from officers to leave, they did not and, amid increasing levels of disorder, arrests were made. “We should not allow the behaviour of a few individuals who attend these events with the purpose of committing criminal acts to taint the good behaviour of the majority who attended yesterday.” Ten officers are thought to have been injured, “none of [which] are believed to be serious”, the Met said this morning. The majority of protesters had dispersed by the time clashes took place between dozens of riot police and the remaining crowds. Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader,   against the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill outside London’s Parliament Square on Saturday afternoon. The Bill, which was voted through last month, will give police officers additional powers  and contains new measures increasing sentences for violent criminals and child killers. The legislation has caused controversy because it also permits police to control the length of protests, set maximum noise levels, and prosecute attendees who cause “serious annoyance”. It came under renewed scrutiny after the policing of a vigil in memory of Sarah Everard last month, which was perceived by some as ‘heavy-handed’. A previous ‘Kill the Bill’ demonstration in Bristol saw police vans torched and some officers injured. Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, condemned the riot as ""thuggery and disorder by a minority""."

Owen Paterson on the agony of his wife's suicide: 'It's horrifying to think she was suffering so badly without us knowing'
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/01/29/owen-paterson-agony-wifes-suicide-horrifying-think-suffering/,"When the police told Owen Paterson his wife Rose had been found   of their Shropshire home, his last desperate hope was that she had been murdered. “In some ways that would have been easier to process than suicide,” admits the former cabinet minister. “That is how terrible suicide is for those left behind. It is just so hard to comprehend how someone could be so desperate that they feel this is the only way out. “Here we are, seven months on, and it’s absolutely horrifying to think that Rose was also suffering so badly without us knowing. “I miss her so much, and so often find myself on the point of calling her, as if she is still with us. The fact that we’ll never speak again is nothing short of devastating.""  The pain is etched on the veteran politician’s face as he describes how he can no longer listen to the Mozart that was played at their 1980 wedding, or Cockney Rebel, the Steve Harley song that provided the soundtrack to their days together at the University of Cambridge in the Seventies. But it is seeing their 21-month-old granddaughter, Sylvie, that brings home the  , which affects 16 families in Britain every single day.  “Rose will never see her first daubed paintings, she will never go to her first school play. It's just so desperately sad.” Owen, who has been the MP for North Shropshire for 23 years, has decided to speak candidly about Rose’s death for the first time to a national newspaper in the hope that it will help others. “If I can help stop just one family from experiencing the utter agony we have gone through, then I will have done something worthwhile,” insists the former environment and Northern Ireland secretary. With his sons Felix, 34, Ned, 32 and daughter Evie, 28, Owen is poised to launch The Rose Paterson Trust, a charity dedicated to raising money for  , suicide bereavement and projects promoting mental and physical health. The Trust has recently been awarded charitable status and will be officially unveiled on the day of the Grand National on April 10, in honour of Rose, who was chairman of Aintree Racecourse.  The Grand National has always been a big day for the family, but this year they hope that it will enable them to do some real good in Rose’s memory. “Rose was such a kind and caring person by nature,” said Owen. “We know she would want us to help others. She did so much for charity herself. We just want to make her proud.” Owen had no idea that his beloved wife of 40 years was feeling suicidal in the days before she was found dead in the early hours of June 24, his 64th birthday. When she did not answer his telephone calls from the House of Commons on the morning she went missing, he did not think anything of it.  As well as her work with Aintree and as a Steward of the Jockey Club, Rose would often be out and about, too busy to respond to messages.  But when calls to their home near Ellesmere continued to go unanswered at 6pm that evening, Owen began to worry. “I wasn’t entirely surprised she hadn’t got back to me because she would often be out in the garden or at Aintree. “But she’d nearly always be back by the evening because she was very punctilious about keeping on top of emails.” After another couple of hours went by with no word from Rose, Ned, who was the last person to see her the previous evening, watching a TV documentary on Persian history, raised the alarm. By 8.15pm, Owen had called the police. “That’s when the whole nightmare began,” he recalls. As more and more neighbours joined the effort to find Rose, he jumped in the car with Felix, who lives in south London, and immediately drove to Shropshire. Throughout the 200-mile journey north, they were in constant communication with Ned.  “We went through everything over and over: heart attack, stroke, some respiratory collapse. Had she slipped and banged her head on a rock? Had a branch fallen on her head? We had all these crazy ideas. We never, ever thought of suicide.” Arriving home as a helicopter circled overhead, the lead police officer on the case walked straight up to Owen and asked him a question he will never forget. “Looking back, he knew exactly what he was looking for,” Owen concedes. “He said, ‘Mr Paterson, does your wife suffer from depression?’ Irritated, Owen dismissed the idea and stressed the urgency of finding his wife alive.  “I said: ‘Please, I'm really worried, it’s been a really hot June day, she'll be out there dehydrating’.” By then it was half past midnight. “We could see them with their torches working the wood very methodically. We did hear some shouting and then the shouting stopped.  “At around 4am, the Police called us into the kitchen and said they’d found a female body and the appearance conformed to Rose Paterson.” At that point Owen demanded that Rose’s body not be taken down until he had had the chance to see her for a final time. “I hoped it would be anything but suicide. But when I went down there, it was quite obvious that she’d killed herself.” He then had to break the horrendous news to the couple’s daughter, Evie, 28, who was on holiday in France, awaiting Rose’s arrival the following day. West Mercia police later informed the family that Rose had been searching suicide websites a fortnight before, at seven in the morning.  “People say, ‘Oh you mustn’t beat yourself up' but of course I beat myself up every single day,” said Owen. The timing, on his birthday, only added to the family’s sense of bewilderment. Rose had been planning to travel to London that day to see an aunt who had just come out of lockdown, before organising a birthday dinner for Owen and then travelling out to France. She was also chairing a virtual meeting at Aintree.     “All the papers are still on her desk,” said Owen. “I just can’t bear to move them. “What is utterly tragic is that Rose's career was really blossoming. She’d done wonderful work at Aintree on animal welfare and making it more inclusive to women and families. She was doing some terrific stuff for Park Palace Ponies, an inner-city riding school in Toxteth."" Although the inquest into Rose’s death in  , she had not been on any medication for several years. “The coroner answers the who, what, when, where, how questions but never the why,"" said Owen. ""We will never definitively know why.” The couple had been under some pressure since the last general election, following a number of press reports about Owen’s external consultancy work. There had also been criticism of the racing industry for allowing the  . Owen believes them both catching Covid-19 at the beginning of the first lockdown may have had an impact on Rose’s mental health. “Rose didn’t like being ill and with the family at home she rallied round and seemed to get better far sooner than I did. “But ongoing research into the virus shows that, while it has a bigger, physical effect on men, women are disproportionately affected neurologically. Some it seems have had mini strokes and others behavioural changes.” He also blames the suicide websites she secretly visited for “drawing her in”. “Many of these suicides are on impulse. The narrative these sites use is so beguiling and it's written in such calm language.  “Yet these sites never talk about the damage on those you leave behind.” Citing evidence which suggests every suicide affects 135 people, he adds: “I feel quite strongly that if she had known the utter catastrophe she's brought on herself and many people – not just immediate family – she wouldn’t have done it. “Every suicide is unnecessary. Every suicide is avoidable. “The utter tragedy of this is Rose – a wonderful woman who everyone loved so very much – has lost her life and our lives have been changed forever.” Owen’s first Christmas in more than four decades without Rose passed in a “blur” with him spending two freezing cold hours at her grave side at the family home.  “I just wanted to be next to her,"" he said. ""I played Schubert and Mahler and stuff that she loved.” The daughter of the 4th Viscount Ridley, who was brought up on the Blagdon Estate in Northumberland, Rose had a fierce intellect and an unparalleled knowledge of horses.  “I miss her brain,"" said Owen. ""I had a second brain. She was incredibly well read and she kept me up to date on stuff. I can already feel all my racing knowledge slipping away because she's not here.” Admitting he had no previous experience of suicide, he is now trying to educate himself to help others. “If one person reading this, just one person, thinks twice about taking their own life, then it will be worth it. “Society has this image of someone who is caricatured as depressed, whose life has gone badly wrong. Rose was anxious but I wouldn't say she was depressed. “So if anyone reading this knows someone who is anxious, then please just talk to them. You may well be saving their life."""

A year of coronavirus lockdown: How Boris Johnson's hospitalisation sparked a 'jostling for position' in No10
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/18/year-coronavirus-lockdown-boris-johnsons-hospitalisation-sparked/,"Ever since his   last year, debate has raged about the extent to which the experience changed Boris Johnson's approach to tackling the pandemic. His most loyal aides have always insisted it did not change him at all – but some allies now privately concede that he emerged from his hospital stay a different man. ""That whole near-death experience made him look at this through a different lens,"" said one. ""After he came out of hospital... he started talking about how we could lose more people to Covid than we lost in the Second World War."" Irrespective of the effect his illness had on him, Mr Johnson's   was almost certainly the closest Britain has come to losing a Prime Minister in office since Margaret Thatcher in 1984. Now, for the first time, some of those who were closest to the centre of power while Mr Johnson's life hung in the balance have spoken about both the moment they feared they might lose him and the Cabinet in-fighting his absence prompted. The Prime Minister was taken into hospital  . While he fought for his life, another battle was going on at the heart of Government. ""It became a bit of a power struggle between different ministers,” said one well-placed source. ""We were trying to keep team spirit together, but Michael [Gove] and Dom Raab were taking chunks out of each other. It was just awful. ""There was a lot of talk of how Dom was trying to consolidate power, Michael was trying to muscle in on various committees and there was just lots of this noise going on. ""The PM was the final decision-maker, meaning that while he was in hospital it all went to Raab – but Gove didn't like that at all."" Another senior source said: ""There was an element of Gove and Hancock auditioning to be PM. But Raab did an excellent job. He earned everyone's respect by standing in, but not trying to be PM."" Others disagree. “We all know that Gove can be like that but during that period he categorically wasn’t,” said one, before adding. “Admittedly, I can’t say it was all peace and harmony...there was a bit of unease from the usual suspects and Cabinet colleagues had conversations with members who were being a little bit snippy.” A Government source said the claims were ""total nonsense"" and that the Cabinet ""really rallied together"", with no tension between the ""quad"" of senior ministers in charge in Mr Johnson's absence. It was on the evening of Thursday, March 26 that Mr Johnson  , telling the nation he had ""mild symptoms"" but was continuing to lead the Government while self-isolating. ""He was working from Rishi Sunak's office because it is below the flat in Number 11 where he and Carrie [Symonds] live,"" recalled one member of his team. ""The only people allowed to see him face to face were Martin Reynolds, his principal private secretary, and Lee Cain, his director of communications. ""There is a study and a private office with a door in between, and Martin and Lee would go into the other room and speak to him through the open door.""  Ms Symonds, Mr Johnson's fiancee, was   because she was heavily pregnant. But as his mandatory one-week self-isolation period neared its end, he was getting worse, not better. ""It was obvious he was getting more ill,"" said a source close to him. ""He was doing video messages for Twitter but he was taking five or six goes to get it right, where he is normally a one-take guy. Whenever people told him to take it easy, he kept saying: 'Strong like bull, strong like bull.' Except he wasn't. One time he said that and he beat his chest, which triggered an uncontrollable coughing fit."" Mr Johnson was having to manage without his most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, who had   on March 27, the day after the Prime Minister had tested positive, and remained there until April 13 after suffering Covid-like symptoms. By the evening of Friday, April 3 staff were so concerned about Mr Johnson that a doctor was called, and on the Sunday that followed he called his key staff to tell them he was going into hospital. At the time Downing Street said it was a ""precautionary measure"" – but behind the scenes it was a different story. ""There was such a change in him,"" said one member of his team. ""He wasn't fully engaging in conversations and he was detached."" Officials checked with him that he wanted Mr Raab, the Foreign Secretary,   if he became incapacitated. He confirmed that Mr Raab was ""100 per cent"" his choice. Mr Johnson's blood oxygen levels had fallen dangerously low, and by the next day, Monday, April 6, ""the doctors were telling us it was looking pretty grisly"", one source said. Nominally at least, the Prime Minister remained in charge of the country, but at around 5.30pm that day, while Mr Raab was taking a turn to host the daily Downing Street press conference, the phone on the desk of Sir Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary, rang.  Sir Mark, who had been watching the press conference with his deputy Helen MacNamara, James Slack, the Prime Minister's official spokesman, and Mr Reynolds, answered the call, which was from St Thomas's Hospital. ""It was one of the two Nicks that rang,"" said a senior source [Dr Nick Price and Prof Nick Hart were in charge of Mr Johnson's care]. ""They said they were going to move him to intensive care. They said it was a ghastly situation because it was 50/50 whether he would need to go onto a ventilator, and if he did go onto a ventilator it was 50/50 whether he would survive."" In fact, the survival odds for Covid patients who were intubated were even lower than that at the time. Another source said: ""Undoubtedly that Monday evening was the lowest point. Going to bed that night was a scary time because you didn't know what you were going to wake up to the next day."" After the phone call from the hospital, ""things moved incredibly quickly"", one insider recalled. After Mr Raab finished his press conference he was called into Sir Mark's office and told he was going to have to take over. Mr Cain had finished his own period of self-isolation that afternoon and drove to Downing Street, where he became ""the Prime Minister's mouth in absentia"", as one official described it. The official said: ""There was a fear that the PM could die and everybody was determined to keep the ship moving on. A Cabinet call was arranged so everyone could be updated."" One person who was in Number 10 at the time said: ""It was surreal when we found out – it hit us like a freight train. There weren't many of us in Downing Street that day because a lot of people were working from home, so there wasn't much time to process it. We just had to get on with the job in hand."" Mr Raab was sent onto the airwaves to reassure the nation that the Prime Minister was ""in safe hands"". At St Thomas's, opposite Parliament on the other side of the Thames, Mr Johnson was  , as he later said himself. He recalled in an interview last May that ""the bloody indicators kept going in the wrong direction"" and that ""the doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong. They had a strategy to deal with a 'death of Stalin' type scenario. ""I was not in particularly brilliant shape, and I was aware there were contingency plans in place."" Back in Downing Street, staff avoided talking about what would happen if Mr Johnson died. ""They were pretty tough days,"" said one insider. ""We were trying to source PPE [personal protective equiopment] every morning. Meanwhile, the PM was getting a lot of oxygen and it was very scary for him. It wasn't until the Thursday that the messages from the hospital started to get more positive."" Along with Mr Raab, Mr Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, and Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor were the ministers at the forefront of running the country while Mr Johnson remained in hospital. One source said the balance between saving lives and saving the economy shifted when Mr Johnson was off sick. ""The debate started when the PM was in hospital,"" said the source. ""Sedwill was pro opening up. The two big political operators are the PM and the Chancellor and when the PM is away the officials gravitate towards the big beast who is left, who was the Chancellor."" Mr Raab was helped in Downing Street by Mr Reynolds, Mr Cain, Mr Slack and Isaac Levido, a pollster who had previously worked on the general election campaign and had been drafted in from the private sector to help out in the crisis. Mr Cain, a former tabloid journalist whose previous jobs famously included dressing in a chicken costume to taunt David Cameron during the 2010 election campaign, effectively stood in for Mr Johnson in key meetings by telling Mr Raab what the Prime Minister's thinking was on any given subject. ""Lee was cited on the papers that were being sent to Raab,"" said one source. ""He got every box that went to Raab, and in the same way that he would challenge things before they got to the PM, Lee did that for Raab. He was the intermediary."" Another source said: ""Lee was basically running the joint. Raab stepped in but Lee was very much running the Number 10 operation. He was in all of the key meetings with Raab, as the PM's right-hand man in the room, saying what the PM would have done. I can't recall anything on which he and Raab disagreed."" Mr Johnson was discharged from hospital on April 12, a week after he had been admitted, and  . Although no one knew it at the time, it was the same day as Mr Cummings was making   to ""test his eyesight"" before returning to London the next day. At Chequers, Mr Johnson was soon resuming work calls with, among others, the Queen and the then-US president, Donald Trump. Mr Trump  : ""He sounded incredible, he was ready to go – it's like the old Boris, tremendous energy, tremendous drive."" Mr Cummings, meanwhile, was becoming ever more evangelical about the benefits of lockdown. ""He had always been in favour of lockdown, and argued for doing it earlier than we did,"" said one former colleague. ""While he was off sick he read loads of stuff about pandemics and came back telling everyone that the countries that did best were the ones that locked down early and didn't unlock too soon. He said those countries lost fewer people and took a smaller hit to their economies."" Mr Johnson  , ""probably a week too early"", one aide now admits, and told the nation there were ""real signs now that we are passing through the peak"" of the virus. Two days later, his son Wilfred was born. So what effect did the Prime Minister’s darkest hour have on him?  “I do think it changed him,” said one friend of the Prime Minister. “He had been very hesitant about putting the country into lockdown, but after he came out of hospital it’s all been about protecting lives. “He started talking about how we could lose more people to Covid than we lost in the Second World War.” ""He was pretty determined before he went into hospital, and he was pretty determined when he came out,"" said one. ""The one obvious change was that he started talking a lot about how we were too fat as a country and  ."" Britain has already lost more people to the virus than died in the Blitz, but the war cost 450,000 British lives in total, or 0.94 per cent of the population, including 383,000 in the Armed Forces. To date, Covid has taken 125,000 lives, or around 0.2 per cent of the population. Those most loyal to Mr Johnson continue to hold to the official line that the events of last April made no difference to his policies. ""He was pretty determined before he went into hospital, and he was pretty determined when he came out,"" said one. ""The one obvious change was that he started talking a lot about how we were too fat as a country and  ."" Another Johnson loyalist said: “It didn’t change him at all. Both before and after he went into hospital he kept saying it was important the cure wasn’t worse than the virus.”"

Why Ursula von der Leyen won't quit over AstraZeneca vaccine row
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/02/02/ursula-von-der-leyen-wont-quit-astrazeneca-vaccine-row/,"Ursula von der Leyen has no plans to quit after last week’s coronavirus vaccine fiasco, despite suffering the worst week of her career as president of the European Commission.  Today she  for the vaccine fiasco and instead urged Europeans to judge her in three years time at the end of her term in office.  She is facing unprecedented criticism across the EU after her gaffe-strewn handling of the row with AstraZeneca.  Brussels’ threat to  , and the slow roll-out of vaccinations across the bloc have increased the pressure on the former German defence minister.  As far as Mrs von der Leyen, who has   commissioner and is accused of centralising all power in her small circle of trusted advisors, is concerned she is going nowhere.  In truth, there is little political appetite in the European Parliament, which can remove a commission president, or in EU capitals for Mrs von der Leyen to go.  The European Commission is playing an important role in the procurement of vaccines and the coordination of coronavirus measures among the member states.  Defenestrating its president now, with the pandemic raging and a massive economic stimulus package to be rolled out, is still seen as self-defeating.  It would trigger a long process to replace her and, possibly the whole college of commissioner, which would cost valuable time.  There is no ready made replacement waiting in the wings and, even if they had the power to force her out, member states were responsible for appointing her in the first place and won’t want to publicise their error. A fragmented European Parliament approved Mrs von der Leyen with a majority of just nine votes and the fiasco has cost her some support, which could impact her ability to get EU law passed.  It is true that those EU governments less enamoured of Brussels overreach would welcome having a lame duck commission president in place.  Both EU governments and the European Parliament will also be keen to avoid a clash over the method used to choose the president.  EU leaders, led by Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, ditched the Spitzenkandidat system, which tied the results of the European elections to the top job. Much to the fury of the European Parliament, they returned to the summit stitch-ups that had chosen all commission presidents except Jean-Claude Juncker.  Promises were made to return to the failed experiment in democracy in the future, which even the frequently supine MEPs would insist upon if Mrs von der Leyen was to go.  Any British politician who faced  would be expected to at least consider their position or quit, as Theresa May did.  Resignations in response to failure have sadly fallen out of fashion in Westminster but have rarely been à la mode in Brussels, the de facto capital of the European Union.  The sole president of the European Commission to fall on his sword was Jacques Santer, who resigned in 1999 before he was removed by MEPs amid a corruption scandal  Jean-Claude Juncker stayed resolutely in post when the beginning of his presidency was engulfed by the Luxleaks scandal, which exposed his role in Luxembourg’s sweetheart tax deals with multinationals.  To British observers it may appear incredible that Mrs von der Leyen will survive her botched handling of the pandemic.  But while Europe’s capitals, grateful for a scapegoat for their own national failings in the pandemic, are more than happy to drag her over the coals, there is no political appetite to replace her. ""In this crisis the commission saw a chance for itself to act as a government but governments sometimes step down when things go wrong or at least are held accountable by their parliaments,"" one EU diplomat said.  ""Having said that, member states have allowed them to do this because they are too busy managing their own crisis."""

EU has a loaded gun on the negotiating table, but it won't pull the trigger
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/26/eu-still-has-gun-table-wont-pull-trigger/,"European Union leaders have left the gun of a vaccine export ban on the negotiating table with Britain but they don’t want to pull the trigger in case they shoot themselves in the collective foot.  The heads of state and government of the remaining 27 member states held a video summit on Thursday night to discuss stricter export controls on coronavirus vaccines.  , a slow vaccination rate and huge shortfalls of supplies of the AstraZeneca jab. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president,  , which allows Brussels to stop exports to countries, like the UK, with higher vaccination rates than the EU and low exports to it. France, Spain and Italy wanted the biggest stick to wave at Britain possible, while Germany, Belgium, Ireland, and the Netherlands were worried about triggering a vaccine trade war.  Britain exports raw materials to the Pfizer factory in EU member Belgium, which could be at risk if the EU blocked vaccine supplies to the UK.  The European Council was too divided to agree to explicitly support the new rules in their summit conclusions.  This makes little difference legally because the rules had already entered into force through a commission implementing regulation. It could be quashed by EU member states over the next fortnight but it won’t be. It is politically significant. Mrs von der Leyen (below) will think twice without the support of her masters in the Council and they have made clear she is not to put supply chains at risk.  Mark Rutte of the Netherlands said he hoped the new rules would never be used.  The gun on the table may not have a full chamber but it is still loaded.  AstraZeneca, which Brussels accuses of breaking its supply contract with the EU, and by extension Britain is not off the hook.  Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Mrs von der Leyen were clear.  “Companies have to honour their contract to the European Union before they export to other regions in the world. And this is of course the case with AstraZeneca,” said Mrs von der Leyen, before adding the firm would have to “catch up” before it could export outside the EU. The commission has already threatened to block shipments of the Oxford University jab to the UK from AstraZeneca’s Halix plant in the Netherlands.  It wants Boris Johnson to drop the British first refusal on jabs manufactured in the two UK AstraZeneca plants so they can begin supplying the EU, which is foreseen in Brussels’ contract with the pharma giant.  Brussels says this is a matter of fairness because EU-based factories have exported so many vaccines to the UK. UK-EU negotiations are underway and will continue in the coming days.  The EU’s gun may not be quite as large as Mrs von der Leyen would have liked but it could still blow a hole in Britain’s vaccination rollout.  The commission has briefed member states that Britain is hugely dependent on EU supplies for the second phase of its vaccination programme.  Since December, Pfizer has sent the UK 20m doses. A further 1m came from AstraZeneca.  Just under 29m people have had their first jab in Britain. That suggests about 8m jabs in the UK were made in Britain or imported from suppliers outside the EU, which is by no means enough to fill a continental sized hole in imports.  The UK will struggle to vaccinate the rest of its population  , ensuring they are fully vaccinated, without EU supplies.  About 2.5m are fully vaccinated with a second dose, leaving about 26m people at risk of not being fully inoculated against coronavirus.  France’s foreign minister held up the EU’s gun this morning. He said the UK’s first dose policy, in which as many people were jabbed as quickly as possible meant there were no stockpiles reserved for second shots.  Jean-Yves Le Drian, France's foreign minister, said “Europe does not have to pay the price for this policy.” The UK-EU talks are the first since Britain left the transition period to not directly concern Brexit.  EU leaders have made clear their preference is for a deal rather than a trade war.  Unless the UK has a secret second shot stockpile stashed away somewhere, Boris Johnson may be forced to to find the least embarrassing way to give the EU what it wants.  That is likely to be an agreement to share supplies from the Halix factory and possibly, at a later date, from the two British-based factories as well.  That compromise will be far simpler to swallow once more and more people are vaccinated and more supplies come on stream in the coming months."

Special report: Sturgeon clings to tarnished crown after inquiries ‘lift lid on the sewer’ of SNP politics
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/26/special-report-sturgeon-clings-tarnished-crown-inquiries-lift/,"“It’s very clear that Nicola Sturgeon is damaged goods and her days are numbered. She is by no means off the hook.” The sort of verdict you might expect from a flag-waving Unionist at the end of a tempestuous week for the Scottish National Party. Except that those words were spoken by a former deputy leader of the SNP itself, even before Alex Salmond’s The jubilation among the First Minister’s supporters after she survived two inquiries into her role in the Alex Salmond affair lasted all of three days before Mr Salmond pulled back the tarpaulin on his ultimate vengeance weapon, the Alba Party, which threatens to blow up the SNP’s chances of a Holyrood majority in the May 6 elections. If the SNP – currently a minority government – achieves an overall majority, the party’s plans to force a second independence referendum will be rapidly accelerated. There is a growing belief within the SNP, however, that the party will fall short of the mark, and that if “IndyRef2” does happen, it might not be with Ms Sturgeon at the helm. The SNP’s poll rating peaked at 58 per cent last autumn, and stayed above 50 per cent for the whole of last year, putting the party on course for a majority,   according to a recent Opinium poll, suggesting the controversy has taken its toll. The twin inquiries into the SNP’s handling of sexual misconduct allegations made against former leader Mr Salmond have exposed to public view the toxic civil war between the Sturgeonites and the Salmondites, like a manhole cover being lifted off a sewer. Mr Salmond now intends to go another round with Ms Sturgeon in a fresh court case that could reveal damaging details suppressed in the inquiries. Then, at 2pm on Friday, came that Mr Salmond is to lead a new party into the elections. Its aim, he claims, is to achieve a “supermajority” for independence in the Scottish parliament, but its effect is more likely to be splitting the vote between the SNP and Alba (the Scottish Gaelic name for Scotland). Mr Salmond said on Friday that Alba was “planting our saltire on a hill” and that “in the next few weeks we shall see how many will rally to our standard”. In truth, he is parking his tanks on Ms Sturgeon’s lawn, driving a wedge into the split that already exists in the SNP, and calling on its members, MPs and MSPs to defect to his side. If he is elected to Holyrood, it will be the start of an all-out war between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond for the leadership, and the future, of Scotland.   Jim Sillars, the former deputy leader of the SNP, said: “I was a long-term critic of Alex Salmond when he led the SNP, and he of me. I take back not a word, and I expect him to be the same. “But Brexit, the pandemic, the failures of the SNP, the embarrassing stark lack of quality in its ranks in Holyrood, means we are in a new situation when old grievances need to be set aside. I welcome his return to frontline politics.” He added: “People have seen a face of the Scottish government that is unacceptable. People are not stupid. They know the government has misbehaved and engaged in a gross misuse of power. “This government is politically corrupt and the tentacles of political corruption have spread to institutions in civic society.” One serving SNP MP admitted: “Nicola’s brand has been tarnished. I think this will have an impact at the polls because people have seen the in-fighting and the rage.” For those who have not followed the labyrinthine progress of the Salmond affair, the basic facts are these: in 2018, details were leaked to a Scottish newspaper of sexual misconduct allegations against Mr Salmond, dating to 2013 when he was first minister. Mr Salmond denied the claims, accused the Scottish government of an abuse of process in its handling of the claims, and won a 2019 court case against the government, which had to pay him more than £500,000 for legal expenses. Weeks after winning the court case, Mr Salmond was charged by police with sexually assaulting nine women while he was first minister. He was cleared of 12 charges at a trial last year, the jury finding the 13th charge “not proven”. Mr Salmond accused members of the Sturgeon administration of by encouraging women to make complaints against him, which the SNP has always denied. He claimed Ms Sturgeon had known about the allegations for longer than she had admitted, and had lied to the Scottish Parliament about when she found out, a resignation matter if true. An independent inquiry by Irish barrister James Hamilton  though a committee of MSPs found  At the heart of the problem with Scottish politics is what Mr Sillars terms a “cult of personality” that began with Mr Salmond and was continued by Ms Sturgeon when she took over as SNP leader following defeat for the independence campaign in 2014’s “once in a generation” referendum. The SNP has not had a leadership election since 2004, such has been the dominance of Salmond and his former protege, but as one long-standing SNP member complained: “Any political party should be much bigger than one figure, because people always turn out to have feet of clay.” A cult is the opposite of a democracy, and the charge sheet of undemocratic behaviour by the SNP is growing. The party’s opponents cite the role of the Crown Office, the equivalent of England’s Crown Prosecution Service, which was able to  – over the two inquiries. In most democracies, the principle of the separation of powers means that prosecutors and politicians operate independently, as with England’s director of public prosecutions. But in Scotland, the Crown Office is headed by the Lord Advocate, who is also a member of the Cabinet, meaning the person who ultimately decides who does and does not face prosecution is a politician loyal to Ms Sturgeon (currently James Wolffe). As the former Brexit secretary “that leaves him conflicted and compromised, with his department’s independence undermined”. When the two inquiries’ reports were published this week, large sections were redacted on the orders of the Crown Office; Mr Hamilton himself complained that the redactions meant his own report “presents an incomplete and even at times misleading version of what happened”. Evidence given by Mr Salmond was redacted to protect the identities of complainants, according to the Crown Office, but Mr Davis, and others, have claimed the redactions did not identify the women and were designed only to protect Ms Sturgeon. Meanwhile, the somewhat toothless committee of MSPs which carried out the parliamentary inquiry complained that key evidence it requested from the Scottish government arrived with widespread redactions, with some documents “almost completely blank” and others with “pages and pages of fully redacted text”. The committee complained: “We did not know the basis on which redactions were being made.” Mr Salmond, ominously for Ms Sturgeon, has a plan to get that evidence out in the open. On Wednesday, he announced his intention to sue the Scottish government’s Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom he blamed for “catastrophic failures in this matter”. He pointed out that the courts would have “all the proper powers of recovery of documents” which the parliamentary committee lacked, and friends of Mr Salmond have confirmed that he believes those documents will implicate Ms Sturgeon’s office in what he sees as a conspiracy against him. He has also made a complaint to Police Scotland about the leaking of a story about the complaints against him in 2018, which could further embarrass the SNP if it proves to have come from someone close to Ms Sturgeon. “This could go on for a long time and could yet bring Nicola down,” admitted a senior SNP source. Amid the fevered anticipation of the inquiry reports, another potential time-bomb for Ms Sturgeon went largely unnoticed last weekend. Three members of the SNP’s Finance and Audit Committee resigned, reportedly because they had been denied full access to the party’s books by SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, also known as the husband of Nicola Sturgeon. One of the departees, Cynthia Guthrie, was announced yesterday as an Alba Party candidate. The SNP has not reported or even confirmed the resignations, let alone the reasons for them, and party sources have told The Telegraph they are “having a hard time” getting to the bottom of the matter. Questions about management of the SNP’s finances are not new: the party raised £600,000 for a second referendum campaign which it claimed was “ringfenced”, but only had £97,000 in the bank in its most recent accounts, and members now report being asked for more donations for a referendum “fighting fund”. A spokesman for the SNP said three people had resigned from its finance and audit committee following concerns about leaks to the media, and denied Mr Murrell had failed to provide access to the accounts.  It said the £600,000 raised for a referendum “is allocated to our 2021 budget and will be spent in this financial year”. Despite the whiff of scandal that has hung over Auld Reekie for the past three years, relatively few public figures have dared to speak out against the SNP, such is   its power and electoral dominance have engendered north of the border. Jack Perry CBE, the former chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, the national innovation and investment agency, has witnessed it at first hand. “The SNP party machine is good at intimidation,” he said. “It’s implicit that if you oppose them or offend them, you won’t get much business in the future. I have been at business events where every single firm is anti-independence but when an SNP minister turns up not a single person challenges them because they are afraid to.” Glasgow-based Barrhead Travel from nationalists when it backed the No campaign in the independence referendum.  when it branded its teacakes “British” rather than Scottish south of the border. Other businesses have learnt to keep quiet for fear of a fight with the so-called “cybernats” who launch attacks via social media. Earlier this week, it emerged that former Manchester United football manager Sir Alex Ferguson, not normally regarded as a shrinking violet,  in the 2014 referendum because “the people putting their heads above the parapet were getting shot at”, according to Alistair Campbell’s latest diaries. Sir Alex feared “dog’s abuse” for standing up for the Union, in which he is a passionate believer. Scots rely far more heavily on their government for employment than the English: the public sector accounts for 21.8 per cent of jobs in Scotland, compared with 16.4 per cent in England, meaning “a lot of private companies are reliant on public sector contracts”, Mr Perry said. He added that quangos which were once headed by independent-minded patrons ready to challenge the government and improve policy were now all too often populated with unquestioning SNP supporters. Even the education of Scotland’s children is up for grabs when it comes to promoting the nationalist cause, critics say. In December, Education Scotland finally withdrew a timeline of Scottish history after Sir Tom Devine, the country’s leading historian, Among its false claims was that Sir Winston Churchill “dispatched English troops and tanks” to stamp out a major protest by striking workers in Glasgow in 1919 while locking up Scottish soldiers in barracks. Other errors included a suggestion that Flower of Scotland – written in the 1960s – dated as far back as the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Academics had raised the alarm almost two years before the timeline – “clearly designed in the cause of Scottish independence”, according to one history professor – was eventually removed. Nor is the supposedly politically neutral civil service immune from the SNP’s iron grip. A taxpayer-funded Scottish Government video released at new year described the Brexit trade deal as “a bad deal for Scotland” that would cause “greater risk to national security”, prompting accusations that the civil service was While the SNP is ruthless in targeting its opponents, it reserves its most sinister threats for those within its ranks.  Joanna Cherry, the SNP MP for Edinburgh South West, was  last month following a row over transgender law reform (Ms Cherry QC believes the SNP is going too far in simplifying the legal process for changing gender). She later revealed she had been subjected to “an 18-month campaign of abuse” culminating with “a threat of corrective rape from a party member”. Other SNP members had bombarded her with abuse, calling her a **** , while friends said she had been subjected to “bullying, lies and smears” from her colleagues. “It has become an anti-free speech party,” said one Sturgeon critic within the SNP. “Anyone who dares to depart from the party line and suggest new ideas is pretty much crushed.” Fraser Nelson, the editor of The Spectator and a proud Scot, has also faced apparent attempts to intimidate him after his magazine went to court to fight for the right to publish Alex Salmond’s evidence in full (opposed, inevitably, by the Crown Office). Trisha Marwick, the former presiding officer (Speaker) of the Scottish Parliament tweeted: “We see you Fraser,” with sinister overtones of “we know where you live”. Douglas Ross, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said: ""Sturgeon is clearly suffering from hubris. She is not out of the woods. Neither she nor any other person has been held to account for this litany of scandals. “Most people are rightly repulsed by this unedifying feud and her scorched earth approach has undermined public faith in Scotland's parliament.” As a senior member of the SNP told The Telegraph: “If I didn’t depend on the SNP for my employment, I would have cut up my membership card by now.” A recent survey found that only 8 per cent of Scots rank independence as one of the top three most important issues ahead of the May elections, with Covid recovery, jobs and healthcare their more pressing concerns. For Ms Sturgeon, independence is a useful megaphone to drown out any discussion of her failures, which are numerous. Under her watch educational attainment is down; drug-related deaths have more than doubled (to three and a half times the rate for England, and by far the worst in Europe); life expectancy has decreased in some areas, and even before Covid, Scotland was running a   than the rest of the UK. The SNP also has no answers to key questions around what an independent Scotland would look like –   whether it would have its own armed forces, how it would pay its way without its current subsidies from Westminster – with one SNP MP blaming “intellectual laziness” within the party for its failure to come up with a plan. Despite such failings, after 14 years in power, the SNP seems certain to be the largest party yet again on May 6, either with a majority (for which just four more seats out of 129 are needed) or as a minority government backed by the pro-independence Greens. It will leave the SNP defying political gravity by retaining power for at least 18 years by the time of the 2025 election, a record matched only by the Conservatives during the Thatcher and Major era. What then? Ironically, the issue of independence is likely to present a threat to Ms Sturgeon from within her party. She will face significant pressure from the radical wing of her party to call an indicative referendum straight away (which would not be legally binding without consent from Westminster), capitalising on Boris Johnson’s unpopularity in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon, however, is by nature more cautious, preferring to build support for independence until the polls suggest a virtually guaranteed win, which at the moment they do not. Were Ms Sturgeon to succumb to activists’ wishes for a quick referendum but fail to win it, she would lose not only the leadership, but very possibly her hopes of breaking up the Union for decades to come. Whether she even gets to make that choice could yet be in the hands of Mr Salmond."

Exclusive: Britain to tell Brussels AstraZeneca jab would not exist without UK investment
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/27/exclusive-britain-tell-brussels-astrazeneca-jab-would-not-exist/,"Britain will this week tell the European Union that it must take into account the millions of pounds spent by British taxpayers on creating the AstraZeneca vaccine as   remains. Talks to break the stand-off over jabs  , will resume as early as Monday.   The European Commission has threatened to   because British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has fallen far short of its contracted deliveries to the bloc.   Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, last week   after she disclosed that factories in the EU had sent 21 million jabs to the UK since December but received none in return.   The UK-EU negotiations will focus on defining what ""reciprocity"" means, whether it would include finished vaccines or their ingredients and whether and how a deal would take into account investment in vaccine development.   British officials will argue that the EU has benefited from £84 million in funding for the manufacturing for the AstraZeneca jab, developed by scientists at the University of Oxford. Without this cash, the UK will say, there would be no vaccine at all.   The UK is pushing for Britain's per capita investment to be part of the calculations because it is a single country rather than the 27 member states of the bloc and so has proportionately invested more than some individual EU nations. According to the Government's recent spending review, it has paid more than £6 billion in total to develop and procure Covid vaccines.   The UK also exports raw materials to the Pfizer vaccine plant in Belgium. It plans significant increases in research and development, with almost £15 billion in 2021-22 including funding for clinical research to support delivery of new drugs, treatments and vaccines. Maros Sefcovic, the commission vice-president, told The Telegraph that investment in development would be one of the factors taken into consideration when evaluating reciprocity. The commission does not see reciprocity as being based on a simple dose-for-dose formula, not least because it is a major manufacturing hub for the jab. One diplomat said he was not surprised by the British demand, saying it ""seemed fair"". But the source warned that the EU would also want German investment in the development of the Pfizer jab to be taken into account.  ""And how do we subtract the European investment in Halix? And the advance purchase agreement of the EU for the production of AstraZeneca vaccines that never came about?"" the diplomat said."

EU's 'most embarrassing' day: How the AstraZeneca vaccine factory raid unravelled
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/24/eus-embarrassing-day-story-behind-vaccine-factory-raid-unravelled/,"It was an extraordinary story – the European Commission   to find AstraZeneca's secret stockpile of vaccines reserved for Britain. During a surprise raid over the weekend, an elite unit of Italian military police acting on EU orders  . The discovery appeared to confirm the EU's long-held suspicion that AstraZeneca was giving the UK special treatment, secretly exporting doses to its home country while failing to deliver on contracts agreed with Brussels. Yet, as EU officials  , the allegation, briefed to the Continental press, simply wasn't true. In fact, most of the doses discovered in the Italian factory were destined for the EU itself, with the remainder headed for poorer countries across the world. One former Europe minister called it possibly the ""most embarrassing day in the EU's history"". Italy's La Stampa newspaper reported that Italian officers had  , where doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine are put into vials and labelled. The raid was carried out by the NAS, an elite unit of the Carabinieri which is part of the armed forces and usually investigates criminal syndicates suspected of counterfeiting food, wine and medicines. After inspecting the company's records, the officers   – roughly half AstraZeneca's delivery shortfall to the EU. EU sources briefed the newspaper that the shipment was thought to be secretly bound for the UK, despite the company having fallen far short of its promised deliveries to the bloc.  Italian authorities ordered the raid after Thierry Breton, the EU's commissioner for the internal market, raised suspicions during a visit to an AstraZeneca factory in Leiden, the Netherlands, earlier this month.  The commission issued the alert after Mr Breton suggested the numbers provided by AstraZeneca executives did not add up, suggesting a discrepancy between the reported overall supply and the number of doses reported by individual AstraZeneca factories. The raid came weeks after the Italian government   from the same factory under the EU's new export ban rules. The explosive news of a ""hidden"" bumper cache of jabs destined for the UK was quickly picked up by newspapers across the Continent. By mid-morning, however, the story began to unravel. British Government officials quickly insisted that supplies from the Catalent factory ""haven't been coming to the UK and we are not expecting anything from there"". Mario Gargiulo, the president of European biologics for Catalent, said the inspection by the Carabinieri had found ""everything in order"". Soon afterwards,  officials in Brussels admitted that the 29 million doses were in fact destined for AstraZeneca's plant in Belgium for onward distribution around the EU. An Italian government official said: ""On Saturday, the European Commission asked the prime minister to verify several consignments of vaccine in a production plant in Anagni. ""The Prime Minister informed the minister of health, Roberto Speranza, who arranged for the inspection to be carried out between Saturday and Sunday by the Carabinieri NAS. It emerged that the inspected batches were destined for Belgium. All outgoing batches were inspected."" AstraZeneca later said 16 million of the doses were ""waiting for quality control release to be dispatched to Europe"", while the other 13 million were to go to countries in the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme for developing countries. A spokesman said there were ""no exports currently planned other than to Covax countries"", adding that it was ""incorrect to describe this as a stockpile"". ""The process of manufacturing vaccines is very complex and time-consuming. In particular, vaccine doses must wait for quality control clearance after the filling of vials is completed,"" the spokesman said. Mr Breton later told the BBC that he had asked for the raid to ensure everything was on track and it had been ""helpful to understand what was happening in Italy"". But Bruno Maçães, Portugal's former Europe minister, called it possibly ""the most embarrassing day in EU history"". ""So Italian police raids a vaccine factory at suggestion of commission to find out these are vaccines for a global initiative aimed at providing equitable access to vaccines for some of the world's poorest regions? I think we're going to need an explanation of why Italian military police burst into a vaccine factory on false grounds,"" he added. However some EU officials were refusing to give up on Wednesday night, revealing that the commission had asked AstraZeneca for additional information about where the active ingredient in the vaccine vials found in Italy had been manufactured. Brussels sources indicated that the commission suspects that some of the drug substance sent to the Italian plant for packaging could have been produced in the much-scrutinised Halix plant in the Netherlands. So far the plant has not delivered vaccine doses to the EU because it does not have authorisation from European Medicines Agency. Member state officials have questioned why the approval process has not yet been completed, while the company has insisted it is ""on track"".  On Wednesday, AstraZeneca would only say that the vaccine doses had been brought from ""outside the EU"" to be packaged at the Italian plant. Other EU officials cast doubt over the doses reported by AstraZeneca to be destined for the Covax scheme, which the EU has exempted from any export bans. One told the Financial Times of suspicions that shipments ""go to some Covax countries to then be redirected to richer countries"". However, Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU's trade commissioner, was unequivocal and said the bloc would not impose any export restrictions on Covax, which plans to distribute two billion doses to poorer and middle income countries before the end of the year."
,politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/02/national-trust-trapped-hostility-britains-heritage-now-way/,"In happier times, this Easter weekend would see hundreds of thousands of people visiting the houses, gardens and open spaces of the National Trust, English Heritage and others. Sadly, Covid-19 still prevents most such visits.  Proper reopening is expected in May. To relaunch, Hilary McGrady, director-general of the National Trust, recently talked to Jeremy Paxman on his Covidically-titled podcast, “The Lock In”. She was trying to repair the damage done to the Trust’s reputation by its ventures last summer. A leaked policy document assailed the “outdated mansion experience” (ie the tradition of looking after beautiful country houses). The Trust’s “interim report” on its properties’ links with “slavery and colonialism” provoked outrage at its partiality and inaccuracy.  Ms McGrady defended the report but did admit to bad timing. “I wasn’t focused on it,” she told Paxman. Covid forced her to wrestle with falling membership and to get rid of staff. The report got “conflated” with Black Lives Matter (BLM). She had been under “massive pressure to get it out” and had lacked “the bandwidth” to handle it properly. She half-admitted that some of the report’s findings on the 93 properties singled out (mostly for attack) were sloppy, with slave or colonial connections “so tangential” as to be beside the point.  What Ms McGrady says is true. But she dismisses the idea that the report was politically motivated as “absolute nonsense”. If that is what she thinks – and I presume she does, since she seems an honest person – she has no idea what is going on, and why so many Trust members are distressed.  The Trust’s chairman, Tim Parker, is similarly ill-informed. When challenged by members about Black Lives Matter, he said that BLM is “a human rights movement, with no party political affiliations”. The fact that it is not party political is irrelevant. BLM is deeply, wholly political – dedicated to the overthrow of capitalism and the nuclear family, “defunding” the police and blaming all the ills of ethnic minorities on the innate wickedness of white people. Its name states a truism, but its purpose is to wreck our national heritage, since it sees that heritage as inherently evil – the opposite purpose to that on which the National Trust is based.  Ms McGrady should ask herself why there was such a rush to publish the slavery and colonialism report. A vast, long-established conservation charity with serious, statutory duties should never hurry a work of historical scholarship, especially not in a plague year. What need of an “interim” anything? It should take pains to get it right. But if the Trust had taken such pains, the report would not have served the political purpose of the key people who edited and wrote it, which was to be part of the BLM ambush of British institutions following the shocking killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last May. Universities, corporations, Whitehall departments, the BBC, all “took the knee” to the BLM doctrines. Sir Keir Starmer and many footballers literally did so. The head curator of the National Trust, Dr Sally-Anne Huxtable, the report’s co-editor, tweeted: “For me, now is a transformational time for the whole of society, and that includes the Trust.” That was a clearly political statement. I notice that Dr Huxtable no longer tweets, but she remains in post.  Professor Corinne Fowler, of the University of Leicester, is Dr Huxtable’s co-editor. She is also in charge of the Colonial Countryside Project – “child-led” but “historian steered” – which is actively supported by the Trust. The “historians” (though, by the way, Prof Fowler is not a historian) steer primary school children to attack the former owners of National Trust properties.  On the Trust’s website about Penrhyn Castle, a young boy writes that its objects, such as a stuffed bird, are “dark, unpleasant and brutal”: “they come from cruelty”. At Kedleston Hall, former home of Lord Curzon, one of the greatest benefactors of the National Trust and of built heritage conservation in India when viceroy, a young girl contributes a poem about him: “He thinks he’s strong,/trying to take over India./Although this was successful,/he still didn’t have any believers./Trying to look posh by ill-treating animals,/ for some reason, this makes him popular/ with the British.”  Needless to say, there are no primary school poems at Chartwell  . No blame, of course, should attach to the child poets: they are merely doing what their teachers expect of them.  also protests, like Hilary McGrady, against the idea that her project and report are politicised. Politicians should not “weaponise history”, she says. She happily does it herself, however. She is on record for attacking Brexit as the rebirth of imperialism. She says that British institutions and philanthropy etc bear a relation to empire not benevolently, but as “an exercise of profit and extraction”. She is entitled to her point of view, and anyone who denies the exploitative power of any empire has little understanding of human nature, but Prof Fowler appears to be on a political mission, not a scrupulous academic one. Looking at her Twitter account in the past week alone, I see she endorses an attack on several British monarchs for their involvement in slavery and retweets numerous assaults on the new Government report by Dr Tony Sewell on race and ethnic disparities. One of the tweets she supported accuses the Government of “actively fuelling” racism.  None of the above has been publicly rebuked by the National Trust bosses. I think this is because they half-accept it. The Trust’s own declarations online, called “Our cause” and “Who we are and what we stand for”, proclaim “our renewed commitment to diversity and inclusion and playing our part to create a fair, equal society, free from discrimination”. Fine perhaps, although words like “diversity” are often shields behind which organisations like BLM advance. But it is striking that these statements of intent do not mention the words “houses” or “gardens”. The Trust’s heritage purpose on behalf of the British public is its raison d’être, yet it is being hijacked by people with political, not heritage, motives – sometimes explicitly anti-British ones.   I am glad that Professor Fowler draws attention to the Sewell report. It is an important document, produced by a mostly ethnic-minority commission. It provides a counter-narrative to the idea that this country is “institutionally” and irredeemably racist, and analyses the data much more variously, trying to learn from numerous British ethnic-minority successes rather than heaping abuse on whiteness. The report’s publication now suggests that the BLM frenzy of last year is fading. The National Trust, of all bodies, should see that it is caught up in madness, and must get out of it. I am also glad that, as reported elsewhere in this paper today, National Trust members are now trying to drive a return to proper standards. For many months, members have inundated me – and, more importantly, Ms McGrady – with emails and letters protesting about what is going on, but they have lacked a rallying point. An organisation called Restore Trust has started quietly online. Its aims, expressed with reverence for the Trust’s past achievements, include reviving conservation expertise, an “apolitical ethos” and concern for “aesthetic experience”. It opposes “demonisation” of anyone in the past and wishes to restore the battered morale of National Trust staff and volunteers. It wants the Trust “to use history responsibly as a tool for understanding, not as a weapon”. Restore Trust seeks the help of all members who lack a voice. It can be found at: restore-trust.co.uk"

1.5 million fewer Scots 'would have been vaccinated under SNP demand to join EU scheme'
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/01/15-million-fewer-scots-would-have-vaccinated-snp-demand-join/,"More than 1.5 million fewer Scots would have been vaccinated under the SNP's plan to join the shambolic EU programme, the Scottish Tory leader has disclosed as he hailed the ""incredible success"" of the UK roll-out. Douglas Ross said the roll-out demonstrated the overwhelming benefits of Scotland remaining part of the United Kingdom, with around 2.5 million people having now received their first dose. If   was applied to Scotland, he said this figure would have been only 877,952 and this exposed another ""glaring weakness"" in the nationalist case for separation. Speaking ahead of an election campaign event in which he will set out his NHS spending pledges for the next parliament, Mr Ross said: ""“The SNP are in denial about how much worse off we would be if they had got their way and we were left out of the world-leading UK vaccine scheme."" A series of Ms Sturgeon's ministers demanded the UK sign up to  last year and expressed outrage when Boris Johnson refused. Mike Russell, the Constitution Secretary, warned at the time: ""This idiotic refusal is all about Brexit and nothing to do with the pandemic. It will cost lives."" Maree Todd, the Children's Minister, sarcastically tweeted: ""Of course any drug company in the world who wants to sell a vaccine will definitely come to our relatively tiny market first. Of course they will."" The decision was also publicly opposed by a series of SNP MPs. Instead, the UK Government arranged for British-based AstraZeneca to partner Oxford University to develop the vaccine last year and took the gamble of pouring tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money into setting up a production line before there was any proof that the vaccine would work. Mr Johnson also put Kate Bingham, a life sciences venture capitalist, in charge of the UK's Vaccine Taskforce (VTF) and gave her wide discretion to speed up the process and lay steep bets on vaccine candidates. The VTF bought doses early from seven different candidates and has now secured deals for 407 million doses, enough to vaccinate the population many times over. According to a VTF report, joining the EU's procurement bloc would have barred the UK from making outside negotiations. The EU was months behind in signing its own deals with AstraZeneca and German company Pfizer and is now suffering severe shortages amid production problems on the Continent.  Official figures on Wednesday showed 61 deaths were registered in Scotland last week that mentioned Covid on the death certificate, a fall of five from the previous week. Scotland's Covid death toll has dropped every week since Jan 24 and deaths from all causes are below average for this time of year for the third week in a row. Thursday is the last day of the Scottish Government's ""stay at home"" order. Mr Ross said: ""The vaccination rollout has been an incredible success story across Scotland and the United Kingdom. ""My thanks go to our heroic NHS staff, volunteers in our communities and our Armed Forces who have all stepped up to deliver this astonishing achievement."" He said the Scottish Tories would ""fully"" fund the NHS over the next parliament. Pressed how many people would have been vaccinated in an independent Scotland in the EU, Ms Sturgeon admitted the UK was doing ""incredibly well"" but avoided the question by instead arguing that the country would have performed just as well without Brexit. She told ITV News: ""It would still be open to the UK to secure its own vaccines and to take the decisions it has taken."" She also argued the pandemic will only be over ""when the whole world is properly protected and properly vaccinated."" Mairi Gougeon, the SNP's Public Health Minister, said: ""While Boris Johnson apparently told his Tory MPs that the success of the vaccination roll-out is down to 'greed', we know that that isn't the case. It is down to the brilliance of our scientists and researchers, and our invaluable National Health Service."""

Jean-Claude Juncker attacks Ursula von der Leyen for 'stupid' vaccines trade war with UK
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/25/jean-claude-juncker-attacks-ursula-von-der-leyen-stupid-vaccines/,"Jean-Claude Juncker has attacked Ursula von der Leyen, his successor as European Commission president, for starting  Mr Juncker said he was “not a fan” of Mrs von der Leyen’s threat of imposing an export ban on EU manufactured jabs to the UK and warned it would “create major reputational damage” for the bloc. “We used to be the world's free trade champion,"" he said as EU leaders meet for a summit to discuss the potential ban, ""We have to pull back from a vaccine war.” Mr Juncker also criticised the EU for being too slow in approving and buying vaccines, branding the bloc as “too cautious” and “budget conscious” in an interview with BBC’s HardTalk. The veteran politician led the commission from 2014 to 2019, which included the period after the Brexit referendum.  ""We have special relations with Britain, there's room for dialogue [...] nobody in Britain, nobody in Europe understands why we are witnessing such a stupid vaccine war,” Mr Juncker said.  “What the EU is asking for cannot be dealt with in a war atmosphere. We are not in war and we are not enemies - we are allies."" The former prime minister of Luxembourg added: ""I don't understand this [EU] temptation to fight against Britain, and the British temptation to fight against the EU. Let's discuss it amongst adult people. What is the image we're giving?'"" The EU summit, forced online because of the third wave of coronavirus sweeping Europe, is being held as new trade rules come into force which allow Brussels to target countries, like Britain, with higher vaccination rates than the EU.  The commission has already threatened to block the export of millions of AstraZeneca vaccines from the company's Halix plant in Leiden, the Netherlands. It wants the UK to forego its first refusal on supplies from AstraZeneca’s two British plants so they can supply the bloc. Divided EU leaders are expected to withhold explicit backing for a ban amid fears it could spark a vaccines trade war. But the pressure on Britain is expected to build because France, Germany and Italy all support Mrs von der Leyen’s plan to threaten bans targeted at AstraZeneca. "
,politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/02/no-need-have-endless-testing-interfering-lives/,"According to Professor Chris Whitty, we are going to treat Covid more like flu in future. But that does not match the picture emerging of post-lockdown Britain, not least the Government’s enthusiasm for making Covid tests a central pillar of the plans. When was anyone tested for flu before they were allowed to attend a football match? Yet that is exactly what is being suggested as part of a pilot scheme for reopening large events. Schoolchildren are already being made to take lateral flow tests twice a week – . Whatever system of international travel is eventually implemented is likely to be built to greater or lesser extent around testing. Even when the dreaded Covid passports are up and running, testing is still likely to remain a significant part of our lives. Certainly it will while Britain opens up, and for those too young to have yet been offered a jab.  The Government has achieved one big success during the Covid crisis: its mass vaccination programme, which has seen more than half the adult population inoculated.  Yet it seems disinclined to believe this success and is instead determined to build on its worst failures. Every report into the £37 billion test and trace system has concluded that it has been a massive waste of money. It has failed to pick up cases, test them and process the results in time; it has failed to identify and track down contacts; and it has failed to persuade those contacts to self-isolate. True, requiring a negative Covid test before you can travel or go to the pub will get round the problem of persuading people to take one. But without a system of tracing and enforcement, don’t expect much compliance with ongoing quarantine rules. That is without considering the problem of false positives. Testing is expensive. It is also time consuming and unpleasant for the individuals involved. It is also likely to damage business. Sorry, but having to stick a swab down my throat before I can go to a concert is going to ruin the experience for me – I’d rather stay at home and watch something on YouTube.  What is not clear is what we stand to gain. The proportion of people refusing the vaccine is down in single figures – according to the Office of National Statistics, 90.2 per cent of the over-70s had already had the jab by March 11. We also know that the jabs are highly effective at conferring immunity. Once we reach a stage where the vaccine has been widely adopted and works well, the risk to others of any individual having Covid is not great enough to justify endless testing interfering in our lives.  A year ago, there was no guarantee that effective vaccines would be developed, and it might have made sense to try to develop a system of testing to prevent superspreader events and to drive down cases. To persist with it now is just a sop to the vested interests which have already raked in a fortune from manufacturing and running tests and stand to make even more if we are all forced to download health apps and get tested at every opportunity."

Why the rise of the micro-wedding is changing how couples plan their big day
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/weddings/advice/rise-micro-wedding-changing-couples-plan-big-day/,"When newly engaged Dah-Eun Chae first pictured her dream wedding day, one thing was for certain: it would be a big, raucous occasion. That was the plan until the pandemic hit and turned everything on its head. After rejigging arrangements four times, the wedding that transpired – an intimate church service and a sit-down dinner for 15 – couldn’t have been more different, but as it turns out, it was exactly what Dah-Eun and her now-husband Tony never knew they wanted. ‘It was the best day ever,’ she smiles. With Covid restrictions capping guest numbers, micro-weddings have become the norm. And even though it looks like we can party pre-pandemic-style from the end of June, according to a survey by wedding planners Hitched, half of couples who postponed weddings due to take place between September and January are still cutting their guest list by 25 per cent or more. With celebrities like   and   leading the charge for the ‘minimony’ (a mini ceremony held just for loved ones), there’s no doubt more will be following suit. ‘Smaller weddings are having a real moment right now,’ says wedding planner Anne Ladegast-Chiu, ‘and couples are looking to make them as unique as possible.’ After 21 June – when larger weddings look set to be given the green light – it’s thought that couples will still forego the big bash, as priorities continue to shift. For so many of us, the pandemic year has been a wake-up call – a reminder of what, and who, we hold dearest. It’s not surprising, then, that couples are keen to strip away excessive pomp. Still, couples aren’t necessarily cutting corners with costs, with 47 per cent telling Hitched they’d be sticking with roughly the same budget as they’d planned before the pandemic. With all the pent-up demand outstripping supply, many couples are more willing to pay higher prices to have their dream day, even with smaller guest lists. If your budget hasn’t changed but your numbers have, it means you can opt for the better champagne. Rather than bowing to pressures of etiquette, they are instead focusing on what they want. ‘There’s a real sense of, “We are doing this our way,”’ says Natalie Watts, a wedding photographer. Swapping fustier traditions for more relaxed, dialled-back proceedings is a trend making its way down the aisle, too, notes photographer Gillian Lawtie Currie, who says she’s seen more brides scrap the idea of having their father give them away. At a wedding in Old Marylebone Town Hall last December, she says, the bride and groom strode in, hand-in-hand, to greet their party of eight together. It’s not just the ceremony that’s being reinvigorated, either: the wedding dress has also had an overhaul. ‘Now the ceremony is not so traditional, brides can have more fun pushing their look,’ says wedding-dress designer   And post-lockdown ‘dopamine dressing’ has hit brides-to-be too with many embracing colour and separates. According to Net-a-Porter’s Libby Page: ‘Brides are opting for shorter lengths and less formal dress styles, which they can buy now and wear for ever.’ And with sustainability top of the agenda, more are turning to vintage and rental services to find ‘the one’, with searches for bridalwear on the rental site By Rotation jumping 400 per cent since March 2020. The designers themselves have also been busy adjusting to this new era of Covid weddings.   has been offering London brides virtual dress fittings. ‘We do an initial Zoom to talk through the look, then they send in images of themselves in their favourite evening gown. We then put three [dress] selections together in a taxi to their house – we’ve had to adapt, as have the brides.’ Sassi even plans to continue the service after the shops reopen on 12 April. ‘All of our brides said they found Zoom appointments useful,’ she says, and because many of the brides’ families are overseas, virtual try-ons and fittings have proved handy. A move away from the vast celebrations of old has made space for alternative venues to throw open their doors – a favourite coffee shop, for example. Kate Weir, weddings manager at  , remembers a reception last December at the Hackney Coffee Company, where the shop’s living plant walls made a beautiful backdrop. ‘The flowers became this real focal point,’ she says. Gina Conolly, who got married in August last year at Battersea Park bandstand – with six guests and a dog – loved her laid-back, outdoor nuptials. ‘Afterwards, we spent the afternoon sunbathing – I wouldn’t have changed a thing,’ she says. Private dining at a favoured restaurant, rather than taking over the entire space, has also been popular, and that doesn’t always mean having to leave home, either. ‘We created a whole Nobu restaurant in a suburban garden,’ notes Adam Phillips from Uptown Events. Chefs fashioned a menu for 26, ‘with personalised chopsticks and stones engraved with everyone’s names. It looked amazing.’ At so many recent weddings, that meticulousness and thought also extended to absent friends, many of whom still wanted in on the action. ‘As a substitute group shot, we’ve taken a lot of photos of brides and grooms holding phones with people Zooming or FaceTiming,’ says Gillian Lawtie Currie.  And live-streaming is now a given – bride Dah-Eun, who had her London ceremony streamed to 60 loved ones in 10 countries, knows first-hand how important that felt. ‘It was really special,’ she remembers. And though many couples have had to trim their guest lists, they still found imaginative – and socially distanced – ways to include their wider circle. Photographer Blake Ezra recalls a wedding where the whole street came out to celebrate. ‘All the neighbours, people that had known the bride since she was a child, waved her off – it was pure joy,’ he says. Scene-setting with florals, backdrops and tablescaping, has been crucial in bringing smaller weddings to life. Giving maximum attention to one focal point, like the table, helps to create a cosy, supper-club feel. Royal florist  describes a 15-guest reception at the Ned in London in December 2020, festooned with winter-white florals, ivy and sprigs of pine – so ‘they felt they were dining within a bower of blooms’. While Gillian photographed a reception for 10 in a London garden, where the couple invested in beautiful Matilda Goad tableware, with flowers strewn throughout the house and garden. ‘People feel like they have permission now to have a smaller wedding,’ she notes. What these Covid-era celebrations have shown is that big isn’t always better: it’s the people you share your day with that matter and are the true source of joy. For Dah-Eun, the elation felt on her big (small) day hasn’t worn off yet. ‘Sometimes, I’ll turn to Tony and say, “Can you believe we did it?”’ she smiles. ‘I wouldn’t change a single thing.’ Mastering your own bridal beauty can feel empowering and allows you a look that is truly you. Make-up artist   shows us how to get it right for the Big Day: If you don't know what look you want, search out tutorials online by brands or make-up artists you love for some ideas – Charlotte Tilbury and Lisa Eldridge have brilliant bridal YouTube tutorials. Once you have decided on what you want to emulate, try it out and then stick to it – don’t wing it on the day.   You want your make-up to be camera-ready, so long-wearing products and waterproof mascaras are brilliant. And if you’re appearing on a computer screen, I always advocate eyeliner. Set your make-up aside in a separate bag to make your wedding morning routine easier.  Get someone in the bridal party to take a picture of you (a phone camera will do) facing towards good daylight – study the photo to see if your finished look needs any tweaking. "

When are weddings back to normal in 2021? Latest Covid-19 rules and advice for your big day
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/weddings/advice/wedding-covid-rules-should-cancel-2021-roadmap-advice-guests-uk/,"Following months of a third national lockdown,  . As of March 29, the 'rule of six' is back, meaning six people or two households can meet up outside. The 'stay at home' guidance has been dropped, although the government still advises all to stay local. As loved ones are able to reunite, what do the new rules mean for occasions like weddings?   Firstly, and most importantly, nuptials are now allowed to take place – with up to six guests present. The government's   states there will be a gradual easing of number of guests allowed to attend ceremonies. This will commence in four 'steps'  – with Step 1 allowing the 'rule of six' (more on Steps 2-4 below). All events must adhere to social distancing guidelines.  During lockdown, weddings were only allowed to take place in 'exceptional circumstances' – a so-called 'deathbed wedding', where one of those getting married is seriously ill and unlikely to recover, or about to undergo debilitating or life-altering surgery or treatment. Many couples have now found a renewed optimism. On the evening of Boris Johnson's roadmap announcement on February 22, wedding planner app Bridebook saw a 720 per cent increase in traffic, and, before the site crashed, 735 couples booked to get married on June 21 - when weddings are predicted to be allowed to go ahead with no guest cap. Here's everything you need to know about Covid-secure weddings in the months ahead.  From March, the Government has enacted Step 1 of its roadmap out of lockdown. This means that weddings can take place, with a capacity of six people for an  .  However, from April 12, the rules will be slightly relaxed as the UK enters Step 2 of the plan.   - presumably, with social distancing measures in place. From May 17, Step 3 is expecting to take place. Weddings will be allowed up to 30 guests.  And finally, if all goes according to plan, Step 4 will take effect from June 21. In this stage, there will be no legal limits on social contact on weddings or funerals - meaning a welcome return of traditional big weddings.  “I strongly believe weddings will be back in the summer,” says Bernadette Chapman, head of the UK Alliance of Wedding Planners, “but also 2022 is set to be a boom year for weddings with many couples booking suppliers and planners now.” All of this, however, is circumstantial - and will depend on the success of the vaccination programme, harmful new strains, and the toll on the NHS.  All events must be Covid-secure and guests must adhere to social-distancing guidelines at all times. People are required to maintain two-metre social distancing and wear face coverings throughout the ceremony. Singing is also avoided in order to prevent airborne transmission of the virus.  It depends whether you're hoping for a bigger bash. If you're content with a more intimate affair, you may wish to keep your date. If you'd like to celebrate with more than 30 guests, it is wise to postpone for later in the year.  Chapman says that the Government's roadmap ""was disappointing to those marrying prior to June"".  ""Many of these couples have already postponed weddings three or four times and following the announcement, the wedding industry was flooded with requests to move weddings yet again,"" she adds . What about those  ? Wedding planner   predicts some couples whose weddings are booked for June or July ""will be nervous about how close that deadline is - there are so many parameters that feed into whether the 21st June will happen or not”. She therefore advises caution. “I would love for us to [have big summer weddings]. I am personally and professionally proceeding with caution just because we have had promises in the past... it’s something I am being very open and honest with my couples about.” Over 50 per cent of her couples have already postponed their weddings to 2022. There are still wedding spaces in 2022 but “peak dates are booked... we are looking at Thursday, Friday, Sunday weddings or looking out of season - April, October, November”. Yet, at the same time, at least celebrations are now a possibility. Otter received a “flurry of enquiries” after the roadmap announcement. This year is “totally doable”, she says, as so many venues and suppliers have had cancellations and postponements. She urges couples to “stick with the plans, but maybe carry on reviewing it every so often”. Monitor how we are getting on with the four-step roadmap out of lockdown. If you make the decision to postpone your wedding, you should give as much notice to your suppliers and venue as possible. “The latest they can probably leave it is a month or two before their wedding,” says wedding planner Matthew Oliver. “If your wedding is in April this year and you’re thinking, ‘actually, I think it’s pretty clear I’m not going to have 150 people at my wedding in London’, I’d say let’s have a look at moving it now, rather than waiting until mid-February or March,” Oliver says. However, if you have no choice but to postpone your wedding, due to sudden Government restrictions, there could be more leniency. “If it’s a case that the rules change... then that would most likely happen days to weeks before the wedding.” Ideally, however, you would be able to give your supplier a week’s notice, as that’s when the florists and caterers would start arranging the flowers and food. It’s a good idea to ask them to put this off as long as possible, according to Oliver. After you’ve decided to change your wedding date, “the biggest challenge,” according to Oliver, “is finding a new date that works for all of your existing suppliers”. With that in mind, you should try to be as flexible as possible. “Most wedding venues have hugely busy diaries already – a combination of weddings postponed from 2020 and a busy 2021 even on its own merits, with many relationships having, happily, accelerated through 2020,” says Sam Cutmore-Scott, managing director of Bijou Weddings. “This demand is already spilling over into 2022... and can lead to longer waiting lists.""  Otter tells me that one couple wanted to move their wedding, which was supposed to take place in September 2020, to any Saturday between the beginning of April and end of October 2021. There was only one date that all of the suppliers could do. This is “turning into a bit of an issue,” Oliver says. “I know a number of suppliers are giving people who are postponing some priority over dates, but again we’re also not going to turn away new work as well – because we have to make up the money we have lost over the last year.” The shortage of dates available is partly due to a shortage of venues, Oliver says. Many of these venues have booked more weddings in a week than they usually would, and are now “reaching capacity”.  Currently, international travel is banned in the UK. It is now illegal to go abroad without a 'reasonable excuse', and anyone who does leave the country could face a £5,000 fine. This ban is in currently in place until June 30, although   to 'green list' countries from May 17. Even so, it seems unlikely that international weddings will be permitted for some time.  Weddings will “absolutely” have to adapt in the future, according to Oliver. “I feel like we will need have to look at bigger venue options,” he says. “For instance, if you’re working with a couple that are inviting 150 guests, instead of looking for venues that hold exactly 150 people, we’re going to have to look for venue options that are larger.” This would be to allow guests to socially distance – which, he thinks, will still be our mentality after lockdown is over. “After this whole situation is finished, people are still going to have that in their way of life – of ‘I don’t want to be close to you,’” he says, adding that venues and suppliers might be more “protective” about their contact with guests. Other wedding venues have also found creative solutions. Bijou Wedding Venues, which specialises in country house weddings, will use ""airport quality"" temperature reading cameras to test all staff and guest temperatures on arrival, and will live-stream the ceremony to different areas of the venue, so the mandatory witnesses can be present at the ceremony and the other guests can view it from a safe distance.  The wedding venues company also plans to replace buffet queues with table service, install marquees and gazebos to maximise time outdoors, and hold ceremonies outdoors where possible. The wedding industry is a £14.7bn sector, employing 400,000 workers in the UK. Weddings being capped at six or even later at 30 “doesn’t make any commercial sense,” says Tamryn Settle, head of the ‘What About Weddings?’ campaign. The multiple postponements has had a real impact on the wedding industry. “Everyone in the industry has had a year of no income and we are absolutely decimated as an industry and cannot carry on for much longer,” says Otter. She says the industry needs “extra and specific targeted funding” to survive. Sarah Haywood, chairperson of the UK Weddings Taskforce, says they are “negotiating hard with the Government on a financial support package that will act as a bridge to allow businesses to realise this potential”."

How to host the perfect garden party - whatever the weather
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/interiors/home/host-perfect-garden-party-whatever-weather/,"If ever your garden needed to be an extension of your home, it’s now. With   entertaining – albeit safely and up to six people – back on the agenda, outdoor spaces look likely to be our social hubs for some time to come. So it’s no surprise that the trend for garden styling that started last summer is set to continue through spring and beyond. According to research by the website  , 47 per cent of us are planning   this year, from adding planting to installing lighting, heating and garden rooms. There are also plenty of small tweaks you can make to your outside space now to make it a welcoming place for guests. Pay as much attention to your table as you would if it were inside, and set it before your guests arrive, taking into account social distancing. Even the scruffiest table is transformed by a tablecloth, flowers, plates and glassware – and consider bringing your indoor dining chairs out to ensure guests are as comfortable as possible. ‘My partner and I cook and eat outside whenever it’s warm enough,’ says the artist Fee Greening, who set up this cheering table in the garden of her Dorset home, using a daffodil-yellow cloth from Oka. ‘You won’t find me writing name cards and menus at every meal,’ she adds, ‘but if there has ever been a year to celebrate seeing friends and family, it’s this one. I think a beautiful menu or place setting can lend some magic to an occasion.’ She has used a mix of rattan place mats, simple white plates, mismatched vases and glassware for a stylish but unstuffy look. ‘I prefer tables to feel a bit thrown together,’ she says. ‘It feels more relaxed. I usually pick flowers from the garden or collect something from the wood. One of my favourite plants to use is gorse: I love the combination of its jolly yellow flowers and lethal spikes.’ For a summery table similar to this one, look for linens and crockery in colours that echo the plants in the garden, chunky glasses that won’t topple over, and jugs for flowers and greenery. Set up a parasol or gazebo in case of sudden showers, and use stones or clip-on tablecloth weights to keep the cloth in place. The challenge of keeping your garden warm, sheltered and welcoming during unpredictable spring weather might account for the fact that sales of gazebos and garden heaters are going through the roof (up 123 per cent and 109 per cent respectively on this time last year at Argos). Firepits were bestsellers last summer as we sought to create a festival vibe at home, but if you don’t want to smoke out your garden (or the neighbours), try an outdoor wood burner that will channel the smoke upwards, a gas heater, or for the ecofriendly option, a bio-ethanol outdoor fire (try  ). When it comes to shelter, for something a little more special than a standard pop-up gazebo, try Cox & Cox for pretty fringed versions (see above) or Raj Tent Club for spectacular pergolas that wouldn’t look out of place in the VIP area at Glastonbury (from £1,400,  ). Alternatively, keep it simple and opt for a minimalist garden sail (below), which can be fastened to a wall, fence or tree and kept in place all summer – Primrose sells waterproof sails in a range of colours (from £39.99,  ). Blankets and outdoor cushions help to create a cosy vibe, and an outdoor rug under the dining table or in front of a garden sofa will cover up tired decking or cracked paving, as well as adding softness and colour. The evenings are longer now, but if you want to extend your time in the garden – with or without guests – good lighting is a must. Helen White, co-founder of lighting brand  , suggests stringing festoon lights from fences, posts and pergolas, ‘to recreate the atmosphere of a trendy bar’. ‘There are also some good options for hanging lights in trees and over tables using umbrella stands,’ she adds. ‘If you don’t have electricity points in your garden, it’s not a problem. There are really good-quality solar-powered lights available now. Use multiples for a brighter light, as they aren’t as strong as mains-powered lighting: for example, light up your borders with downlighters, which can be easily attached to the fence.’ Portable lamps that you can charge up indoors and take outside to put on the table or hang from a wall or tree are also easy to come by, and a fuss-free way of adding pools of glow to create atmosphere. Get the restaurant experience in your own home by creating an informal bar area for pre-dinner drinks. Habitat has reported that garden bars are already up 568 per cent this year, proving that last summer’s cocktail-making trend is in no danger of slowing down. Where there’s space, a free-standing tiki-style bar with stools creates a social spot; or keep it simple with a drinks trolley on wheels or a lightweight tray table you can carry outdoors. If you’re short on flowers in the borders, invest in some potted outdoor plants and trees to dot around the dining or drinking area. These add an instant splash of colour and a decorative touch that will last year-round."

How to plan an outdoor wedding, from venue ideas to garden decor and best dresses
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/weddings/essentials/plan-outdoor-wedding-venue-ideas-garden-decor-best-dresses/,"Whether you imagine a micro-wedding in your back garden or walking down the aisle in a woodland glade, the idea of an outdoor wedding has evergreen appeal. Since the coronavirus pandemic and the resultant restrictions for weddings and receptions, its popularity has soared. According to  , searches for ‘ ’ have risen 160 per cent. Given that   in the months ahead, it’s tricky to get plans for your wedding day set in stone. But, good news brides and grooms-to-be – there’s no reason you can’t start planning ahead for your dream outdoor wedding in the months to come. First thing’s first – weather. In the UK, you’ll be spoilt for choice on beautiful venues, but there’s always the possibility that rain may stop play. “Always have a plan A and B, with plan B being the wet weather option,” says wedding planner Katie Slater, founder of  , which specialises in unique outdoor weddings – from themed forests to secret gardens.  “If a couple has hired a marquee, ensure the ceremony can take place in the marquee if the weather’s bad. Or, you could reserve some budget for a stretch tent.”  If you’re not sure where to start, the first step is to set a clear budget with your other half. “I tell all my couples to have a figure in mind right from the start, so they can work back and decide how much to spend on each element,” she says. This is especially important for outdoor weddings, where costs on the practical elements – for instance, refrigeration, lighting and parking – can quickly stack up.  “Everybody forgets about power,” Slater says, “plus toilets and a fridge trailer to hold all your food and wine in.” If you have a guest list of 50+ people, an amplification system or speakers will be necessary for everyone to be able to hear, she adds.  From dreamy outdoor venues to inspiration for decor, flowers and the all-important dress, we’ve compiled this guide to planning an outdoor wedding to tell you everything you need to know. The sky’s the limit (literally) when it comes to outdoor wedding venues. From wonderland woodland settings to festival fields, beachside ceremonies, a rustic barn or a garden marquee, there's an nuptials space to suit every taste. But it's essential you remember the logistics.  In order to have your legal wedding ceremony outdoors, it needs to take place under a licensed structure. “Many venues will have outdoor ceremony areas, such as a gazebo, that you can get married under,” says Slater.  If that option isn’t for you, there’s no reason you can’t head to a church or registry office for the legalities and then a reception to follow. “You can go to a registrar the day before and then have a heartfelt, meaningful ‘ceremony’ on your wedding day,” she says.  Here are some of our favourite outdoor wedding venues to add to your moodboard:  Undoubtedly one of the best (and most stylish) woodland wedding venues in the UK. Cripps Barn will provide you with the winning combination of a rustic woodland ceremony followed by a luxury barn-conversion reception with heaps of greenery-inspired decorations and a BBQ feast.  This quirky wedding venue on a former farm offers outdoor ceremonies for up to 170 guests in a pavilion with rolling views of Lancashire countryside. They even have bow-tie-wearing llamas on hand to join in the celebrations. Prices for 2022 start from £4,500.  A truly unique seaside wedding venue with a private beach, accessed through a hand-carved tunnel in a cliff (yes, really). Tunnels Beaches offers outdoor ceremonies in a thatched gazebo, plus exclusive use of their contemporary beachfront venue, which boasts panoramic views out to sea.  An outdoor wedding is a good opportunity to throw out the rule book when it comes to traditional wedding gowns. Whether it’s chic tailoring, a colourful dress or a relaxed style (think wedding denim jacket - yes, it's a thing), it’s entirely up to you how glam you go for your alfresco nuptials. “While in the past, people might have felt pressured to wear a big gown, now jumpsuits, midi and mini dresses have become a lot more popular,” says Jess Kaye, co-founder of London-based wedding wear label  . “Practical considerations like hemlines come into play, as if you’re getting married outdoors you’re probably going to be walking across grass.”  Here are a handful of our favourite outdoor wedding dresses for inspiration:  This modern, ruffled dress from Whistles’ bridal collection is the perfect match for a summer outdoor wedding thanks to its relaxed fit, floor-skimming length and subtle cut-out detail.  OWN Studio offers a range of breathtaking bridal designs, but for a versatile piece that you can wear again, opt for one of their silky slips. This bias cut dress comes in 11 gorgeous colours and would make a brilliant dress for a contemporary bride or a particularly stylish tribe of bridesmaids.  Who says wedding dresses have to be full length? Whether it’s a second outfit for your evening reception or a non-traditional wedding dress, this airy chiffon mini is worthy of a place on your wish list.  Your ‘save the dates’ and wedding invitations are the first thing your guests will see ahead of your big day, so why not make them extra special? These fun outdoor-themed wedding invitations will set the tone:  If you’ve gone with a carnival, big-top or circus theme for your outdoor wedding, these handmade invites from Garden Studio are the perfect choice. The colours are adjustable based on your wedding colour scheme.  Botanical-themed wedding invites will get your guests ready for a chic celebration in the great outdoors. Confetti Designs has loads of gorgeous floral and plant designs, but we especially love these bohemian eucalyptus-printed invitations. If you’re having a festival-themed outdoor wedding, it stands to reason that you’d want invites to match. These fun ‘wed-fest’ invites will be a lasting memento for your guests long after your wedding day.  Once the logistics of the venue, guest list and practical considerations are out of the way, you can get on with the fun stuff. Cue gorgeous flowers and decorations. Lighting is key – and, in an outdoor setting, getting this right can be more of a challenge. Consider covering your venue or outdoor area in festoon lighting ( ) for a warm, romantic atmosphere. Scattered hurricane candles will bathe your venue in twinkling candlelight.  When it comes to decorating your tables, Slater says a few, larger centrepieces or installations make a bigger impact if you’re strapped for cash: “I advise my couples to do a few high impact items rather than lots of little table decorations, which can easily get lost,” she says. Etsy sell a range of flower arches which would make a picture-perfect backdrop for your nuptials ( ).  The dancing is drawing to a close and your guests are awaiting their taxis (or, in some cases, heading back to their tents). What should you give them as a wedding favour? You could choose a gift based on your theme. For instance, in keeping with the outdoor celebrations, you could order   for your guests to take home and plant as a memory of your big day. If you’ve gone with a festival theme, you could gift your guests sparklers, which are cheap to buy in bulk and can be personalised with these  .  Alternatively, edible wedding favours always go down a treat – you could opt for   or  . "

How to buy an engagement ring: From size and design to diamond carat, all your questions answered
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/weddings/engagement/how-buy-engagement-ring-choose-right-size-diamond-carat-design/,"So, you've decided you're ready to pop the question. Whilst you may have a loose idea where you may get down on one knee and what you may say, there's a lot to consider when it comes done to that special ring for your bride or groom-to-be.   Whilst initial questions around engagement rings may start as gold or silver, princess or oval cut, vintage or bespoke – the devil's in the detail. From budget to style, and most-asked questions, here's the ultimate guide to buying the engagement ring of his or hers' dreams.  If you don’t already feel confident that you know their style, ask their friends or family members– but only if you trust their discretion. The last thing you want is for your partner to catch wind of your plan. Take tips from their wardrobe and the jewellery they already wear. Do they favour classic fashions, minimalist jewellery, label-heavy handbags or avant-garde jewels? Chances are they won’t want to discard all of their existing gems when they slip on this ring, so make sure it complements their tried-and-tested favourites. As much as they’ll want to wear the ring straight away and never take it off, it’s not the end of the world if you need to get it resized. Usually the jeweller you buy it from will do this for you, unless it’s a complicated antique piece or a very unusual ring, which may require more specialist attention. The easiest way to find out their size is to slip away with a ring they already wear on their ring finger (closest to the little finger), take it to any jeweller and get them to tell you the size. Or, print out a ring sizing guide (  has a handy one) to do this yourself. Lucky you. Now you can spend a little more on the design and manufacture. It’s best to be fairly certain of your partner’s tastes if doing this though, as if the end result goes down badly, you’ve just thrown money down the drain. Also, get the stones properly certified before handing them over to a jeweller if this hasn’t already been done.   offers a diamond and gemstone grading service and is backed by the Birmingham Assay Office. Jewellers make their money largely from selling stones and precious metal, so don’t expect Harry Winston to knock you something up to your specifications with Grandma’s sapphires – although it will work with you on something bespoke, but in its style, with its own stones. If you really want to design your own piece and use your own stones, you need a manufacturing jeweller, not a designer. London’s Hatton Garden is awash with designer-makers, like  , which has been around since 1745.   You’d be surprised at how many jewellers – from big name Bond Street houses to small independent jewellers – will help you design your own ring and get it made, but usually you’ll also need to buy the stones from them as well. The high end Mayfair jeweller   has an entire floor dedicated to exquisite engagement rings, but will also work with clients on creating a bespoke ring – be it an enormous 10-carat stone in a classic Georgian cut-back setting or a something more personal incorporating unique features like secret messages on the shank. The independent, Notting Hill-based jeweller   only makes around  , so getting her to design your engagement ring would be a real coup, although don’t expect anything simple – Adriana’s work is avant-garde, art-deco inspired and not for the faint-hearted. Plenty of jewellers will design something around your own stones, but if you’re determined that you don’t want any designer input, one of the new direct-to-customer diamond dealers like   will both sell you loose stones and allow you to design the setting. It totally depends on the person. Either they’ll say nothing, in which case it’s not an issue and you can go on being blissfully oblivious to their wants and needs, or they'll tell you. Or the look of utter disdain on their face will. It’s not a total disaster. Like most things, there’s always the chance of an exchange, or less likely, a refund – but find out what the deal is before putting cold cash down. And don’t take it too personally. Chances are they have been thinking about what their dream engagement ring looks like forever. Not only are   having a serious revival, but they’re gaining in value to make them a worthwhile investment. Most people wear their engagement rings everyday, so stick to  . Diamonds are the hardest, but emeralds, for example, are relatively soft, and not ideal for everyday banging about. No! Don’t forget that diamonds come in other colours, as does gold. Maison Dauphin, one of the newer fine jewellery houses, does a really gorgeous line in black diamonds set in blue gold (white gold finished with blue rhodium) which would make for an unbelievably contemporary engagement ring. Glenn Spiro has a range of engagement rings in classic styles but set in beautiful coloured   – a pop of vivid colour in a traditional setting. Similarly, jeweller Raphaele Canot has mastered the use of enamel in rings and her OMG series of diamond, gold, and enamel rings in the shape of an open mouth would suit a bride with a sense of humour. Or, sticking to white diamonds and yellow gold, British jeweller Alex Monroe’s new line of Wild Rose diamond rings are a sweetly sylvan option for lovers of whimsy. It’s okay by me – but will they like it? Personally, I find proper antique jewellery hard to beat, and spend hours trawling sites like  , or looking at the stock of dealers like   or  . But vintage isn’t for everyone. If they can’t walk past Oxfam without gagging, stick to brand spanking new. Gray’s Antiques in W1 is an incredible treasure trove of jewellery dealers under one roof, with thousands upon thousands of vintage and antique pieces on display all the time – a casual stroll through there with one’s beloved and a beady eye out to see which styles light up their face might be wise. There are all sorts of myths about having to spend a certain multiple of your monthly salary on a ring, but you know your financial situation better than some random calculation would. The comfort rule is a good one. If you can comfortably afford it, you’re not spending enough. You want to wince just slightly when making that transaction. Diamonds may be a girl’s best friend, but they’re also a commodity with a market value. Subscribers to the   can follow their value or work out the wholesale value of a particular stone based mainly on the four Cs – Carat, Cut, Clarity, and Colour. There are plenty of online calculators that will do the same thing, but your best bet is to compare and contrast in the real world. How much is the jeweller next door selling the same 1 carat D-coloured VS1 brilliant for? Shop around, and don’t be afraid to barter."

How to transform your home with paint and colour
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/interiors/home/how-paint-update-home-best-style-ideas-colours-diy-2021/,"This weekend marks the first day of spring, and kicks off a new season of decorating - which might feel particularly pressing this year, as we prepare finally to welcome guests back into our homes in the coming months. A lick of something fresh on the walls is often the quickest and most transformative way to impact a space, not to mention the cheapest. But before you reach for a pot of plain emulsion, wait up. There are some exciting and less conventional finishes to consider that will elevate your interiors and give them a fresh, fashion-forward look. Here’s our guide to the ones to know.  Gloss certainly isn’t the new kid on the block, but the way it’s being used right now feels fresh. ‘The shiny surface encourages light to bounce around in a really uplifting way to create a sense of space and depth, even in smaller rooms,’ says Dominic Myland of paint brand  , which has seen demand for gloss increase over the past year. For an unexpected twist, Joa Studholme, colour curator at  , suggests using the brand’s full gloss on ceilings: ‘If you use the same colour as your walls, then the ceiling height will appear to go up and you create a truly magical space.’ She also suggests using gloss to make a feature, such as painting a stair runner in a strong tone and contrasting it with a lighter eggshell colour on the rest of the staircase. You could start small and experiment with a faux bedhead, or paint a pin - board above your workspace. A split finish – whereby the lower part of the wall, which endures much more traffic, is painted in gloss and contrasted with a flat emulsion above – is savvy for hallways, stairs and children’s rooms. Sanding is key if your surface is uneven and two coats are a must; spraying gives a beautiful glass finish, and if you’re using a brush, always lay off in the same direction. If matt paint is more your thing, then look up Dulux’s new   range. The collection comprises 112 contemporary colours inspired by British architecture and design through the ages, and boasts a velvety finish that is said to feel as good as it looks. ‘The wonderful thing about all matt finishes is that they absorb light, which means that you don’t notice the odd lump and bump as much as you would on a gloss or semi-sheen finish,’ says Marianne Shillingford, the brand’s creative director. Her favourite shade is Midnight Teal: ‘It is where green and blue meet and looks amazing in different light conditions, from dawn till dusk.’ The USP of the Heritage range is that it’s luxurious yet wipeable, and more practical than most matt finishes. Marianne suggests using it in a relaxed and grown-up setting like a bedroom or living room, ‘any room in which you want a touch of well-deserved luxury’.  For the industrial look that is much-desired but not seen in many homes, why not play around with a special-effect paint? Scottish brand Craig & Rose has created on-trend concrete and copper finishes as part of its Artisan Special Effects range. ‘A distressed metallic wall or polished concrete is a favourite of interior designers with a large budget,’ says Jane Rockett, co-founder of interiors e-tailer Rockett St George, which stocks the brand. ‘These paints achieve that look at a fraction of the cost and add a gorgeous, unique finish to any space.’ She suggests using the concrete finish in larger spaces, such as an open-plan kitchen or living area, where you can fully appreciate the effect, and adding other natural textures like wood and greenery to give greater depth. Craig & Rose’s warming Copper Effect is brought to life by dragging a brush over the surface while the paint is still wet, and can subsequently be treated with a patina solution to create a rust effect. ‘I have seen this used up a stairway and on a landing – it looks spectacular in those spaces that can often be overlooked,’ says Jane. She advises practising on a piece of board first to get familiar with the paints, then using a roller for the first coat and a brush for the second. ‘Apply in sweeping movements and once you’ve got to grips with it, go for it and enjoy creating something remarkable!’  If you’ve been drawn to the textured, earthy walls peppering your Instagram feed, then there’s probably one name responsible: Bauwerk. This Australian company specialises in natural lime washes, which react with the air on application to create a matt, stone-like finish. Emma Shone-Sanders, co-founder of interior design studio and store Design & That ( ), has used Bauwerk both in her boutique and at home. ‘There’s something almost dream-like about the build-up texture, which adds a depth and interest to the walls and space,’ she says. After much practice, Emma has this tip: ‘Always keep the edge wet as you work across the wall, so you don’t end up with a harsh line where it dries. The beauty is in the softness of the brush strokes as they start to layer up and build texture.’"

How to build a garden office for as little as £5k
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/interiors/home/garden-office-has-become-ultimate-lockdown-musthave/,"After Covid-19 restrictions have forced many to embrace working from home full-time – the way we think about our home work spaces has changed. The kitchen table or tiny desk crammed in next to the spare bed were fine when working in pyjamas was a novelty, but now  , in terms of boosting both productivity and the way we feel about our homes. Research by the Royal Institute of British Architects ( ) during the pandemic showed that 17 per cent of homeowners were looking to create an office space to support working from home permanently. The issue is how to create a quiet space that will allow us to separate home life from work life: a matter that has been brought to the fore as families have juggled working,   and living in very close quarters. This may explain why self contained garden rooms soared in popularity whilst lockdown restrictions were in place: searches for ‘garden office’ were already up 72 per cent on the home-improvement website   by the end of summer in 2020. ‘We have seen an increase in demand from clients with ample garden space, now not only considering the landscaping design, but also prioritising an additional garden room to be used as a recreational retreat or as a work-from-home study,’ says architect Alex Michaelis ( ), who designed a modern flat-roofed version, clad in charred timber (pictured below), for a family home in London.  A custom-designed garden room allows for endless possibilities, aesthetically as well as practically. Another example, by AO Architecture ( ), lined with marble on the outside and timber on the inside (pictured top), acts as an office during the week and a bar at the weekend, allowing its owners to keep both work and entertaining away from the family spaces of the rest of their home. Prefab structures that can save on time and costs are similarly in hot demand: the homeware brand Bert & May, known for its covetable patterned tiles, also produces stand-alone ‘Bert’s Boxes’, like little cabins, and has seen a 50 per cent increase in enquiries since the first lockdown started. Its latest, the Study Box (from £33,000,  ), is designed specifically as an office, with full-height windows to connect homeworkers with their outside space (pictured below). The new breed of garden room has a cool, contemporary aesthetic and a focus on improving the concentration levels and overall happiness of whoever is using it. ‘If there is one thing we have all learnt from this pandemic, it’s that our mental and emotional health is hugely impacted by the environment surrounding us,’ says Freddie Sheridan of design agency  , which recently launched a collection of bespoke garden rooms that it calls Breathing Rooms (pictured second from top; from £15,000,  ). Similarly characterised by walls of glazing that open up the space to the outside world, the structures are intended, says Sheridan, to ‘empower you to work your best, be productive, and boost your well-being’. Garden buildings at the side or back of the house don’t require planning permission as long as they are less than 2.5m in height, take up no more than 50 per cent of the land around the house, and are no closer to a road than the house itself. If you live in a conservation area, it must be at the back of the house, and if you live in a listed building you will require planning permission. I built my garden office about five years ago, after I was made redundant and went freelance. I had started out working in our spare room, which was tiny: I wasn’t even able to shut the door. I knew our house couldn’t be extended, so the solution was to install an outbuilding. I found a specialist company,   (prices from around £19,000), and decided to have glass doors along one side so that I had a good view. There’s a high window and a skylight to maximise the amount of daylight coming in without causing any privacy concerns. I also wanted a ‘green’ sedum roof to replace the lawn area the studio took up, which has helped to redress the balance of my garden, and attracts wildlife. I often tell people that building the studio was the best thing I could have done. Not only does it mean I have a dedicated work space, I can close the door on it at the end of a day. It’s proved to be priceless for my well-being and work-life balance."

The style set's favourite interior designer on her decor essentials
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/design/style-sets-favourite-interior-designer-decor-essentials/,"Beata Heuman is a woman in demand. Since she set up her own studio in 2013, after nine years working with Nicky Haslam, the Swedish-born, London-based designer has carved a name for herself with her imaginative and elegantly executed interior-design projects, packed with colour, pattern and carefully conceived bespoke elements. Products from her homeware line, including made-to-order furniture, lighting and accessories, along with fabrics and wallpapers, have become Instagram stars in their own right (her Marbleized and Palm Drop prints in particular), and are spotted in the most stylish homes; designers Luke Edward Hall and Duncan Campbell, food writer Skye McAlpine and fashion designer Hannah Weiland are all fans of her brand. As she releases her first book, Heuman reveals the six key design tenets she takes into every project. Every home should have something sentimental on show, Heuman believes, whether it’s something you’ve had since your childhood or a souvenir picked up on your travels. “The point is not about how it looks,” she says; “it doesn’t have to be beautiful, it could be kitsch, as long as it has personal meaning. I think that is the most important element of a personal home really. It’s got nothing to do with anybody else; it’s just to do with your life and experience. My own home is jam-packed with things that are connected to memories. If I do a scheme for a client and I chance upon something that has sentimental value for them, you see their face soften and they start smiling... I think you can underestimate the power of that. It’s a key ingredient.” The bespoke mural in Heuman’s daughters’ bedroom (above) is a case in point, inspired by the mural in the Bemelmans Bar at the Carlyle Hotel in New York: “I first went there with Nicky [Haslam], while I was working with him, and it was this really special moment, so that mural has a lot of sentimental value to me.”  “If I could give one piece of advice, it’s to make sure you have a floor plan to scale, including all the different types of furniture that you want, before you start buying stuff” says Heuman. “Don’t even think about how it’s going to look, just how it will work practically. If you have that in place it informs what you need and what you should buy.” When it comes to the choosing of furniture stage, she will often make bespoke pieces for clients, and always mixes in vintage and antiques to add personality. For new pieces, “My favourite shops are Soane, they do the most beautiful things, and Pinch.”  “I always like to include something that is not quite of this world; a twisted idea of a known object,” says Heuman. “I think it’s good for the mind and creativity, and it might tap into something that’s imagined, a world you might find in a book. A lot of homes are comfortable and beautiful, but I also think it’s important, especially while we’re stuck at home, to have an environment that’s inspiring and energising.”  Her own product line is centred on pieces that are based on a classical design, but have a slightly surreal twist, such as her Dodo Egg pendant light (which is achieving cult status among the style cognoscenti), with its almost cartoonish feathery plume. “I like including things like that,” says Heuman, “because I think it makes you a little more present in the moment; you’re inspired to think about what it might be or what it might mean, and take in the environment a little bit more.” The finer details of a piece of a room are what elevate it into the extraordinary - and where the skill of a designer such as Heuman really comes into play. “The details enhance the experience of a room,” she says. “For example, in a room with white walls, we might paint the inside of a cupboard pink, so you have little special moments that maybe you don’t discover straight away. The fact you don’t see it immediately makes it like a little message for the person who discovers it.” Bespoke joinery is also an opportunity to add details, such as hand-painted elements and decorative door furniture. “We tend to do our joinery quite simply so that it doesn’t look too heavy, but then we’ll put special handles on it,” says Heuman. “That makes a really big difference, because it’s what you touch all the time; it’s like a bit of jewellery.” Heuman’s modus operandi when creating a palette is to start with a cool off-white base and add judiciously chosen bursts of colour, in paint and furniture. “I like using warmer colours like yellows and reds, but if everything is warm I feel quite weighed down,” she says. “Those colours need to be balanced off with a neutral that has a cooler tone to it. I’m quite into purples and oxblood red at the moment, and I’m using a lot of soft yellow at the moment, a sort of vanilla colour; it’s nice if you don’t want white but you want something neutral with a bit of character.” “Of course you want your home to be the best it can be, you want to aim high, but you also want it to be a true reflection of who you are,” says Heuman. “We always have a mix of old and new, high and low. We’re all a mix of all these different things; that needs to reflect in the environment around you.” A mixed scheme also allows flexibility, and an environment in which the owners can indulge their taste as it changes. “No matter how amazing your home is, it’s completely unrealistic to think that you won’t want anything to change throughout your life,” Heuman points out. “We all need change and variation, we all need something new from time to time, so it’s important to allow for a home that can take being added to and can take change. ""Sometimes in a restaurant or hotel you can go for one look and it’s more about the experience, but personally in a home environment, I don’t think it’s healthy to have this one look that you’re locked into. I like fixed things to look like they’ve been there a long time - like marble, solid wood, things that will last - but I also think it’s important to have a few things that look a bit flighty. You want a bit of everything to allow you to be all these different things.”  "

‘My mum put me on a diet when I was seven. Here’s what I think now’
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/life/mum-put-diet-seven-think-now/,"Eighteen months ago, Betty Kubovy-Weiss was walking down the street in Manhattan when a man came up and tried to talk to her. This being ‘the city’, she just ignored him. ‘You fat bitch,’ he spat. This would be upsetting for anyone, but for Betty, now 17, it’s nothing new. ‘I’ve had people commenting on my weight for half my life,’ she says today. ‘I’ve often been bullied.’ In April 2012, aged just eight, Betty found herself at the centre of an international storm, after an American Vogue article written by her mother Dara-Lynn Weiss, went viral. A year earlier, Betty’s doctor had pronounced her to be ‘obese’ – pointing out she was 4ft 4in, 6st 9lbs, and ‘needed to get some help with her weight’. She even had raised blood pressure. The article detailed what happened over the next year, after Dara-Lynn made what she described in the article as a ‘practical but unconventional and controversial’ decision to put ‘Bea’ (as she called her in print) on a restrictive diet. ‘I once reproachfully deprived Bea of her dinner after learning that her observation of French Heritage Day involved nearly 800 calories of Brie, filet mignon, baguette and chocolate,’ wrote Dara-Lynn. She also admitted grabbing a Starbucks drink from her daughter and pouring it away because the barista had topped it with cream, rather than milk. Bea’s dinners were halved in size, and dessert pretty much banned. At her friends’ parties, she was told she couldn’t have cookies like the rest of the children. There was an immediate outcry. Dara-Lynn was called ‘the most selfish woman ever to grace the magazine’s pages’. She was accused of ‘fat-shaming’, even child abuse. ‘I’m pretty sure Weiss just handed her daughter the roadmap to all her future eating disorders,’ wrote one commentator on a parenting blog. Dara-Lynn had, in fact, wrestled with this precise fear. As she wrote in Vogue: ‘In a culture rife with eating disorders and ominous warnings of how tenuous kids’ self-esteem is, especially among girls, telling [a young girl] that she has to lose weight is not only uncomfortable, it’s almost unimaginable.’ But, warned that Bea was in the 99th percentile, she had proceeded nonetheless. Today, Betty – finally happy to use her real name – is a confident 17-year-old. She starts at Yale in September and hopes to go to law school. Talking from her Greenwich Village bedroom over Zoom on a Tuesday afternoon, she looks like any normal understated teenager, wearing minimal make-up, dressed in a brown jumper with her straight hair parted in the middle. She is very open, and clearly happy to talk. Perhaps surprisingly, she has positive memories of the immediate period after that Vogue article came out. ‘The photo shoot was fun, glamorous,’ she says. ‘I remember tons of people coming up to me at my aunt’s wedding, and telling me how cute I looked. It should have been nice, but instead it was overwhelming. Later in the day, when one distant family friend called me “beautiful”, I burst into tears. It was too much attention on my body, my appearance.’ Betty says she was mostly shielded from the acrimony thrown at her mother in the aftermath of the Vogue piece. Dara-Lynn later followed it up with a book called Heavy – a memoir of the controversy and an examination of how to maintain a  . ‘I knew Mom was being criticised, but at that time I was largely protected from the media situation,’ says Betty. ‘But I do recall her coming back from one TV show interview, taken aback by how aggressively people were confronting her.’ Looking back, Betty has ‘mixed emotions’ about her mother’s decision to share her story with the world. It took her three years to read Heavy, and she still can’t bring herself to read the original Vogue piece. ‘I have never doubted my mom’s good intentions with either the article, the book or the diet itself,’ says Betty. ‘And I did lose 16 pounds in the following year [after starting the diet] because of this healthier eating plan – even though I think a fixation with numbers is generally unhelpful when talking about weight. ‘Both the diet and the book/article had impacts on how I view my weight, but the former definitely more than the latter,’ she says. ‘Honestly, though, it was a combination of a lot of self-reflection, self-empowerment and seeking out people and content that made me feel good about my body that had the most impact on how I see myself [now], not the diet or any changes to my body.’ She now describes her mother as ‘supportive’. ‘Mom still feels that she did the right thing for my health back then. I would certainly be worse off if I hadn’t learnt how to handle my weight and health from a young age. It’s a skill that I’ve continued to develop and have found helpful throughout my adolescence. But she also reflects on what happened, and accepts that things could have gone differently.’ In an interview around the publication of Heavy, Dara-Lynn shared some regrets. ‘I accept a lot of the criticism. I am strict,’ she said. ‘I was abrasive at times, I made a million mistakes. But the idea that I embarrassed or humiliated my child, that’s just wrong. It’s painful to hear.’ (Dara-Lynn was invited to speak to Stella alongside her daughter, but declined, saying she’d said everything she had to say on the subject, but suggested we do a solo interview with Betty instead.) Dara-Lynn has always insisted that her main concern was her daughter’s health. After all, it was Betty’s paediatrician who had originally raised the subject. And it’s a dilemma that increasing numbers of parents are having to wrestle with. According to a 2020 NHS report, one in 10 children in reception year qualified as obese (a BMI of over 30). By year six (10- and 11-year-olds in the last year of primary school) this rose to 20 per cent. Obese children are much more likely to be obese adults, causing significant risks for conditions such as heart disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes, as well as low self-esteem. Add to this the rise in sedentary lifestyles during the Covid pandemic – and the complications added to the disease by being overweight – and the issue becomes more important than ever. ‘Childhood obesity should certainly get attention in the light of increased time at home, more sedentary lifestyles, and greater stress,’ says Betty. ‘That being said, I am much more troubled by the uptick in eating disorders – the most deadly mental illnesses – that we as a society have seen in the past few decades. And that is coming out of that same anxiety about the pandemic. Childhood obesity is certainly an issue that is important to combat and discuss. But that discussion and its inherent perpetuation of diet culture can lead to very damaging consequences. Health should be the goal, of course, but that requires a combination of physical and mental health, both of which are equally important.’ Imagine being a pre-teen schoolgirl while a national controversy is raging about your weight? From the age of four, Betty had attended Hunter College Campus Schools, a New York establishment for educating the ‘gifted and talented’. (Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote Hamilton, is a famous alumnus.) One might expect the pupils there to be less… superficial than at a less academic school. ‘I did not find this to be the case,’ says Betty. ‘The kids were just as vicious, and of course the article didn’t help.’ It was, after all, one of the first things that people knew about her. The hardest time, Betty says, was around seventh grade, when she was 12. ‘I remember my “best friend” joking around saying, “I’ll tell them to roast you like the fat pig that you are.” I was so taken aback,’ she says. ‘My friend just laughed, moved on, and I pretended nothing had happened. These days, I would have asked that girl to deconstruct it, to ask what she meant by that statement. But back then, I had less confidence, and was devastated. It took me a year to leave that friendship.’ In the past 10 years, Betty’s weight has fluctuated, as she’s tried every diet under the sun. While Betty does not explicitly blame her mother for her fixation on her weight, and is very protective of her, she recalls a conversation where Dara-Lynn said to her, ‘Maybe I made you lose too much.’ ‘It’s been a constant struggle,’ says Betty. ‘My confidence hinges so much on how my body feels or looks. I sometimes feel guilty that I feel more confident when I’m smaller. But it remains a fact that I do.’ Perhaps, Betty says, genetics are against her. ‘I’ve always thought of my mom as skinny, but I know she spends a lot of time working on her weight,’ she says. Betty’s father, Itamar – a producer and director – is ‘overweight with high cholesterol and has often been on the verge of diabetes. But he’s not judged in the same way as we women are.’ As she’s got older, she’s become involved with the body-positivity movement, and realised not everyone judges you by your weight. ‘It took me a long time to realise I could be desirable to boys,’ she says. ‘I was convinced that if I was skinnier, I would get more attention. And while I think that girls with the ideal body types do turn more heads, the worthwhile guys don’t care how much I weigh. They like the fact that I am funny and find me attractive regardless of the fact that I’m not super-skinny.’ Returning to her mother’s decision to write about her in Vogue, she says, ‘Control had to be enforced. Imagine your child had cancer, and didn’t want to have chemotherapy. You’d force them, wouldn’t you? I see this as a similar situation. Every parent wants to do the best for their child, and my mother was no exception. I just keep reminding myself of the health aspect,’ says Betty. ‘But, on the other hand I’m against fat-shaming and pro-body positivity. I have clothes I feel good in.’ During lockdown, she has become a fan of Peloton workouts. ‘I feel healthy and strong,’ she says. ‘This whole area is so complicated. I mean, I’ve been taught how to eat healthily, it’s just that often, I choose not to. Food is delicious. Of course I want two slices of cake rather than one shared piece.’ Today, food is no longer a battle at home. ‘Yes, Mom still runs the household, and does most of the cooking, but it’s more of a collaborative process. We choose what to eat together,’ she says, adding, ‘My mother is no longer part of my body-image story.’"

DIY beauty: How to shape eyebrows, remove shellac and more self-care tips for at home
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/body/how-shape-pluck-eyebrows-remove-shellac-diy-beauty-at-home/,"Hairdressers are reopening on July 4, but we'll have to wait a while longer before nail bars and beauty salons reopen. Navigating our beauty regimes for the next few weeks until salons reopen is something we all might need a little help with. Here’s your guide to looking after yourself during  . With so much hand-washing and using hand sanitisers, the skin on our hands needs far more attention than usual. Kim Treacy, a celebrity nail technician, suggests applying a thick layer of the  , and pop some cotton gloves on top. Either leave on overnight, or while you watch a film. “If you don’t have any hand cream and can’t get out to get any, try olive oil,” suggests Treacy. “Pluck the stray hairs first before tackling the shape,” advises Vanita Parti, the founder of Blink Brow Bar. “Brush your brows up and across. You can then determine the core brow shape hair to remove. Just pluck one or two hairs at a time, step away and view your brows before you continue – step by step is key. You may also need to trim the longer brow hairs with nail scissors, so brush up with a brow brush and snip any hairs poking above the brow line.” Parti recommends slanted tweezers, as they are more precise, and “will give you the grip you need to grab each brow hair by the root and minimise hair breakage.” “A pencil is a great tool to define the shape of your brow,” says Parti. “Place the pencil at the edge of your nose and where it hits your eyebrow is where they should be. Then swivel it from your nose to your iris – this is where the arch should be positioned. Finally swivel again from your nose to the end of your eye and where the pencil hits the brow is where they end.” “Always apply a base coat, two thin layers of varnish and a top coat,” Treacy tells me. “On the third day, reapply a top coat and as long as you are not digging the garden your polish should last 8 to 10 days.” Treacy likes to use the  and  . “This will never end well,” says hair stylist Luke Hersheson, “so instead try to change your parting or take this as an opportunity to grow your hair a little. Unless you’ve got a really graphic hairstyle that requires maintenance, grow out your hair a little and stay away from hacking it up. Most hairstyles definitely don’t need to be maintained every 6-8 weeks.” The same goes for men. Hersherson suggests rather than trying to trim your hair, play around with styling it a bit more. His  helps the hair to look sleek without resorting to unforgiving gel and wax products. Hersheson says you should maintain the length of your beard with clippers, but to prevent in-grown hairs with a regular exfoliation. “Mix a spoonful of olive or sunflower oil with some rice flour or semolina to make a paste,” adds facialist Abigail James. “It’s cheap, simple and particularly effective on men’s skin as it’s not too scratchy. “Whatever you do, don’t peel it off,” says Treacy, as this will remove some of your nail layers. Instead, lightly file over the nail to take the shine. Then apply some acetone nail varnish remover on a cotton pad on each nail and wrap with a strip of kitchen foil. “Leave it on for ten minutes,” says Treacy, “and then gently remove the varnish with a cuticle pusher.” “Look for any intensive masks with ceramides or hyaluronic acid in to help repair the epidermal layer,” says Dr David Jack, a Harley Street aesthetic specialist. His  , is packed full of ceramides and also contains azelaic acid which can help to reduce redness and rosacea flare-ups. Men also neglect their skin so this is a good opportunity to work a regular mask into your routine. If you’re in the market for something a little more homemade, James suggests a mask made from an equal measure of yogurt and honey with a pinch of porridge oats. Leave it on the skin for 15 minutes for a boost of hydration. “You can start using active ingredients on a daily basis, but don’t just buy anything too strong,” advises Dr Jack. “You don’t want to strip your epidermal barrier right back. It might be tempting to start using glycolic peels and retinol creams but you need to build up gradually, particularly if your skin is not used to it.” A good routine to start with is using a comfortable vitamin C serum in the morning, such as  , with something nourishing in the evening such as a face oil or hydrating serum. Investing in a silicon LED face mask, which emits red light onto your skin, can really help the skin and stress levels for men and women. “LED has a balancing effect on our bodies, which can benefit us in more ways than one,” says Laura Ferguson, co-founder of The Light Salon. “The lights can help lower cortisol, our stress hormone, and trigger the release of nitric oxide within each cell, our de-stress hormone. Red light also boosts the production of serotonin and dopamine, our happy hormones.” As for your skin, expect a more hydrated, youthful glow with daily use. ( Try the Boost face mask by “Botox and fillers are injected deep into the skin to the muscle and deeper into the fat so it isn’t possible to use anything topically to prolong their life,” Dr Jack advises. “The only thing you can really do is to use good skincare at the moment and stay healthy. There will be time enough to sort out any issues when we are back to normal.” “Use a good quality moisturiser, a concealer and a good mascara,” the make-up artist Adam de Cruz tells me. Warm your moisturiser in your hands by rubbing them together and then properly massage it into the skin to help bring all the blood to the surface.  , is excellent for both men and women. Apply a natural-looking concealer such as the  under your eyes and apply two coats of your favourite mascara. As for lipstick, “apply a balmy, creamy texture with a hint of colour, and look for a multi-purpose product you can use on your lips and cheeks,” says make-up artist Ruby Hammer. Meanwhile “side-parting your hair will look immediately professional,” according to Hersheson.   “There are lots of root touch-up sprays and deep conditioners that will help you fix your colour in for longer,” Hersheson advises. Try the and the   There’s no need to leave a mask on for too long, he adds, as most of the benefits will be achieved in the first 10 minutes. "

Five dishes for the perfect Easter menu
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/best-dishes-perfect-easter-2021-menu-main-dessert/,"Daffodils are in full bloom and the clocks have gone forward; Easter is here and with it comes the promise of lighter evenings, warmer days and (hurrah!) afternoons spent at the pub. But what to have for lunch?  Since many of us will be moving our   feast outside to accommodate a guest or two (gatherings of six have been allowed in private gardens since March 29), we propose a feast of dishes perfect for the dining room or garden table – with   from some of our favourite food writers.  A   is an Easter classic for Diana Henry, stuffed with garlic, lemon and herbs for a robust and flavourful main course. Carve indoors and let everyone help themselves from a platter. Gill Meller's spring vegetable tart can be baked in advance for a tasty vegetarian option, and Darina Allen's cauliflower salad is vibrant and light – plus it won't blow away in the April breeze.  For dessert, Skye McAlpine's joyous lemon meringue pie hits the spot, while Sybil Kapoor's traditional Easter saffron bread will go down a treat with a cup of tea later. And for drinks? You can count on our wine writers to provide tips for a bottle or two,  . Happy Easter, everyone!  'This recipe came about because I couldn’t decide which herb to choose, so I just used several together, and I’ve now been making it for 30 years. The herb paste permeates every bit of the meat.' 'There’s something particularly special about this tart. Yes, it’s absolutely delicious, but its charm goes beyond the crumbly pastry and rich custard. For me it feels special because it represents a real change in the seasons. It encapsulates springtime cooking and all the good green joy that comes with it.' 'Crunchy cauliflower, Romanesco or calabrese would be delicious raw in this fresh salad. Or you could drizzle over extra-virgin olive oil and roast at 230C/210C fan/gas mark 8 for 10-12 minutes, or until slightly charred at the edges. Use more freekeh for a more substantial salad.' 'Saffron bread dates back to the late 15th or early 16th century, when a savoury version of it was baked as pre-Lenten bread. Later, sugar, spices, currants and sometimes rose water were added, and it became associated with Easter in the West Country. It can be eaten fresh with clotted cream or toasted with lots of butter.' 'Everything about this is joyful, from the clouds of soft meringue to the rich yellow curd and the crumbly, buttery base. You could, of course, buy a good lemon curd, but this recipe, adapted from the brilliant 1950s book ‘Artistry in Cold Food Preparation’, tastes so above and beyond anything you can buy that it is worth that marginal extra effort.'  "

43 of the best online fashion sites that offer home delivery  
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/shopping/best-online-fashion-websites-clothes-shopping-home-delivery/,"Since lockdown 3.0 non-essential shops have remained closed, meaning a day of retail therapy has been off the cards for months. Here are the best fashion websites to shop online instead, while you're stuck at home and waiting for your next shopping spree on April 12... The latest launch from the H&M group, Arket is just what the British high street was missing. Grown up clothes that we want to wear and that don’t cost the Earth. Think of it as an everyman’s Joseph. Sustainability and social responsibility are king at Arket, and you will see each item has full listings of the fabrics (and how each fabric is made), supplier and factory. Arket’s return policy has currently been extended to 100 days. Founded by ex-fashion editor Lily Russo and her sister, this online-only shop will have you looking ahead to sunnier times. With an edit of “of-the-moment” swimwear brands its every influencer's paradise.  By Far sprung onto the fashion scene with its now much-copied Victoria-style lace up boots. It's swiftly become a mecca thanks to its offering of well made, well designed shoes that sit somewhere between high end and high street. By Far are currently offering 25% off all collections and free worldwide shipping (inc taxes and duties) Cos has become synonymous with minimal, sculptural Scandinavian style, but it’s one of those shops that many struggle to buy from. Why? Because the clothes are often so complex, or have boxy cuts, and so lack ‘hanger appeal’. The website takes a lot of the leg-work out of shopping at Cos as you can see what they look like ‘on the body’ without having to go through the rigmarole of trying them on yourself.  Couverture is the neighbourhood store you’ve always dreamt of. Under-the-radar brands hand selected by founder Emily Dyson fill the no-frills website; current favourites include New Delhi-based Laite Works, ‘slow fashion’ label Story MFG and Spanish jewller Helena Rohner. Its gifting selection, and homewares, are worth a look. Fashion’s latest contender in the resale market, Depop is a peer-to-peer platform for those wanting to sell pre-loved pieces. Aimed at younger shoppers it's all about how you style it out; hard-to-find streetwear, retro sportswear and designer gear are the most sought after items. Laden with bucolic imagery, Los Angeles-based Doen greets you like a friendly hug. Prairie dresses, wholesome mother-and-daughter photos and beautiful printed clothing. There is nothing twee about Doen; its vintage-cut pieces are styled with just enough sexiness to make sure they don't look frumpy. You can choose to pre-pay all duties and taxes at checkout.  One man’s trash is another man’s treasure, and this is no truer than on eBay. Set alerts and reminders for items you’re after, use the ‘Auction’ filter to whittle down items and always, always be sure to read the description and check the measurements carefully before bidding! Everlane leads the charge when it comes to sustainability on the digital high street. Each piece comes with ‘transparent pricing’ where they outline the cost breakdown to produce items. Like Arket, it lists the factory where individual pieces are made, along with a short biography, information on how Everlane found the factory and images from inside. Be warned, taxes and local duties are applied at checkout Etsy is the home of homemade and small producers. You’ll need to be specific with search terms (don’t come here if you’re looking just to browse), and be willing to trawl, but good things come to those who wait. Be sure to bookmark your favourite sellers and be wary of where items are being sent from as they can incur large shipping fees, long delivery times and high import duties. If you can still stomach it, you’ll find some absolute gems Part of the company that owns Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters, Free People’s flippy, bohemian aesthetic plays out across the brand’s website. It stocks both ‘own brand’ pieces (great swimwear, and a huge selection of dresses) and a host of other designers including Antik Batik, Alice McCall and Endless Summer. With its retail stores currently closed, the website is currently the only way to shop Free People. J Crew’s stores only offer a small percentage of it stock. The website on the other hand has the full array as well as a great permanent sale section (NB always filter by size first!). The imagery on the site is great for a bit of uplifting, all-American cheer. Note, returns are not free, nor straightforward but have been extended to 60 days. Achingly cool Joan the Store digitally embodies the spirit of East London. The gritty imagery offsets the sometimes kitsch selection of pieces and a tight, concise edit means there isn't masses to trawl through. Come here for offbeat but beautiful investment purchases One of the pioneers in ‘direct to consumer’ digital shopping, Kitri has swiftly become a secret weapon for the fashion world. It offers great dresses, limited runs of products and new drops every week. Free 2-3 day delivery and free returns are available on orders over £45, because “life is stressful enough”. With a very clear aesthetic - grown-up bohemian, but not too ‘incense sticks’ - KJ’s Laundry can be a Marmite store. We love it. With a mix of hard to come by brands, its own label and a large selection of the enormously popular Samantha Sung shirt dresses, if this is your bag, you’ll be adding everything to basket. A store with a sense of humour, Koi Bird aims to bring an element of international discovery and joy back into shopping. With themed edits that change seasonally (from its ‘core’ ski and swim, it has also shone a spotlight on California and Korea, while currently championing ‘Lagos Fashion Week’), Koi Bird is anything but boring. Even if you’re not in need of anything, it's worth checking out as the edit is sure to bring a smile to your face. For London-based customers, KOI Bird is offering a home courier delivery service or stylists can do video personal shopping calls showing you products you are interested in. After a burst of sunshine in your wardrobe? Look no further than La Double J. Founded by journalist JJ Martin, the Milan-based brand is all about print, pattern and positivity. The collection which started off just as dresses and skirts now includes knitwear, some fabulous swimwear and great homeware to boot. French powerhouse La Redoute can sometimes go forgotten but you’ve got time to trawl there are some real gems there. Its collection designed by Vanessa Seward (the second drop is currently online) is wonderful and the homewares and children's clothes are worth look. too. Try to imagine an online, fashion- and  design-led concept store, and you’ll come somewhere close to LNCC. Offering quirky, cult designer brands - think Rick Owens, Martine Rose and Off-White - this is the site for those searching for key designer pieces.  Many Americans swear by Madewell for its denim and the website has a great guide to buying jeans. Most come in sizes 23-37 and with clear measurement and stretch-guidance for each style. The site - refreshingly, and sadly unusually - shows most pairs of jeans on 3 different model sizes. Similar to J Crew (part of the same parent company), returns are not as easy as one would hope.  The jewel in the crown on the high street at the moment, but Mango’s brick-and-mortar stores leave a lot to be desired. The website, on the other hand, has the full range of product, and is currently offering free delivery or orders over £30 and a 60 day returns window. Its sale site ( ) is also worth a peruse.  Another of the luxury “biggies”, Matchesfashion.com stocks over 450 brands and ships to 176 countries. Originally a bricks-and-mortar store, the owners were quick to adopt e-commerce in 2007. Now over 95% of Matchesfashion.com’s sales are done online; not altogether surprising as the online styling service is faultless, items arrive in beautiful marbled packaging and for some postcodes you can receive your order within 90 minutes. Returns are done through DHL so no need to leave the house.  Miista, and its sister brand E8, fills a gap in the footwear market. With just enough ‘design’ that they feel like something special, but not to the extent that you can only wear them for special occasions. They're the type of shoe that people will stop you and ask where they're from (which is how I learnt about the brand). In light of Covid-19, it is extending its return period by 28 days. Germany's answer to Net-a-Porter, MyTheresa stocks many of the same designers as its UK competitors. The difference? Their ‘buy’ (ie the items they choose to stock from each brand) is quite different from Net-a-Porter and Matches, so you can snap up something different to everyone else. For items stocked across many of the multi-brand retailers, it is worthwhile cross-referincing prices with international counterparts as they can vary quite substantially. MyTheresa offers 2-3 business shipping for £10 (free to orders over £500). Net a Porter is the original luxury online retailer. It offers every designer label you can think of, plus plenty of smaller brands and a huge selection of items covering “It” bags, fine jewellery, beauty and a large sustainability capsule collection. It is currently offering 15% off new-season styles and same day delivery (on orders placed before 2pm) for London postcodes. Olive has quite the following on Instagram, and it's not hard to see why. Easy to wear, well-priced pieces made - on the whole - from natural fibres. Most of the items are sold as ‘one size’ (this is how it is able to keep the prices down), so it won't work for those over a size 12/14.  Spanish brand Oysho is lesser known in the UK as it doesn't have physical stores. It specialises in underwear, sportswear and swimwear at great prices. The sizing comes up a little small but it is currently offering free delivery and returns until 3rd April so best to order multiple sizes to find the perfect fit. Both a catalogue and online store, Plumo holds a place in many shoppers’ hearts. Selling a mix of  independent designers, fair trade goods and artisan fashion, Plumo does not follow trends but instead has its own clear style; part librarian, part South-of-France-chic. The sale section of the site is great, as season-less and trend-less style means items might be marked-down, but not out of fashion. Plumo has free delivery on all UK orders. A luxury platform for sustainable and ethical goods, Reve en Vert is as much an online store as it is a digital community. It wants you to not only shop but to “engage in the creation of a better world, and to make consumer choices that are in harmony with its natural balance.” With a brand list that reads like a who’s who of sustainable fashion, and a tight edit of items, it offers both style and substance.   Riley Studio might just be what we’re all wanting to wear right now. The aim to make conscious consumerism the norm by designing long lasting clothing made largely from recycled or waste products. The clothing is intended to be genderless and looks good while also doing good. French It girl Jeanne Damas has frequently been called the 21st century’s answer to Brigitte Bardot. Beautiful, nonchalant and impeccably dressed, the model-turned-actress now lets you buy into her style with Rouje. With the perfect jeans, easy broderie anglaise blouses and the perfect summer dress you too can have that South of France style at the click of a button. The returns period has currently been extended. For years, Sezane was the secret weapon of the chic Parisian set. Having launched in the UK a few years ago, it now offers well priced, well made items with that bit of  . Currently it is offering free delivery, and extended returns period and 10% of all proceeds will be donated to the emergency funds to set up French hospitals. Bravo!   Often misunderstood as only stocking childrens’ clothes and toys, Smallable sells a huge assortment of hand-selected, independent womenswear designers all roughly in the £50-£300 category. Favourite brands include Spanish footwear label LOQ, Tinsels which sells classic French design and mother-and-baby label Poudre Organic. The site also has a brilliant ‘teen’ section for those difficult years. At the moment, Smallable’s returns period has been extended to 60 days. SSence (pronounced ‘essence’) stocks all the major international designer brands, with a buy that is aimed largely at millenials. It also has a great selection of ‘contemporary’ brands (ie affordable designer brands) such as See by Chloe, Tibi, and some lesser known labels including Julia Heuer.  The Dreslyn is nirvana for minimalists, and sadly there is nothing like it in the UK, so we have to look across the pond. Don't expect bold prints or bright colours; instead you’ll find a neutral palette, fluid shapes and clean lines. That applies to its clothing, homewares and beauty too. Be wary of shipping costs and import duties when ordering.   The discounted sister of Net-a-Porter, The Outnet gives you a luxury shopping experience but at a discounted price. Don't be fooled into thinking items are cheap, they’re not. They're just not as expensive as they once were. Its own label, Iris & Ink, does great basics.  Most aren’t aware that high street favourite TK Maxx has a digital store. Avoid rummaging by heading online and filtering by size, price and category. Looking for a real bargain? Its Gold Label section is knock-out, with Bottega Veneta, Prada and Valentino all currently up to 80% off.  A go-to for any magpie in the know, Tomfoolery has one of the best selections of jewellery available online. From engagement rings to self-gifting, statement pieces to everyday wear, the north London-based brand champions up and coming designers - a great way to support small brands. As jewellery can be a high value purchase, Tomfoolery offers a ‘home try on service’  Everyone’s favourite designer resale site, Vestiaire is the place to blag a bargain. Scour the site for vintage pieces, never been worn items, or the ones that you regret not buying first time round. It is also easy to sell your own pieces on the site, with a simple to follow uploading guide. Great for under the radar independent brands, Wolf & Badger offers something for everyone. While it doesn't have the polish of some of the larger multi-brand retailers, its price point is far kinder on the purse. A wonderful website for discovery. Enormous on the continent, for some reason or another Yoox has never made huge inroads into the UK market. Selling old season stock at a fraction of the original price, this site is a hidden gem. Go straight to the ‘Sale’ section and filter by size. We prefer to avoid the shouty seasonal ‘must have’ pieces but instead go for classics: black trousers, trench coat, court shoes anyone? Covering everything from high-street to high-end, Zalando is a one-stop-shop for all your fashion needs. Boasting more brands than any other fashion retailer, it stocks Miss Selfridge to Mulberry and everything in between. Useful filters, such as ‘neckline’, ‘sleeve length’ and ‘material’ make editing the huge offering simple.

7 pieces which will upgrade your 'working from home' wardrobe 
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/7-pieces-will-upgrade-working-home-wardrobe/,"Bored of wearing the same old grey jogging bottoms each day as your working-from-home look? Here are seven key pieces that could switch up your outfits without sacrificing comfort... Fine-knit polo tops became a new season ‘must-have’ after they were spotted in the Prada spring 2020 catwalk show, but they also make great working-from-home attire. The polo knit is soft and stretchy, like a jumper, but the collar and buttoned neckline make it just that little bit more formal-looking. There are many great colours to be found on the high street; & Other Stories has pastels, neutrals and bold hues in its online edit.  A coordinated tracksuit is an obvious clothing choice for most at-home workers. Why not try a T-shirt and skirt co-ord, in a similar soft fabric, instead? Me&Em’s ‘AM-PM’ set features a relaxed jersey top and a pleated skirt with a wide elasticated waistband. The dark olive colour is versatile, too, meaning you could break the set apart and integrate the pieces easily with everything else in your wardrobe. Cheering knitwear will make you feel good - and look good on the seemingly-endless video conference calls. There are many British ‘It’ knitwear brands, from Chinti and Parker to Bella Freud, whose colourful cashmere jumpers can cost hundreds of pounds. The designer Madeleine Thompson, however, has just released a new collaboration with Next’s Label Mix range, meaning that versions of her rainbow jumpers (typically £300+) can now be bought on the high street for a fraction of the price. If your current trousers of choice are either leggings or jogging bottoms, do consider this third option for your repertoire. Wide leg joggers look smarter than traditional styles that are cuffed at the ankle, but are no less soft and comfy with the same elasticated waistbands. In full or cropped lengths, the thicker jersey material looks structured and holds its shape well, reading more like an office-suitable trouser than loungewear. On the high street, COS has a great selection in tailoring-look materials (on first glance, the trousers pictured above do  look like joggers, but they are!) while  in several colours, currently on sale with 40% off.    Not to be confused with a onesie, you can find some great casual jumpsuits on the high street in materials that are not toweling. Steer clear of boilersuits, anything labelled 'utility' or anything in denim fabrics, as these will not be as comfortable. French Connection’s printed jumpsuit here has a draped collar neckline and flattering waist belt (features which ensure that it doesn’t look like sleepwear) but the fabric is jersey meaning it will be soft to wear. A cardigan with buttons running up to a higher crew neck will always look smarter than one which is looser and done up at the waist. There’s something about seeing a line of buttons which instantly looks more pulled together - even if ultimately you’re still just wearing knitwear. Boden’s Eldon cardigan comes in a spectrum of joy-bringing colours. Finally, if nothing else, you could put on some statement earrings to add interest to your next video-conference look. They don’t have to be expensive; any flash of colour, or interesting shape, is enough to make you look like you’ve made an effort, you’re well, and you're cheerful. The little things can make a big difference to your own confidence and happiness - as well as the impression you will give to the person on the other end of the web-call.  "

Three of the best spring baking recipes to try this weekend
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/three-best-spring-baking-recipes-try-cakes-make-weekend/,"There are few things as enjoyable as spending time in the kitchen making a cake or a few scones. The simple act of baking engenders a sense of happiness. Over the years, I have cooked in many different kitchens, from the cool Victorian rectory kitchen of my childhood, with its huge painted dresser and north-facing windows, to my current urban basement kitchen, all German minimalism with clean lines and soft light. In between, I’ve experienced everything from gleaming stainless-steel restaurant kitchens to bedsits with little more than a Baby Belling, kettle and sink. No matter how small the space, I step into another world when I bake – a sensation that I suspect is familiar to many cooks. Maybe it is the peculiar mix of precision and creativity that baking demands which takes you into another zone. As your hands are exercised by practical tasks such as beating or kneading, your mind drifts away on the currents of evocative smells. I can be in London on a hot summer’s day, but if I whip up the strawberry cream cake my mother used to make for my father’s birthday, I find myself back in a rural English garden, transported by the sweet scent of sugared sponge and ripe strawberries. These three recipes conjure up the scents and tastes of spring – and a weekend spent baking one if not all of them is guaranteed to make you smile. Traditionally, the sponge is unflavoured and filled with raspberry jam or lemon curd; this is a more luxurious, buttery lemon version. The house will fill with the scent of honey as you bake this. It is from the National Trust’s Buckland Abbey in Devon. They’ve reintroduced bees to the estate, continuing the monastic tradition of keeping hives in orchards, so depending on the season, it might be infused with lime- or bramble-blossom honey. These delicious eclairs are best eaten on the day they’re made. You can also chill and eat them the next day – they’ll be a bit softer. If you wish, replace the kirsch with crème de violette, which can be found in some specialist drink shops. Alternatively, you can flavour the cream with the finely grated zest of an orange – or simply use plain whipped cream. You can buy crystallised violets from specialist delicatessens and online baking shops."

Tried and tested: the sleep gadgets that promise to cure your 'coronasomnia'
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/technology/tried-tested-sleep-gadgets-promise-cure-coronasomnia/,"A study by University of Southampton last year showed that the number of people in the UK experiencing insomnia rose from one in six in 2019 to one in four in April 2020 alone. One year on, the word “insomnia” has been Googled more frequently than ever before and experts have dubbed this Covid-induced lack of sleep ‘coronasomnia'. But there are ways to fight back - what follows are the sleep gadgets that left the   team feeling refreshed and restored in recent mornings.  After an extended period struggling to react to my 7am alarm, I was keen, if a little skeptical, to try the Tech Bar Pegasi Smart Sleep Glasses. But, the science is simple. The human body is programmed to wake at sunrise and sleep when it gets dark. Different colours of light are said to have different effects on mood and energy, with blue and green light bringing on the natural cortisol hit that gently wakes us up and keeps us alert. By deliberately exposing ourselves to certain light at certain times, it is said that we can reset our body clocks. The Pegasi glasses themselves are small, unobtrusive, sturdy and easy to use. Switching on at the touch of a button, and off automatically after a session, the glasses can be paired to an app, but work perfectly well without. Sitting just below the eyebrows, and worn for 30 minutes a day between 7 and 9am, a green light is directed downwards towards the eyes After a week of wear, I still go to bed too late, but now sleep right through every night and wake up feeling happier.  One of the biggest struggles I’ve come across working from home this year is making sure I get up in the morning at a regular time. Enter Joy Resolve, makers of The Barisieur, a beautifully designed coffee maker alarm clock that wakes you up with a freshly brewed tea or coffee.  Once you have set the time and alarm, all there is left to do is set up the coffee station. Water, coffee and some milk (that is kept cold by the built in cooling system). At 6:55am I was awoken by a gurgling noise; by the time my alarm went off I was fully awake; and by 7:02am I had a fresh coffee in hand. The small cup is just enough for the first hit of caffeine and the process of the coffee dripping through the test-tube like mechanisms makes for fun viewing. It will also continue to freshly brew coffee throughout the day at a press of a button.   I’m one of those people who has to listen to something before falling asleep. My nights alternate between podcasts, music, meditation and ASMR. So, incorporating the Kokoon headphones (that come with a travel case and eye mask) into my daily schedule didn’t require a dramatic change. These comfortable noise cancelling headphones are designed to wear throughout the night, so not only does it aid you in falling asleep, but it helps you remain in your slumber - all while monitoring your 'sleep health' (thanks to clever functions such as EEG brainwave sensors) which it provides to you as easy to read data. While falling asleep, you can listen to a background sound of your choice (such as a cool breeze) and audio can be played over it either from the Kookon app or from integrated libraries such as Spotify and Audible. When you fall asleep, the device switches automatically to white noise or turns off completely, depending on the presets you applied in the app.  As a born-and-bred Londoner, Dyson’s Air Purifier seemed surplus to needs. I’ve managed to sleep thus far surrounded by polluted air, so why change the habit of a lifetime? I stand corrected. The quiet desktop-sized purifier captures ‘nasties’ while also blowing out cool air: nighttime hayfever, be gone. What's more, I am sleeping deeper and longer than before. The fan, while quiet, has a gentle hum, adding an unintended element of relaxing white noise, too.  Hot from Finland comes the Neurosonic Wave mattress. This isn’t something you sleep on at night, but a place to crash for 10 minutes during the day, every other day. It is said to allay symptoms of stress and promote deeper sleep. The chic grey wool mattress comes with headphones and a tablet and plays meditative music. But the key to its success are the in-built sinusoidal vibration elements that keep your body gently shuddering as you lie there. The idea comes from an American endocrinologist, Robert Sapolsky, who posed the question ‘Why don’t Zebras get ulcers?’ in a 1994 book. He realised that when a zebra escapes, say, a crocodile at a watering hole, it literally brushes off the trauma with a shake of its body. He reasoned that if we could do the same, we’d all calm down. I paraphrase.  I’ve only been trialling it a few days so can’t be sure I’m sleeping better. But it is a very relaxing spot to zone out: like lying on a gigantic purring cat. The stress comes from the fact that the whole family wants a go and you are liable to have your turn curtailed by a thumping great teen. But that’s only in my house.  The mattresses are popular in NHS hospitals with doctors and nurses taking 10 minutes out to decompress. Athletes also find it helps recovery from injury by promoting blood flow. And Couch Potato Company, that sells it in the UK, reports a rise in demand for the mattress by 20 per cent since this round of lockdowns.  They might look like Star Trek fan fodder but these simple, lightweight ‘glasses’ offer a priceless energy zing. When worn, blue light will automatically switch on for 20 minutes, harnessing the ‘power of circadian light’ to naturally help your brain and body feel more awake. Weighing just one ounce, they helpfully don’t obstruct vision, meaning you can potter around. First results are said to show in two-to-five days but I feel more awake from first use and, the more days in, the better it gets. A handy, low effort morning boost in these final lockdown weeks.  These modular, flat, hexagonal-shaped LED light panels click together to form amazing honeycomb-like patterns you can stick to your wall using magically non-wall-harming adhesive pads. They come in starter packs of four or nine, which you can click together in any shape you fancy. While each pack comes with a physical controller, the idea is you download an app and use your phone to create different colour patterns on your hexagons. The app gives you access to thousands of different colour shades and features both pre-set colour patterns and a studio for creating your own, so you can create flickering firelight or other soothing colours that fade gradually into darkness. And there’s even a rhythm module to sync the lighting with your voice or favourite chill-out music.  While Foreo’s smart mask device, the UFO 2, is designed to be used at any time of day, it can be very handy at night with the Call It A Night UFO-Activated Mask from the same brand. The mask is formulated with olive oil and ginseng and is said to be deeply nourishing. Instead of slathering it on your skin as with a standard face mask, you clip this one - which is like a thin pad - inside the UFO 2 sonic powered controller and let it do the work for you.  The 90-second app-controlled treatment whizzes through LED light therapy, Thermo-Therapy (heating), Cryo-Therapy (cooling) and T-sonic pulsations (for a supple complexion), giving the whole ordeal a spa-like quality which I complemented by spraying my bed with  .  This handy app has been proven to reduce stress by a third after 30 days of use. I have been using the app for five months and have found it has contributed to a feeling of zen, which has naturally fostered better sleep. While meditation has always been a part of my life, using an app encouraged me to incorporate it into my daily routine (the 10 minute sessions are great for busy days) without a fuss. Headspace has other options for sleep-searchers who are looking for an alternative to meditation, says William Fowler, Director of Content. This includes sleep casts (“a narrator carefully describes relaxing landscapes to help people visualise a comfortable, safe place”), sleep music (“designed to help members unwind and create healthy conditions for a restful night of sleep”) and animation (“New techniques and animations are unlocked as you progress through the app”). Sleek LA-born luxe athleisure brand Alo Yoga has created a streaming home wellness service that will be godsend to anyone who finds it hard to stay relaxed during the pandemic. The website and app offer recorded classes from world-renowned instructors for different types of yoga, meditation and other forms of fitness. It gives you the opportunity to pick a level, duration and instructor to suit your personal needs. I tend to use Alo Moves twice throughout my day, once in the morning for a yoga class (Ashley Galvin is my go-to trainer) and in the middle of a day or the evening for relaxation (Phyllicia Bonanno’s Chakra Sound Bath series is my favourite wind down). These keep me level-headed throughout the day, stress-free and, consequently, calm enough to get a good night's sleep. "

Meet the 'Flob': the easy new hair style which suits everyone 
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/hair/meet-flob-easy-new-hair-style-suits-everyone/,"There’s a good reason the bob has been going strong for the best part of a century. Ever since Louise Brooks debuted her raven Cleopatra-esque signature circa 1926 it has been an emblem of independent-minded women. Part of the bob’s free-spirited aura derives from its air of low-maintenance androgyny. It’s the epitome of fuss-free simplicity. How ironic, then, that it can be so high-maintenance, requiring precision cutting and, in some cases, daily blow dries. I should know. I’ve had one most of my adult life. Some days are great. Other days, hide. From Vidal Sassoon’s five-point bob – a synthesis of geometry and rebelliousness that’s as iconic a feature of 1960s British design ingenuity as the Mini car and the mini skirt – to Anna Wintour’s professionally blow-dried (every day) bob to the Pob, that draconian bob popularised by Victoria Beckham before her fashion make-under, bobs can be unforgiving beasts. But now there’s a new bob we can all embrace because, in the spirit of the times, it’s far more inclusive and less demanding than bobs of old. If you can’t get to the salon for a regular blow-dry to smooth it down, no problem. It’s not meant to be smooth. George Northwood, a master of understated, cool-looking cuts and the man responsible for Alexa Chung and Meghan’s hair, is calling it the Flob (the flat-ironed bob) and he predicts it will be the cut of 2021. It suits every age, he says. Unlike traditional bobs, which can be quite harsh and require a firm jawline, the Flob relies less on precision snipping and more on a light, feathery shaping that the stylist adapts depending on face shape. “The idea is to create a lightness around the face and it can be worn short, just below the cheekbones, or almost down to the shoulder line. The cut is a very classic shape, one length all over. If you have a thicker hair type you can ask your stylist to make it a bit choppier, which will add texture and movement. This might not be necessary for finer hair types. Then, styling the wave with a flat iron will really deconstruct the cut, giving it an androgynous, 1990s feel. Think of that cool, undone Calvin Klein 1990s campaign ad vibe.” Unlike razor-sharp bobs, it’s incident-proof. If, for whatever reason, you don’t make it to your next cut for months, it should still look good. It doesn’t come without some effort. You’ll need to blow-dry it to a reasonably smooth finish and use irons. We’re not talking about the ubiquitous ribbon curl but something more natural-looking. “Ribbon curls can make bobs look too full and bouncy, widening the face and making a bob shorter than was intended,” says Northwood. “The idea with this is to create a flat wave that adds light, texture and shape. “Apply some holding spray. Using flat irons or straighteners, start about an inch from the root, aiming the tongs downwards for a few seconds. Slide the irons from root to tips in a gentle zigzag motion, ensuring you create a bevill effect when you reach the ends. It shouldn’t look like a curl but an idealised just-got-out-of-bed effect. If you have very thick hair, start with the underneath sections and work outwards. If you can’t reach bits or can’t see them then don’t style them.” The Flob is the bob at its softest and most forgiving."

The men of the royal household are right: posh slippers are the chicest way to sit out lockdown
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/mens-style/men-royal-household-right-posh-slippers-chicest-way-sit-lockdown/,"We’ve all gotten used to a more sedate way of dressing over this past year, so it’s heartening to know that even the most stately amongst us have hung up their formal attire for something more cosy. Prince Charles’ favourite shoemaker,  , has seen a huge uptick in its handsome slippers over more formal footwear varieties such as Oxford or monk strap shoes, since the house launched its e-commerce platform last month.  “We saw an immediate spike for slippers. One in three pairs of shoes sold were slippers, which is completely unprecedented but clearly an indication that our clients are making the most of the final days of lockdown,” says Marketing Director James Fox.  So have any orders been shipped to Highgrove? As Royal Warrant Holders, the brand is far too discreet to say, but it’s well known that the Prince of Wales is a fan of Crockett & Jones. In 2013, he paid a visit to its factory in Northampton, and is a vocal supporter of British manufacturing. The house, founded in 1879, is a custodian of shoemaking craft and employs some 30-something artisans to hand-make its shoes using techniques passed down from the decades - it's an approach that the royal has been an advocate of for years.  What we do know for certain is that a penchant for debonair slippers runs in the family. Although we tend to think of the royal men in their formal regalia, Prince William has been fond of slippers for a while now. At various events, in the time before Covid, the Duke of Cambridge has opted for a plush, black cashmere pair courtesy of London-based slipper specialist Arthur Sleep, most notably when he donned them with a  .  And while history doesn’t look upon him all that fondly (and the harsh would say that his sense of duty certainly palls in comparison with that of Prince Charles and Prince William), the Duke of Windsor was the original royal dandy. Alongside his heritage suits and peacocking summer attire, Prince Edward VIII was no stranger to a raffish pair of slippers.  He referred to his approach to style as ‘Dress Soft’ - that is, formal with the hard edges smoothed off somewhat - and rare photographs of the dressing rooms at his Paris abode reveal rack upon rack of evening slippers; monogrammed pairs in cherry red, as well as glossy patent black and ones with ornate, 18th-century buckles.  Of course, these are not the tufted, shearling-lined, indoors-only kind of slippers made for lockdown pottering. Crockett & Jones’ simplest pair - the Plain Albert - costs £230 while at Arthur Sleep varieties range from jewel-toned opera pumps to ornate, tapestry embroidered affairs. But, as a completely biased slipper aficionado myself, I can confirm that they do add a sense of ceremony to lockdown cocktail hour. They’re soft, but with enough richness in terms of detail - whether in simple black velvet or something more ornate, to feel special. No matter your royal pedigree, we could all use that a year into the pandemic. "

There’s a structured black dress by Celine that I feel great in. It’s perfect for my shape and I have worn it many times, either when I have spoken in public or hosted events. A certain power comes through when you feel confident in what you are wearing. 
I always feel my most confident when wearing a beautifully tailored blazer. My favourite is the Totême oversized blazer in black. The sentimental value it holds comes from wearing it to some of my most exciting business meetings from my career to date."

This stunning new hideaway ten minutes from Cannes is the most exclusive holiday rental in the Med
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/society/stunning-new-hideaway-ten-minutes-cannes-exclusive-holiday-rental/,"There's an iconic image by the photographer Lee Miller called  . She took it in 1937, and it captures the wild spirit of the island of Sainte-Marguerite off the Côte d'Azur. In the picture, Miller's lover, the surrealist artist Roland Penrose; the poet Paul Eluard and his artist wife, Nusch; Miller's former lover, the artist Man Ray, and his new partner, the dancer Adrienne ('Ady') Fidelin, all recline, in the manner of Monet's  , on floor cushions around a low picnic table. Their bodies are bathed in the dappled light of eucalyptus trees; the women are topless. It is thought that this bohemian group was staying, along with their friend Picasso, at the Hôtel Vaste Horizon in Mougins, above Cannes, at the time. This was the summer Miller first shot Picasso, and Picasso first painted Miller. The two almost certainly became romantically involved in those heady months, according to Miller and Penrose's son, Antony. You can almost feel that Mediterranean heat rising off the black-and-white image, taste the salt in your hair and hear the sparring, flirty banter. It all feels raw, exciting and inimitably glamorous. Like Sainte-Marguerite itself. At just under two miles long, Sainte-Marguerite is the largest of four islands in the Lérins archipelago, about half a mile off the French Mediterranean coast. It is famed for its unspoilt beauty. Another avant-garde artist and Mougins resident, Francis Picabia, equally beguiled by the island's extraordinary flora, fauna and light, would capture its rugged coastline the following year in his painting  . Considering how close it is to the densely cluttered Promenade de la Croisette across the water - Cannes is a 10-minute speedboat ride away - the car-free island feels remarkably removed from it all. On the south side of the island is Le Grand Jardin, a walled private estate whose previous owners have included the 15th century Dukes of Guise and Louis XIV, the Sun King. Last year it was bought by Frenchman Max-Hervé George and his Swiss childhood friend and business partner Byron Baciocchi, the two young real-estate entrepreneurs behind  , a small group of exceptional homes from home - including hotels, villas and ski chalets from Corfu to Megève. As we speak, they are restoring Le Grand Jardin to relaunch this summer as what could well be the most stunning exclusive-use holiday rental on the Côte d'Azur. Both are now in their early 30s. George, whom I met for a coffee last summer just after the purchase went through, could pass for a well-groomed deckhand on a posh yacht in St Tropez - if it weren't for his sharp suit and breezy confidence, both of which could be attributed to the fact that he started investing in property in his early 20s and has done terribly, terribly well out of it. ""Le Grand Jardin is the perfect addition to our collection,"" he told me. ""It offers complete privacy while being in the middle of it all."" Ultima's 'thing' is to ensure that clients feel they are enjoying the best of every world possible. And at a time when the desire for exclusivity has never been stronger, along with the need to reconnect with nature, they have been developing hotels and villas that feel like luxurious, safe, private homes with five-star hotel service. ""Legend has it that Napoleon grazed his horses in the gardens while on the island building furnaces to create cannonballs, which would then be fired at passing ships,"" says Ultima's managing partner, Michala Chatel. ""It's in Cannes, but on its own island. You can't beat that. It is in a different league to anything else on the Côte d'Azur."" Sainte-Marguerite isn't actually a private island at all: it is popular with in-the-know day trippers. But there are no hotels, and the walled estate, covering three-and- a-half acres, is the only place to stay. Most visitors to Ile Sainte-Marguerite arrive by private yacht, dropping anchor in one of its many secluded coves to snorkel in turquoise waters and scamper around its sandy beaches. But there's also a little ferry that potters back and forth from Cannes between April and October, for those wishing to spend a few hours hiking through its forest of umbrella pine and eucalyptus to find that perfect (topless) picnic spot. Last year, British artist Jason deCaires Taylor installed an underwater sculpture garden featuring Easter Island-like heads of local characters, just off the coast of Le Grand Jardin. On the island's north side, near the public jetty, there's a tiny settlement of rustic fishermen's dwellings, a little boatyard and the infamous Fort Royal prison, now a maritime museum. Here, you'll find treasures salvaged from Roman and Saracen shipwrecks, and prison cells still intact. Built in the 1620s, originally to block sea access to Cannes, it was here that the mysterious Man in the Iron Mask was incarcerated. To this day, the prisoner's crime and identity remain undiscovered - though the man himself certainly existed and was locked up from 1669 to his death in 1703, spending 11 of those years in Fort Royal. Historians and writers have woven stories around him. Voltaire believed he was the older, illegitimate brother of Louis XIV. Alexandre Dumas portrayed him as Louis XIV's identical twin, imprisoned to prevent dynastic feuding. We will never know, but it's fun to speculate. Aside from the rich material to furnish plots of your new novel, a major boon for residents of Le Grand Jardin will be its proximity to La Guérite, one of the island's two restaurants. This al-fresco haunt is among the most talked-about dining spots on the Côte d'Azur, with recent sightings including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, as well as the entire Beckham clan, who sailed over to lunch there with Elton John and David Furnish. All this activity is on the north, Cannes-facing side of the island. Hidden away peacefully on the south side, opposite the much smaller island of Saint-Honorat, Le Grand Jardin features the main Governor's House; a turreted watchtower with a roof terrace and glorious views; and a third 'guest house' building - collectively dating back as far as the 12th century. Landscaped walkways lead down to the estate's botanic gardens, fragrant with roses, geraniums and irises. Le Grand Jardin is bordered by forest on three sides (on the fourth is the sea). When it launches this summer, it will have 12 bedrooms, with the most spectacular suites in the Governor's House and The Tower; multiple relaxation and dining areas both indoor and out; a heated outdoor pool, an open-air cinema and a spa.

The trophy handbag is back - these are the best ones to buy now
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/trophy-handbag-back-best-ones-buy-now/,". As a child, I was nicknamed ‘the bag lady’ by my family, thanks to my insistence on going everywhere with several bags of all shapes and sizes draped about my person. You can always justify a bag because they’re ‘useful’, aren’t they? Well, that was until a year ago, when they were rendered utterly useless – in a practical sense, anyway. Going for a walk or to the supermarket requires a functional crossbody, at most. I know plenty of women who have kept their handbag packed and by their side as a symbol of their defiant spirit, as if nothing in the world can be in that much turmoil if your purse, tissues and lip balm (and mask and hand sanitiser) are all carefully stowed in one place.   at her feet during video calls that she would merely have had to walk down a Windsor Castle corridor to attend. But many of us feel naked without one. Now that there’s some sense of freedom on the horizon, the bag as more than a security blanket is back. Happily, we’re not quite at the point yet where you need to be worrying about double-bagging – a practice required when you’re so busy and have so much to cart about that you need two receptacles – or anything that has to stand up to the challenge of containing all you require from a 7am gym class to a 7pm dinner. Instead, this is a time to delight in lovely trophies that also happen to be useful essentials. The fact that a bag can be an instant outfit transformer had become a foggy, distant memory to me until I carried the slightly silly bow-topped bag from   for a walk with a friend recently, and it made such a difference swinging something jolly from my wrist, rather than filling my winter-coat pockets with my card and keys. Coinciding with this new appreciation, there’s a veritable Willy Wonka factory’s worth of arm candy going on this spring/summer, whether you get your highs from sleek shades of caramel or the bright rainbow palette of pick ’n’ mix. Zara’s flower-embroidered tulle tote and Staud’s beautiful beaded bag – surely   – both exude frippery and optimism. For something more considered and polished, try a sculptural raffia or canvas design, such as these options from Rejina Pyo and M&S, orJigsaw’s modern but versatile bucket bag (good if you’re feeling sensible about making a proper investment). They’d look sublime displayed on a picnic rug in the park or balanced elegantly on an outdoor restaurant table. In fact, I’m tempted to wear them all at once."

Every Easter Weekend style dilemma solved
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/easter-outfit-ideas-what-wear-bank-holiday-weekend-fashion-spring/,"The bank holiday weekend traditionally poses a host of sartorial dilemmas as the weather is always unpredictable. Now we’re in the first stages of lockdown easing, it only adds to the fashion dilemmas.  The majority of establishments are still closed until the next lifting of restrictions, so any social meetings over the long weekend must take place outdoors - that includes your family Easter lunch. So we’ll need to be warm (given the sudden drop in temperature after the warmer weather we got used to this week), chic and spring-ready…   Fear not, as we have the style solutions. Here’s how you can ensure you tick all three boxes for every Easter occasion this weekend: It’s fair to say we should be  with dressing for walks now, but to get a literal spring in your step, your look requires a new season spin.  Now that we can meet with up to five people outdoors, you won’t regret opting for fashion-forward options, so pick a coloured trench coat, a pretty knit and comfortable trainers. Take an umbrella along just in case, which means you can forgo a pack-a-mac or waterproof coat.  We can withstand cooler temperatures while we’re out and about walking, but if you’ll be sitting having a family lunch in the garden or a local park, your layers will need further thought.  You’ll need lots of light ones that you can peel off if it gets warm, rather than one chunky layer, and a pair of translucent tights will make all the difference when you’re wearing a floaty dress - for maximum consumption, naturally. If you’re escaping the city for the day, or just planning to take in some new views at the seaside, you’ll need a functional, stylish look.  Even if you’ll be wearing a small crossbody filled with the essentials, taking a larger tote along in the boot of the car is a wise idea: fill it with a swimming costume, a warm knit, a hat and an umbrella, just in case.  Given that you’ll be dashing around, a practical look that you won’t need to fuss over is a must. You’ll be on the move so you can afford to lose the outerwear, and instead, opt for a warm knit and classic jeans. A basket bag (for all of your treasures) is a handy and rather apt accessory. Churches are notoriously chilly, so if you’re attending a service on Easter Sunday, treat it as you would an outdoor lunch and layer up. That needn’t mean your look be dull, however. Nod to the Easter and spring theme with cheery brights. You’ll want to look suitably smart but comfortable, as there’ll likely be quite a bit of standing involved so avoid a heel.   Again, this is another area we all likely have down pat, but your bank holiday at home look could benefit from a spring refresh.  Opt for neutral linen and pastel lightweight cashmere, a super soft and breezy combination that’ll work for a Rosé and reading session in the garden, and lounging on the sofa taking in series one through five of   - we’re not judging. "

A budget-friendly guide to new season make-up looks
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/make-up/budget-friendly-guide-new-season-make-up-looks/,"It’s official: make-up is back. Hooray! After a year that saw sales for skincare surge as we became more interested in the lotions and potions in our bathroom cabinets than the cosmetics in our make-up bags, the time has come for us to dust off our lipsticks and collectively get our game faces on for our slow re-emergence back into society.  I, for one, can’t wait to start dressing up again. How fitting that, 100 years on from the roaring twenties, we’re seeing a return of the fun and creativity associated with make-up. Val Garland, the leading British make-up artist behind the looks on these pages, agrees: ‘After the year we’ve had, people are desperate to dress up. It’s time to get that lip on, the blush on and even more eye make-up. This period is reminiscent of the 1920s, but also the 1980s, when you wanted to be an individual.’  Interestingly, John Lewis saw a spike in the sales of make-up products following the Prime Minister’s announcement on 22 February of his roadmap to lift lockdown. Sales of foundations went up by eight per cent, mascara by 21 per cent, lipstick by 15 per cent and, perhaps most optimistically, bronzer sales skyrocketed by 66 per cent. Make-up provides much-needed escapism and a cheering beauty purchase is often both purse-friendly and mood-boosting.  Of course, as our make-up habits have shifted over the past year, so, too, has the way in which we use products – we have moved towards a more considered approach to make-up, with a focus on good multitaskers and hardworking essentials. ‘With life resuming after lockdown, we expect to see the minimal-complexion trend continue, but with bright colour pops to refresh the look,’ explains John Lewis buyer Laurie Cilberto. Val tells me that ‘even if you are quite minimalist with make-up, you can focus on really simple skin and then a pop of colour on the lips or eyes. A coloured eyeliner or bold lipstick will simply and subtly add a spark of fun.’ I couldn’t agree more. "

5 places to buy chic high street jewellery, from £15.99
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/5-places-buy-chic-high-street-jewellery-1599/,"In the last 12 months, jewellery has become a major talking point. The mid-pandemic fanfare started with character Connell Waldron’s thin gold chain on BBC series  Then Tracee Ellis Ross wore her chunky gumdrop earrings for her selfies, and  . Gradually we all turned into magpies. For those who have enjoyed dressing up for Zoom calls, a statement pair of earrings or a bold gold necklace have served to punctuate all outfits. But what if you didn't plan to spend a huge sum on your latest style update? A few unexpected high street destinations excel in creating good quality, yet affordable jewellery. Here are the five brands to consider when adding to your collection... Reiss’s jewellery collection is a small and perfectly formed one, consisting of six brushed gold pieces: two earring styles and bracelets, a necklace and belt, all with a chain link design. The no-fuss collection has an understated appeal, with prices starting at £40. Simplicity is key to the look - it's an ideal match for the clean-cut clothes that Reiss designs. Jigsaw's collection is slightly larger, at 12 pieces, yet is no less carefully considered. With prices starting at £25 for sculptural and textured huggie hoop earrings, these pieces would make a lovely gift for a friend, or for yourself if looking for an easy outfit update this spring. Each piece is plated in 24 carat gold, or Sterling silver too.  Sentimental jewellery has become a form of self-gifting, with many brands providing zodiacal, alphabetical and numerical pendants that play on the tradition of passed down family heirlooms. Maje’s gold necklace pendants are delicate and detailed, two traits to look for when trying to find pieces that look a lot more expensive than they actually are. Parisian brand Claudie Pierlot specialises in classic pieces with colourful twists. In the jewellery collection, this translates to charm bracelets, multi-material necklaces, and strung bead pieces made from turquoise and marble that will jazz up any outfit from workwear to a summer wedding guest look.   Mango offers a cave of wonders for jewellery buffs that want to mix and match. From resin pendant earrings, to layered beads and stackable rings, the message here is always that more is more.  "

How much would you pay for the perfect smile? One writer tells her very expensive story
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/wellness/much-would-pay-perfect-smile-one-writer-tells-expensive-story/,"As dentists, unlike so many others, have remained open for business, our new working-from-home lifestyles have provided the perfect excuse for a discreet smile make-over. In the past, we Brits were infamous for our wonky greige smiles, while Americans sported big, bright Hollywood teeth. Yet Covid has covertly influenced us to be more introspective, and, as we stare at ourselves multiple times a day on Zoom calls and Google Meets, more of us are choosing to upgrade our pearly whites. So much so that the UK dental industry has grown 20 per cent in lockdown and is now worth £2.2 billion. In the main, it’s money well spent, provided you choose a skilled dentist with the eye and experience to deliver super natural results. As demand grows and techniques improve, aesthetic dentistry has become increasingly subtle and individual (a British prerequisite). A carefully executed smile makeover can transform not only a client’s teeth, but their whole face. Buy the right smile and chances are that face lift can wait.  This rise in ‘smile rejuvenation’ has been spearheaded by   ( ) who tends to the smiles of the global elite in LA, New York and Dubai. Known as the ‘king of teeth’, he recently redesigned Simon Cowell’s smile, replacing his eye-popping TicTac veneers with a much more believable version. He is to dentistry what George Clooney is to film; calm, cool, and flawless in his execution. Dr Apa employs a crack team of master ceramists (porcelain veneer technicians) periodontists (gum specialists), aesthetic dentists, technicians and prosthodontic doctors (implant experts). He tells me: ""In years past a lot was done outside the dentist’s practice. If you needed surgery, you were referred to the specialist's office, and for veneers, your records were sent to a lab and made with little collaboration with the dentist, or indeed, the client."" Today, Dr Apa does all the diagnostics himself, designs the veneers freehand, and then works in collaboration with his ceramists to make the veneers. ""The smallest refinement, from the colour and contours of the porcelain to a quarter millimetre difference in length or width, can make all the difference to a smile that appears lifelike and one that looks fake. It’s like comparing couture to off-the-peg."" And with couture results, you can expect couture prices. At close to £3,000 ($4000) a tooth, a set of 20 veneers with Dr. Apa will set you back £57,000. If Dr. Apa is unavailable, though, the good news is that his natural aesthetic and minimally invasive method are informing a new trend for subtlety over here.   from Chelsea Dental Clinic has been easing me through my own smile makeover for the past 20 months. Though my teeth weren’t bad per se, they were gappy, uneven and in recent years had cracked, chipped and stained, which made them look a decade older than my skin, something I was beginning to feel self conscious about.   Dr. Eskander says, ""a couple of years ago, there was still a lot of hesitation about having cosmetic dentistry, especially veneers, but that’s all changed, especially for those over 40 who are ready to invest in themselves - they now recognise that improving their teeth is one of the most anti-ageing things they can do."" Indeed, one study by Oral B found that those with whiter, nicer teeth were perceived to be 13 years younger. Eskander explains, ""your smile is one of the first things that people notice about you from a distance - yellow, crooked teeth impact your perceived age more than wrinkles. White, proportionate teeth give an impression of youth and vitality."" Before meeting Eskander I had Invisalign (clear aligners) with Harley Street orthodontist  to correct my overbite and minimize gaps. Laing has seen a 40% increase in invisible braces since lockdown due to the Zoom effect. She says, ""as we get older our teeth tend to move so I’ve seen many more men and women in their 40's and 50s coming in for clear aligners which, thanks to digital dentistry, we can now monitor remotely with at-home equipment.""  My teeth were now technically a good position but they were small in comparison to my mouth, which is of Julia Roberts proportions - without an abundance of bright teeth to fill it. Furthermore, I was showing more gum than is strictly desirable.  Even if you don’t have a gummy smile like I do, gum symmetry is something to consider. One of the less spoken about elements in smile makeovers, it is hugely influential nonetheless. Eskander explains, ""the position of the gums and lips helps to frame your teeth. Correcting even a small amount of asymmetry can make a huge difference to a patient’s confidence - the best veneers won’t look nearly as good if the proportions of the teeth are off.""  Proportionate, well shaped gums, I’m learning, acts like groomed eyebrows - they are the anchor to your smile and help to set off your teeth in the same way that a professional picture frame does for a piece of art.  All cosmetic doctors, including dentists, loosely work to what’s known as the ‘golden ratio’ based on Medieval mathematician Fibonacci’s famous theory, otherwise known as nature’s secret code to perfect harmony. Going by his measurements, the width of each tooth should be around 70% of its length, though there is always room for interpretation depending on the individual’s quirks and facial features. My proportions were far enough off that Dr. Eskander introduced me to her in-house periodontist, Dr. Mitul Shah whom she works closely with to ensure all aspects of a patient's smile makeover are considered.  Upon meeting with Dr. Shah, we agreed on crown-lengthening surgery on ten teeth at the top, which would widen what’s known as the buccal corridor, the size of one’s smile that is defined by the space between the back teeth and the corners of the mouth when smiling. When this gap is not full of white teeth (again, Julia Roberts), it can create a shadowy area that closes the mouth in. It can be widened with braces, or in my case, by lengthening the teeth at the back of the mouth by removing excess gum. Genius, as they say, is the capacity for taking infinite pains.  Dr. Shah began the process by scanning a picture of my smile and augmenting the length of my teeth digitally to give me a visual reference of what the end result could look like. Then a stent was made to my exact proportions which he would place in my mouth during the procedure to provide a guide as to where to cut the gums. It took three hours under local anesthetic, and while it wasn’t the most pleasant experience, the healing process was quick and the pain minimal. In fact, as gory as the procedure sounds, I needed no more than two ibuprofen on the day of surgery, as the mouth has a great capacity for healing swiftly.  Now when I smile, my front teeth meet my top lip, which is considered to be more youthful. Yet, for me, it was less about age and more about confidence, since my gummy smile has bothered me since I was a child. Interestingly, no one noticed the difference but me, which is always a sign of ‘good work.’  Not all cases require surgery. In some patients, Dr Shah performs minimal gum contouring with a laser to create subtle symmetry or to even out an over-long tooth. In some specific cases Dr. Shah points out that lip repositioning will adjust where the lip lies at rest, resulting in less exposed gum.  Depending on the individual case, the dentist can do this with Botox in the nasal labial folds (nose to mouth lines), or in some cases, Dr. Shah will correct a high lip line surgically by removing a small band of tissue inside the top of the lip. He points out, ""when patients show more gum than is proportionate, some dentists would create more length at the bottom of the teeth with bonding or veneers. All that does is accentuate a gummy smile so it's important to do treat each case individually and do what's appropriate for each person in order to achieve the most aesthetically pleasing result."" Conversely, Dr. Shah can reverse receding gums that are caused by gum disease or age with a gum graft. ""In the case of gum recession, the easy option is to cover the recess with a longer veneer which can look disastrous - there is this sweet spot of gum-to-tooth proportion,"" he says.   Thanks to the crown lengthening surgery my teeth were now in correct proportion, but they still had cracks, ridges and yellowing; all part of the natural ageing process, but confidence-draining nonetheless. I had tried whitening to little effect as my teeth were too porous for peroxide, which I later discovered was due to wearing down the enamel with abrasive brushing and whitening toothpastes. I had also previously tried bonding: a whiter, Shellac-thin composite material that’s applied over the tooth, which ultimately chipped and stained. This left one option: veneers.  Veneers (porcelain shells that are bonded on top of your natural teeth) can conjure up horrifying images of blocky false-looking teeth attached to shaved-down stumps, but skilled ceramists can make contact lens-thin veneers that require far less filing down of the natural tooth - and sometimes, none at all. Dr. Eskander uses one of the few master ceramists in the UK, Simon Caxton from  , who has won awards for his lifelike veneers.  Good veneers should mimic the nuances and imperfections of real teeth, a process that takes skill and time to get right. Claxton explains, ""It’s the deviations in shade and contours that create vitality; When you craft a porcelain veneer, you start with a base layer of whiteness and then build thin layers of colour over the top. Blindingly bright, flat veneers are made of one or two layers and lack the aliveness of real teeth."" He can work subtle individual details into the design process, such as a thin gap between the front two teeth or added translucency. ""Teeth have convexities and concavities that bounce the light to create shine and texture, a bit like the facets of a diamond. A good technician understands the morphology of a natural tooth, otherwise veneers can end up looking like false nails."" Caxton explains that teeth are ever so slightly darker at the neck, brighter in the middle and have some translucency at the edges, details he builds into the veneers for a natural effect. He adds, ""It’s not a one-shape-fits-all process, it takes artistic flair and an understanding of the client’s expectations, which is why I prefer to collaborate with the dentist and the client directly."" Veneers last around 15 to 20 years, and so you must be prepared for future maintenance, but if you have tried whitening, braces, and bonding like I have and still hanker for a glossier, whiter, younger-looking smile, then bespoke veneers at a specialist cosmetic dentist such as   will elevate your whole face.   How many teeth should you do? In my case, I opted for twelve on the top row in a shade that matches the whites of my eyes (an insider tip for getting it just right). Eskander says that in some cases, four veneers at the top is all that’s required. ""In the States dentists typically do 20 teeth, 10 top and 10 bottom, but we take a softer approach. I tend not to recommend veneers on the bottom teeth because they are smaller and weaker than the top, especially in older patients. Instead, I prefer to whiten the bottom to match or do a little edge bonding to brighten and smooth any worn edges."" After taking multiple photographs, videos and X-rays, I joined a Zoom consultation with Dr. Eskander and the ceramic technician, Simon Caxton, to discuss my preference for the brightness, shape and character of my veneers. A wax up (3D model of my future teeth) is then made up, which allowed me to view the design and try it out.  Happy with the basic design of the wax up, 'temporaries' of the veneers are then made, which are fitted at a separate appointment giving me a chance to test drive my new teeth in case any tweaks are required, before the final veneers are fitted. On the penultimate appointment, Dr. Eskander filed my natural teeth before fitting the temporary veneers, following a precise technique that minimises over-filing, allowing her to take as little from my natural teeth as possible.  ""The goal is always to retain as much of the natural tooth as we can for health reasons. It's quicker and easier to shave a lot of tooth away but it's not in the patient's best interest,"" stresses Dr. Eskander. Next, the temporary teeth are bonded in place, and, while they look similar in shape to what will be the final veneers, they are made from an acrylic material that lacks the glossy finish of porcelain.  Now Caxton, Eskander and I discuss the final details. We opt for a natural looking white shade with ridges to reflect the light and boost shine with a little translucency on the bottom edges.   Having lived with my temporaries for three weeks, my veneers are made and ready to be fitted. The final appointment is the most joyous one of all, not dissimilar, I'm guessing, to trying on a couture gown following months of adjustments. When Dr. Eskander removed my temporary teeth, it took another hour and a bit of painstaking preparation to bond each veneer with laser sharp accuracy, ensuring they fit like a glove. When I finally sat up to look in the mirror I felt a sigh of relief and a wave of worry all in the same breath. What if I don't like what I see? The feeling was short lived. The result was both breathtaking and familiar, which is the beauty of going through this journey patiently, over many months, and not in one full swoop. Yes, my teeth appeared whiter and more aesthetically pleasing than before, but the comforting thing is just how real they look.  Dr. Eskander and her team did a beautiful job at listening to my needs and delivering the attention to detail that makes all the difference between a cookie cutter smile and one that is unique to me.  In the end, my smile rejuvenation journey was not about sticking to the golden ratio; after all, Kate Moss fared pretty well with a charmingly crooked smile. It was about a few can’t-quite-tell enhancements that respected the character of my face, done in the most minimally invasive ways. And you need a few pairs of super skilled hands to that pull off."

Chris Hemsworth: 'bodybuilding is seen as vanity - if I got skinny I'd be called a serious actor'
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/mens-style/chris-hemsworth-bodybuilding-seen-vanity-got-skinny-called/,"Chris Hemsworth has just got out of his chest freezer. The at-home DIY ice baths are a part of his morning routine. ""I often get up and I'm pretty stiff and sore, so to loosen up the muscles I do a sauna, then an ice bath to give me a shot of adrenaline,"" he explains of how Thor thaws. ""I've got it on a timer so that I don't freeze over. It is intense but quite meditative."" Hemsworth, 37, is gearing up for filming Thor: Love and Thunder, the 2022 installation of the Marvel franchise that has made him a cinematic demigod with 47 million Instagram followers. He has recently been named a global brand ambassador for Boss, another boost to his estimated $130 million fortune. Raised between Melbourne and the Australian Outback, Hemsworth got his break in 2004 after following elder brother Luke into soap-opera stardom, in his case on Home and Away. He made the jump to Hollywood in the late 2000s, and beat his younger brother, Hunger Games actor Liam, to the career-changing part of the Norse thunder god in 2011. After 10 years, three Thor and four Avengers films, Hemsworth says he wants to try new projects; ""things that don't feel familiar"". His rescue-mission thriller Extraction was 2020's most watched movie on Netflix, and he was recently announced to play Terry Bollea, aka Hulk Hogan, in an upcoming biopic. Hemsworth appears well dressed and well mannered at all times, and his laugh is an on-brand roar that regularly punctuates blunt truths, particularly around his body image. He has managed to strike a balance between his celebrity and his personal life by moving back to Byron Bay in 2015 with his wife, model Elsa Pataky. Their three children, daughter India Rose, eight, and twin sons Sasha and Tristan, seven, have all inherited his tousled blond hair as well as his passion for running wild and spending as much time as possible in the ocean. Here, he lets us into his universe. I haven't been this still for 15 years. The pandemic meant going from being on a plane every second week, to being 24/7 at home combining work and family life. But I've really enjoyed being grounded. Not saying goodbye to the kids regularly has been fantastic. This is probably the fittest and strongest I've been before all the Thors. Having this time at home meant I explored different methods, to see how I can manipulate my body with just the right amount of powerlifting and bodybuilding workouts. For years I probably over trained. People who do muscle-building often don't realise it's a sport that shouldn't be seven days a week, two hours a day. I was doing that in the previous Thors, and was coming up sorer, with less energy. That's what you see the most. Working with my trainer, we consider the costume and if it shows a lot of shoulder, or are we gonna see the bicep or the traps. But you want it to be balanced, because there's probably a shirt-off scene somewhere. You don't want to look like Popeye with one section of the body blown up. There's an aesthetic that the role requires. Bodybuilding is seen as vanity, whereas if I put on a bunch of unhealthy weight, or got unhealthily skinny for a role, I'd probably be called a serious actor. The training across 10 years of doing it is a full-time job. That and then a 12-hour shooting day - it's real grind. It's incredibly rewarding, too - you have to look at it like a professional athlete. As a young kid, if I wasn't in the best of head spaces, the ocean was a place to reset. We lived about an hour from the beach, and my mum would drive us there at 4am to get 40 minutes in the surf before school. As my brothers and I got older, we had a carpool of young grommets and their surfboards. You had a couple of dollars in your pocket for a meat pie. Some of my happiest memories are of having no money. You've got your sleeping bag, you're in the back of someone's car, it's hot and uncomfortable, but all you care about is surfing. My style has changed due to better influences around me, whether that's my wife or a stylist. Looking back at my Home and Away days, so 17 years ago, there were a lot of boot-leg jeans. I remember actively seeking out flares not skinnies. It makes me laugh to think how convinced I was. When the opportunity to work with the fashion section of Boss came along, it was a very easy decision. There are no egos, and that makes for a great working relationship when you're collaborating together. I use Boss Bottled fragrance, then whatever moisturiser my wife has on the shelf. I need to remember to do it, because I'm starting to see all the sun damage from surfing. And I do the sauna, then the freezer bath for a huge peak of endorphins. Location. If it's around where I live, I'm a lot more interested now from the family practicality stance. [Thor: Love and Thunder will be filmed in Australia, as will Extraction 2]. From an artistic point of view, anytime I feel like I've visited that space before, I either need to find a unique angle on it or find something else. When I first started my career I had so much anxiety [about auditioning for new roles]. Some of that was detrimental, but it forced me to work harder. I made sure I was always prepped, and I'd done my research. I always rehearse and have a strong opinion on the script. When you get too comfortable you don't dig as deep. I like that reminder: you could slip and fall here, get it together. I think it's a great motivation, feeling that uncertainty, having that little bit of fear knocking at the door."

Jenny Packham on working with her husband and how Covid will transform fashion 
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/jenny-packham-working-husband-covid-will-transform-fashion/,"I wake up at around 5.30am (very early, but that’s my body clock), make breakfast for my sprocker spaniel, Byron, then roll out my yoga mat. Stretching eases me into the day. My dad texts me every day to prove he’s alive: a family joke, but it’s comforting to hear from him. I make an effort getting dressed, even during lockdown. I lean towards black and navy, and experiment with textures. Mathew and I live near the office, so we walk there through Hampstead Heath. Lockdown simplified our routine as store visits and meetings were cancelled, allowing us to redesign the collections to reflect the world’s new circumstances. I also finished my book, How to Make a Dress, about my journey and why clothes are important. The pandemic will change the fashion industry permanently – I believe there will be an explosion of creativity when we come out the other side. Mathew and I often discuss business in the evenings: we’re used to it after working together for 33 years. It’s good that we’re able to tackle challenges jointly. He usually cooks dinner (I love his vegetable curry) and then we go for a walk with Byron. Afterwards, I watch Netflix in the bath on my laptop and read in bed until I drift off. We’ve also started cycling at weekends. There’s nowhere I’d rather be than London – I’ve fallen in love with it all over again after exploring by bike. My William Welstead ring. Although a little ostentatious for me, I love his edgy, raw-cut designs. Many would be surprised how few Jenny Packham pieces I own, but I do enjoy wearing my designs when I have a special occasion to go to. The Queen’s Gambit on Netflix. It is such a treat to watch. Everything from the styling to the set is perfection. Holding my new book for the first time: it took two years to write so I’m thrilled it’s finally out. Kimono: Kyoto to Catwalk at the Victoria & Albert Museum - I’m suffering from not being able to visit galleries throughout lockdown – I’m glad I managed to see this exhibition. We created a dress for Kate Winslet for the Titanic 3D premiere in 2012 – it was made in four days. Fashion editor @deborahbrett - she’s so glamorous and I admire her tongue-in-cheek style of posting. Dita Von Teese - I have made a few of Dita’s costumes.

Appearing too polished is the quickest way to date a look, so by offsetting her outfits with a casual element or two she adds a modern touch that makes her style seem as classic as it does on-trend. Her signature trick? Balancing the masculine with the feminine, which always looks fresh and comfortable. Think a mannish coat over a metallic satin gown for evening, where an equally dressy jacket might look fussy, or a messy updo, white trainers and a suede bag – rather than wedges and a perfect ponytail – with a floaty summer dress.  Holmes is never try-hard, so set aside anything overly racy. Her cardi twinset slipping off the shoulder just so and paired with straight leg jeans and chunky mules felt subtly sexy.  With “relaxed” at one end of the fashion scale and “glamorous” at the other, the Holmes style strategy is toeing the middle line. Note that a blazer is a great cover-up for any look, and a neutral colour palette will make even the most casual of ensembles appear slick.   Amid the Elizabeth Hurleys and J-Los of this world,   to if you a) need to leave the house in your outfits and b) don’t exist on a diet of green juice. Obama has spent the past few years zoning in on a style which works for her post-First Lady life, but is still glamorous and fun. Her long-time stylist, Meredith Koop, calls their approach “modern comfort”. What’s really clever about Obama’s style is that she always feels relevant, while always prioritising what she knows looks great on her; tailored jackets, wide-legged, high-waisted trousers and jumpsuits are all key pieces. If it sounds boring to stick to such a small rotation of silhouettes, it’s really not – see her love for offbeat, uplifting colours (lime, wine and turquoise) and exuberant accessories.  Wearing something that doesn’t suit you because you feel you should keep up with trends or anything uncomfortable.  Obama has a tailor on speed dial. It’s an investment and a faff having pieces tweaked to fit perfectly, but it will pay off in the end. And don’t be afraid to “own” styles that work for you and make you feel confident. A tea dress or boiler suit may be to you what palazzo pants are to Michelle.   You don’t get the impression that Sharon asks herself if she’s too old to wear something before putting it on. It’s an approach that serves her well, as nothing is off-limits – although she always strikes a careful balance between sexy and sophisticated. A mannish suit is teamed with a plunging camisole, or leather leggings with an oversized knit. She doesn’t mind making a bold statement, either: while many women in their sixties feel obliged to dress in modest, muted, timeless clothing, Stone embraces trends. Anything uncomfortable –  . That means nothing too small, too itchy, and no blister-inducing shoes. Nothing ruins a look like a lack of confidence in your outfit. A great suit is the cornerstone of this look. Go for something slightly oversized with a strong shoulder to really nail the Sharon Stone aesthetic.  Balance it out with feminine details like a cropped leg or a lace-trimmed vest top, and team with shoes you can actually walk in – Sharon wears heels on the red carpet, but off-duty she loves a lace-up brogue.  Maye Musk, model, dietitian, mother of Elon, is the posterwoman for anyone who thinks they’re too old to participate in fashion. With her swoop of white hair, boldly coloured lips, poise and love of bold simplicity, she’s usually the one quietly stealing the show, whatever the event. There’s methodology to her Maye-ness and every element is counterbalanced – any starkness is offset by the glorious softness of that halo of silver hair.  Grunge. Boho. Kitsch. Missed appointments at the hairdressers.  . A natural sophisticate, she avoids the twee. A great trouser suit (Paul Smith is an excellent starting point or The Fold’s check trouser suit) is a good place to start. Alternatively, well-chosen separates that enable you to accentuate your favourite features. Add in some playful, unfussy details – beautiful jewellery or a fabulous scarf.  Dench’s choices have always been about comfort over cool, because when you have a signature hairstyle like her pixie cut, which dates back to the late Fifties, you don’t need to pay trends too much attention. She’s rarely to be seen without a light duster coat that accompanies her coordinating wide-leg trousers and tunic tops. In choosing to wear soft fabrics such as linens, velvets and embroidered pieces in neutral tones, she compliments her fair complexion and white hair. Sometimes adding a “pop of colour” isn’t the fashion solution it’s made out to be. If going bright is out of your comfort zone, trust your instincts. You can still wear colour, though – a mint green can be treated as a neutral and works for everyday wear.  Build a foundation of basics in your favourite five shades, which can be easily done at places like Uniqlo and  . The duster coat is what ties Dench’s look together – this is where you can invest your money on bespoke pieces, preloved items on eBay and Etsy or simply head to Toast or Hayley Menzies. "

Line of Duty's style secrets, from Vicky McClure's 'iconic' coats to Kelly Macdonald's sharp suits
",style,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/line-dutys-style-secrets-vicki-mcclures-iconic-coats-kelly-macdonalds/,"I’m not saying that season six of  has suddenly mutated into a fashion parade of   proportions. Heaven forbid. But what with all the career advancements – Kate Fleming now a DI, DS Steve Arnott about to be promoted – the outfits have had a serious upgrade. Not even the lanyards they all have to wear seemingly 24/7 can destroy them. Arnott’s signature three-piece suit normally comes from Ted Baker. But this time it has been custom-made for him by Suitors of Belfast (where LoD is filmed). If that doesn’t perfectly convey Arnot’s ever-increasing cockiness, what does? Make that suits, plural. The only subject garnering lengthier forensic discussions than the script’s ever-proliferating acronyms is Arnot’s lockdown weight gain and his fluctuating girth. Maggie Donnelly, in charge of costumes on LoD since the second season, acted as my CHIS (Covert Human Intelligence Source) on this investigation. She tactfully reveals that Martin Compston (Arnott) worked out religiously last year. It’s not fat we’re viewing, apparently, but “upper-body muscle which changed his shape quite a bit”. The truth is that beyond the waistcoats, the natty linings which Arnott loves to a questionable degree and his shirts, about which he is apparently very particular, I couldn’t care less about the men’s togs. It’s all about the female detectives and how they navigate jobs that combine occasional spurts of physical exertion with desk-work and lots of face-to-face with suspects. An outfit that can adapt to all that would work for many jobs and that’s why this season’s LoD in particular has some  . DI Kate Fleming, for instance, has learnt the importance of investing in what Donnelly calls “an iconic coat” each season. This season it’s a navy trench from A.P.C. She’s also adept at making two new trouser suits a year go a long way by ringing the changes underneath with M&S coloured polo necks, stripy J Crew knits and Tommy Hilfiger shirts. This season’s trouser suits are a black one from ME + EM and a navy one from The Fold. “But Vicky [McClure, who plays Fleming] is very happy to wear pieces from past seasons,” says Donnelly, because she’s a classic dresser who sticks mainly to a palette of blues, black, grey and white, her wardrobe works in unison (clearly a keen student of the Telegraph’s fashion pages). “A black drapey Jigsaw jacket from season 5 is a favourite,” says Donnelly, but Kate also   and her beloved Fossil bag. After poor Keeley Hawes was made to wear the saddest-sack suits known to humanity in season two (for many the best season to date, terrible tailoring notwithstanding), the women in   have generally had a better time, sartorially at least. In season four, Thandie Newton got to wear Joseph,   and Theory – or she did before The Unfortunate Incident With The Arm. That too-nice-to-be-regulation-police-uniform jacket DI Jo Davidson (Kelly Macdonald) wears in the first episode of season six, is from Belstaff, while the 1970s-inspired, sharp blue checked trouser suit that had me scrolling on Lyst while everyone else was googling what MIT stands for, is from Maje.  , KJ’s Laundry and Agnès B (you didn’t think the brands would come without their own acronyms did you?). These women wear their suits well and clearly derive a sense of confidence from dressing not just appropriately but with a degree of style, even when they’re having to conceal a gun, “which is hard to hide in a trouser suit”, says Donnelly. It’s impressive how much care has been taken to get the clothes right, both in terms of being an accurate reflection of what high-ranking, detectives might wear (including taking into account the stab vests and holsters they have to conceal underneath those blazers), but also helping along the drama. “For Keeley Hawes’s character, in season two, it was important to reflect how far she had sunk in her grief,” says Donnelly. “It’s a credit to Keeley how much she embraced it all as the scripts kept coming – neck brace, forensics scrubs, prison clothes. She was allowed some power suits in her court scenes – a nod possibly to where she would have been in her career if fate hadn’t dealt her that hand.” Steve Arnott’s famous waistcoats provide yet more exposition. The only clothing that would afford viewers a clearer view of one of his back spasms would be a stringed vest, which wouldn’t be in character. Meanwhile, Kate Fleming has actively elevated her look to go with her promotion (including a   and bomber from A.P.C.). As for Jo Davidson, some of her colour choices, particularly the mustard top, are those of a reckless risk-taker. Also, that Belstaff jacket would have set her back a good £450 plus. Prima facie evidence, surely, that’s she’s on the take. At the very least, she exhibits the hallmarks of an obsessive late-night online shopper. Affirmative, says Donnelly. “For Jo, clothes are armour.” Tempting as it is to inject extra glamour, as an American cop show would do, Donnelly tries to resist. “It’s important to convey a realistic look. We take artistic licence sometimes. Martin gets concerned about his shirt collars riding up in long interview scenes, so we sew on little press studs. Adrian Dunbar [aka Hastings, aka the gaffer] is the most opinionated of all because he so rarely gets out of uniform that when he does, he enjoys a “long fitting”. To anyone concerned that DI Davidson’s slashed leather biker jacket represents another profligate chunk out of the licence fee, rest assured: it was an old jacket from props. And to all those scratching their heads over the impenetrably dense plot, follow the clues in the clothes."

Questor: want to double your money in the stock market in a week? This is how to do it
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/shares/questor-want-double-money-stock-market-week-do/,"This column normally believes in long-term investing – let’s say over five years or more – so it’s a drastic change of course to seek to double our money in a week. Rest assured that we will go back to “get rich slow” next week, but today we aim to help readers win one of the new weekly prizes in our  , the latest round of which begins next Tuesday. In this third contest in the series we have increased the weekly prizes very significantly from £100 to £1,000 so there is now a strong incentive for readers to try their hand at this alternative, quick-fire approach to making money on shares. Questor must stress that we would only ever discuss such short-term speculation (it cannot be called investing) in the context of a competition such as this and not when your own real money is on the line. Perhaps the real benefit of this exercise will be as a demonstration, if any were needed, of the near impossibility of making large gains in short periods with any kind of reliability on the stock market. In the long term, a rational analysis of a company’s strengths will tend to win, but over short periods the benefits of such evidence-based approaches are swamped by the effects of sentiment. Investors, even professional ones, are human beings and their actions are affected by what is going on around them and by what others do, even if in the cold light of day nothing has changed at the company in question. So with all those caveats on the table let’s try to answer that question: if we want to double our money in a week in the stock market, what should we do? Step one: avoid the FTSE 100. On the whole the bigger you are the more stable you are and the less scope there is for a single event to move your share price materially. In fact, ideally we need to be exploring the lower reaches of the market: the FTSE Small Cap, Fledgling or Aim indices. Among some of the tiny companies here there really would be a chance of finding stocks that could double in a week. Unfortunately those options are not open to contestants because Fantasy Fund Manager is restricted to the FTSE 350, which is the combination of the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250, the next 250 largest companies by market value after the blue-chip index. So for the purposes of the competition we should seek our big winners at the smaller end of the FTSE 250. Now let’s think about which sectors are most likely to be home to companies with the potential for game-changing announcements that could send their shares soaring. The ones that spring to mind are miners, oil explorers and drugs companies. Here a lot can hinge on the success or otherwise of a single project: a mine, an oil well or a treatment for a disease. A big discovery of easily recovered gold or oil, or the success of the trials of a new drug, can transform a company’s prospects and its share price. Among smaller stocks it is not uncommon to see a share price double as soon as a positive announcement is published. The opposite frequently happens too of course, which makes such stocks dangerous when you invest real money. In our contest, however, you have the chance to win a decent sum if good news is heard and no risk of losing anything if the tidings are bad. Here are a few of the names in these sectors to be found at the smaller end of the FTSE 250. Diversified Gas & Oil and Energean are two oil explorers, Petropavlovsk, Hochschild Mining and Centamin are miners and PureTech Health, Oxford Biomedica and Indivior are healthcare companies. A look at their share price graphs shows that all have been volatile over the past year or so and volatility in this instance is of course precisely what we seek, protected as we are from real financial consequences from share price falls but in a position to benefit from rises. 
 
Questor suggests that readers follow some of these stocks. One approach would be to buy the shares of any that are closer to the bottom than the top of their recent trading ranges in the hope that any renewed volatility goes in our favour. Good luck – and remember to invest any winnings in stocks tipped (for real) here!"

Green Homes grant axed after six months following poor take-up
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/28/green-homes-grant-axed-six-months-following-poor-take-up/,"Rishi Sunak’s £2bn   is to shut after just six months following low take-up by the public. The insulation subsidy programme   is closing on Wednesday amid a failure to win widespread support. It was previously touted as a key part of government efforts to “build back greener” and meet the country’s climate goals, but was dogged by delays as would-be applicants struggled to get quotes for work from busy builders. Last week, a report by MPs accused ministers of underestimating the cost of improving the efficiency of many homes and asked for the scheme to be extended to accommodate the delays. The environmental audit select committee said the scheme was essential for improving Britain’s energy efficiency plans, but warned that delays in grant payments “had devastating consequences on many of the builders and installers that can do the work, who have been left in limbo as a result of the orders cancelled”. Before the decision to close the scheme was made, it was due to run until March 2022. The programme allowed English homeowners to apply for vouchers worth up to £10,000 to make their properties more efficient, cutting emissions and promising a saving on bills of up to £600 a year. The money could cover up to two thirds of the cost of improvements such as loft or cavity wall insulation and draught proofing. Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, said an extra £300m will be made available for investing in energy-saving measures for homes instead, distributed by local authorities. A spokesman for the Business Department said: “Applications made before the end of March deadline will be honoured and any vouchers already issued may be extended upon request.”"

Questor: in the last chance saloon, India Capital Growth’s managers have delivered
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/funds/questor-last-chance-saloon-india-capital-growths-managers-have/,"Few investment trusts can boast a tripling in their share price in the space of just a year. While   is able to make this rare claim, it has been a rollercoaster ride for investors none the less. Even before Covid-19 sent global stock markets into a tailspin last spring, the trust’s performance had disappointed. The market in which it invests, small and medium-sized Indian stocks, had performed badly, the trust’s own holdings had underperformed this market and the discount had widened substantially. Things then went from bad to worse as the pandemic took hold. While Indian small and medium-sized shares fell by 30pc in March last year,  . This caused its discount to balloon to 42pc in April. With things looking dire, the board gave the trust’s manager, Ocean Dial, 18 months to turn performance around and offered investors the option to redeem some or all of their shares at a maximum discount of 6pc by the end of 2021 and every two years thereafter. As the trust was trading on a 34pc discount at the time, this provided an attractive exit route – and it was for this reason that Questor, which had initially tipped the trust in March 2017, advised readers not to sell. The good news is that, 10 months on, the outlook for India Capital Growth is looking brighter. Performance has turned around: the underlying portfolio has returned 93pc over the past year, according to Numis, the broker. What’s more, the discount has narrowed to 12pc. This can be attributed to a repositioning of the portfolio and a rebound by the Indian stock market since the country came out of lockdown last June. Since then, the economy has continued to show signs of recovery and has remained open. Even in light of the trust’s improved performance, Daniel Lockyer, a fund manager at Hawksmoor Investment Management, said he believed it had further to go. “From here I expect to see some great opportunities because the economic conditions are positive,” he said. “The population has largely escaped the worst of Covid: although India still has a lot of cases, the deaths and restrictions are less than in many other countries. The government has put in a very stimulative budget and corporate earnings are also positive and growing nicely.” Mr Lockyer also highlighted the potential gain on offer if investors chose to participate in the share redemption at the end of the year. “Ideally we want the share price to go up to the net asset value, but even if it goes the other way you still have a 6pc margin of error from where we are today,” he said. This could present adventurous investors with an opportunity to make money in nine months’ time. However, given how much India Capital Growth’s discount has narrowed over the past 10 months, it would be remiss of Questor to describe it as a screaming buy. We'll stick with a hold rating. Investors in   received 12.5pc of their investment back at near par value in early February – not a bad outcome given that the trust was trading at an 11pc discount at the time. The redemption was under the trust’s policy to repurchase shares when assets exceed £100m to retain a focus on Britain’s smallest listed companies. This policy can be seen as both a blessing and a curse. If the trust is trading at a premium you will be forced to sell your shares at a lower price and there are potential tax implications too. However, while the trust trades at a discount there are opportunities to benefit from an uplift: and it would appear that another return of capital could be on the cards in light of the fund’s strong recent performance. Over the past six months alone the underlying portfolio has gained 39pc. A spokesman for N+1 Singer, the trust’s broker, said the board had historically returned capital when assets were in the £115m to £120m range. With gross assets close to £115m, he said another redemption looked likely if good performance continued. As the trust trades at a 7.5pc discount, this presents an attractive support for the valuation. "

Custom House hotel makeover to reignite deal controversy
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/28/custom-house-hotel-makeover-reignite-deal-controversy/,"One of the Government’s most famous buildings is to be turned into a plush London hotel in a £180m project – without a penny of any profit going to the taxpayer. Custom House – a Grade I listed Georgian building that dominates the north bank of the Thames in central London – is set to be converted by Guernsey-based  , which bought the freeholds and historic leaseholds of 132 HMRC offices for £370m in 2001 in a 20-year private finance initiative deal. The development is likely to reignite controversy over the original deal, signed when Tony Blair was prime minister. There was fury when it emerged the property portfolio had been transferred to Bermuda. A sale and leaseback agreement under which Mapeley provided serviced government offices means HMRC has since paid the firm more than £3.5bn. Mapeley is also facing questions about the details of its proposal for Custom House, for which the firm agreed a 175-year lease at a peppercorn rent. The application, which is due to come before a City of London Corporation committee later this year, sets out plans to convert the neo-classical building into a 204-bedroom hotel with two rooftop pavilions. The historic 180ft Long Room where officials once processed paperwork for customs duties will be refurbished. Conservation charity the Georgian Group opposes the plans and said they would harm the significance of the building. Mapeley subsidiary Cannon Capital Developments has devised other ambitious property developments in former government offices across the country, including in Edinburgh, Manchester, Leicester, Milton Keynes and Swansea. Mapeley’s other historic gems include The Mount, a Grade II listed property in Shrewsbury which is the birthplace of Charles Darwin, and Custom House in Belfast which was sold to an investment firm last year."

The proposal threatening to condemn London's homes to darkness
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/28/proposal-threatening-condemn-londons-homes-darkness/,"After a year of rolling lockdowns and shuttered offices, light and airy housing has never been more important to Britain’s legions of city dwellers. Alongside the old staples of a lively local high street, good pub and short commute, a new box has been added to typical home-hunter’s checklist – how much sun their property lets in. But the demand for natural light is threatening to put occupiers at odds with developers at a time when space is at a premium and   is seen as essential to solve the country’s housing crisis. In London, a consultation launched by mayor Sadiq Khan includes a possible reduction in a key measure of how much light builders must allow into their properties, the so-called vertical sky component. “There’s a bit of a battle going on,” says lighting consultant Paul Littlefair. “Obviously, you have developers who want to build bigger and bigger and have buildings that restrict more light. And obviously from a point of view of providing housing in London, you need all this extra housing. “But on the other hand, [you have] existing residents who need daylight and want to retain the daylight they currently have.” The vertical sky component calculates the angle of light entering through a window and is meant to prevent dingy houses from getting built. It is part of planning code and must be taken into account by developers along with other environmental measures. Campaigners argue the changes proposed in the consultation could condemn thousands of families to perpetual semi-darkness. They say that the changes will significantly cut how much light enters individual rooms and point out that being cut off from the sun can harm occupiers’ physical and mental health. “The links between daylight and both physical and mental health are very well established,” says planning activist George Turner. “After a year of being locked down in our homes, I think we can all appreciate the importance of having access to adequate daylight. “Daylight standards do not stop new development, they stop bad development. There is no reason why competent architects can’t design new buildings that protect the living conditions of neighbours.” The row over daylight is already causing a headache for ministers. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick is poised to rule on a £500m project at 8 Albert Embankment, a London Fire Brigade site being developed into 443 homes which builder U+I says will create 1,200 new jobs. Researchers at the Building Research Establishment (BRE) have warned that 424 properties would fall below its recommended daylight standards as new buildings cut off the views from existing ones, including accommodation for disabled people in the ground floor of a nearby block of flats, and Turner is leading a bid to protect neighbours’ rights. A spokesman for U+I defended the development, saying the benefits outweighed the costs. He said: “As with all tall buildings in central London there will always be some impact, particularly in areas like this where local and regional planning policy supports high density development. “With a slender diamond shaped form, the taller elements of our proposals have been specifically designed to minimise any impact on neighbouring properties, and as a result the level of daylight retained would be considered normal in other central London areas. “This ultimately needs to be balanced against the huge number of public benefits that this scheme will deliver, including a modern new fire station [and] a permanent home for the London Fire Brigade Museum. More than 40pc of the properties being built will be affordable, the spokesman said. Despite the battle coming to a head over Albert Embankment, the debate is not a new one. The BRE has previously raised concerns about a host of other major projects including Wood Wharf on the Isle of Dogs, part of a rejuvenation of an area previously owned by British Waterways. Planning was approved in 2014 by Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London, despite BRE objections during the initial planning stage which found that 993 of 2,153 surrounding windows would fall below BRE thresholds for light levels if it went ahead. Other planned projects in the area had similar issues. Canary Wharf’s Heron Quay West caused 730 individual breaches of the BRE tests, while the proposed Columbus tower left 60pc of surrounding homes to fall below the minimum level for new buildings. Experts such as Littlefair admit there is increasingly a trade-off between protecting existing homes’ access to daylight and solving London’s housing crisis. As businesses across the capital embrace flexible working, that challenge is only going to grow."
,business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/02/sadiq-khan-cannot-keep-demanding-billions-bail-tube/,"Sadiq Khan has rolled out every excuse in the book on why London’s public transport crisis is not his fault. From being stripped of an annual Westminster grant of £700m to Boris Johnson saddling Transport for London with billions in debts during his time as mayor, Khan has insisted he is not to blame. Despite all these headwinds, London’s heroic mayor insists he had put TfL on track to being back in the black. Then Covid struck. Even Khan’s fiercest critics cannot blame him for the coronavirus pandemic. With the nation locked down for much of the last year, passenger numbers fell by as much as 90pc - and with this, most of the £5bn in fares TfL collects each year. But his opponents will underline that the Labour mayor’s boneheaded pledge to freeze fares has not helped matters. That cost £640m over the four years. Londoners should be thanking their lucky stars. Had Khan delivered Crossrail on time (it is running a mere four years late and £5bn over budget) his fare freeze could have cost the authority £1.9bn in lost fare revenue. Johnson has stumped up more than £3bn of taxpayer cash to keep TfL afloat since the pandemic hit. Now Khan wants £15.8bn for a deal that lasts until the end of the decade. In the eyes of the Tories, the problem with him is simple: give him an inch and he will take a mile. The mayor has offered “concessions” in return. These, he says, will raise an estimated £500m a year, limiting the amount of money taxpayers will need to stump up to get him out of his hole. One option is to sting those living outside the capital - many in Conservative constituencies - £5.50 to drive into greater London. It's a tax that is focused on the Tory voter; the suburban families who drive to work or drop off their kids at school. Another is for Khan to snaffle London’s share of vehicle excise duty, the levy that, much to the chagrin of cyclists, car drivers mistakenly refer to as “road tax”. Both have quite rightly been dismissed by Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary. The former is a blatant political move (one trade union leader even admitted as much to me earlier this week); the latter could open the floodgates for metro mayors across the country embarking on a similar tax grab. Khan is way ahead in the polls. It will be a miracle if anyone gets close to him when London goes to the ballot box next month. Surely this gives him licence for some bold - and potentially unpopular among his supporters - thinking. One example of this is raised by his own advisers. Unfortunately it seems to have been ignored. An independent review of TfL published in December highlights that the London council tax contribution to transport per household is £22. The average across metropolitan areas in England is £104. In Merseyside, the contribution is £146. This is worth repeating: Scousers’ bill for their public transport is seven times that of Cockneys. Khan’s experts conclude that imposing a flat council tax supplement of £130 on Londoners will generate the £500m he needs. A big jump, but one that brings the capital in line with much of the rest of the country. Alternatively, he could even rejig the supplement, known as a precept, so that it is linked to property prices, meaning the bill is shouldered by the wealthy. The problem with these options is that they are unlikely to win votes. Indeed, they could even end up putting off some of London’s champagne socialists. Khan’s tenure as London mayor is littered with examples of policies to keep his supporters happy - something that has only served to stiffen the resolve of his critics. The Met Police are independent. On property, Khan can be overruled by the ever-bungling housing minister Robert Jenrick. Whether he likes it or not, transport is one the mayor's last main vestiges of power. There are plenty of good reasons why the London public transport crisis is not Khan's fault. However, that does not absolve him of responsibility and neither does not give him carte blanche to go cap in hand to Johnson over and over again. Whether he likes it or not, this is Khan’s mess. It is time he sorted it out himself."

Carbon kitemarks to help shoppers make green choice
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/17/carbon-kitemarks-help-shoppers-make-green-choice/,"The Government is to introduce a low-carbon kitemark to enable consumers to choose greener products, as it aims to cut industrial emissions by two-thirds in 15 years, the business secretary will announce today.  A new Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy will also commit more than £1 billion to help install solar panels, LED lights and insulation to help schools, hospitals and councils to go green. It will also look at carbon pricing to ensure industry takes pollution into their business decisions, and invest £171 million for low carbon technology including carbon capture usage and storage projects in nine industrial areas across the north, Scotland and south Wales. The strategy forms part of the Government’s response to industry-led calls for more support to decarbonise in the face of competition from  and as part of its  Heavy industry is one of the most polluting sectors in the UK, with industries such as steel a particular challenge to decarbonise. The Government said it would look at targets for ore-based steelmaking to reach near-zero emissions by 2035. It also said it would also look at mechanisms to mitigate against “carbon leakage”, which can occur as either polluting industries move abroad or domestic industry is outpriced by  “We were the first major economy to put into law our target to end our contribution to climate change, and today we’re taking steps to be the first major economy to have its own low-carbon industrial sector,” said Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business and Energy Secretary. “While reaching our climate targets will require extensive change across our economy, we must do so in a way that protects jobs, creates new industries and attracts inward investment – without pushing emissions and business abroad.” Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK, the manufacturers’ organisation, said: “The promise of financial help is critical. “Britain’s big corporations have large, ring-fenced budgets for green initiatives, but our smaller firms will need support to make sure they are able to make the changes necessary to ensure the UK meets its carbon targets and that they can benefit from the dramatic changes to the way industry will work in the coming years.” Green groups welcomed the Government’s commitment to emissions reductions within the next 15 years, but called for more ambition. Roz Bulleid, deputy policy director at Green Alliance, said: “The commitment to look at near zero ore-based steelmaking by 2035 is welcome, but the country needs to move quickly if our steel industry is not to be left behind.”"

Having to constantly chase up the broker only to find your wife’s account was suspended put a lot of strain on you both. It was the last thing your wife needed as she is currently recovering from cancer surgery. And then to be told your complaint could take eight weeks to resolve: well, that nearly pushed you over the edge. I asked Interactive Investor on March 4 to investigate why your wife was locked out. By March 8 – getting on for a month after she first attempted to sell the fund – it finally gave her access to her investments. As soon as she was alerted your wife sold the fund, but for significantly less than if she had made the transaction when she first wanted to. She described this as a “scandal”. When I spoke to Interactive Investor, it did not take long for it to agree that things had gone wrong. Gary Shaw from the firm said: “We have to hold our hands up here. We failed to provide the customer with the right support. This is our mistake, and it is one that we intend to put right.” He explained that a security concern had been raised on the account which it failed to resolve swiftly enough. He added: “Security of our customers’ assets is of the utmost importance to us and we have strong checks and balances in place to prevent fraud.” Interactive Investor apologised for the inconvenience and has now credited your wife’s account with £13,237.57 – the extra sum she would have got if she had managed to sell the fund when she made her first call. Your wife described this as “truly amazing news”."

The Secret Science of Sewage may turn you green… in a good way
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2021/03/18/secret-science-sewage-may-turn-green-good-way/,"We’re at the sewage works and presenter Zoe Laughlin has just declared that it’s “time for a poo”. She’s opening a tub, surely it’s not going to contain… oh, thank goodness, it’s a poo substitute. Made from soya bean paste, which apparently is “industry standard for simulating turds in the toilet”. Well, you learn something new every day. If you’re about to stop reading in disgust then I don’t imagine you sat through   (BBC Two). I can’t blame you and neither can the show’s main host, Dr George McGavin, because as he explained: the sight and smell of human waste is “something we’re hard-wired to avoid”. We’re also programmed, as adults, to consider all this poo talk to be the preserve of five-year-old boys. And yet, if you had watched it, you might have found this Horizon film to be pretty interesting. It showed us how a sewage works operates – this one on the outskirts of Birmingham – but also explored ways in which all this waste could be harnessed for treating disease and charging your mobile phone. If surveys on social media are to be believed, an inordinate amount of children were taken on school trips to the local sewage works. Let’s hope all the visits were enlivened by the presence of an employee like the one who appeared here to describe the particular delights of his job, including administering a machine that sieves out large bits of matter from the river of raw sewage: “When you open it up and see a dead rat hanging by its tail, it’s still a bit of a shocker.” Ok, enough of the grim stuff. The mobile phone powered by pee was a fascinating idea, using the live bacteria in urine to generate electricity. The professor responsible for the project believes it could be scaled up and included in the fabric of houses. McGavin described it as “a ubiquitous and never-ending” fuel source. Other uses for the stuff found in  our sewage was mooted: powering cars, killing off deadly superbugs.  A woman turned up whose job was described as “sludge scientist”.  When did this programme get too much for me? It may have been when they discussed the “spicy top-notes” you could smell at the plant, or when they yelped with delight at the sight of micro-organisms – blown up on a screen to look like monsters – eating tiny particles of… well, you can guess. But fair play to the BBC for serving up an unpalatable subject as part of its science output."

Fortnite maker Epic kicks off UK lawsuit against Google

Rev Richard Coles: ‘I went from living hand-to-mouth to flying Concorde’
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/fame-fortune/rev-richard-coles-went-living-hand-to-mouth-flying-concorde/,"Possibly the most famous vicar in Britain, the Rev Richard Coles is a classically trained musician who in the 1980s joined the pop group Bronski Beat and later the Communards, achieving three Top Ten hits, including the dance version of Don’t Leave Me This Way, in 1986. He is also an author and broadcaster and regularly hosts Radio 4’s Saturday Live. His civil partner, the Rev David Coles, died in December 2019. Mr Coles lives in Finedon, Northamptonshire. I was born into relatively privileged circumstances, the son of a shoe manufacturer in Northamptonshire, a family company that had been going for four generations; it funded a public school education for me though I was quite a Bolshevik schoolboy. I became a die-hard leftie and over the years, as I became a Christian, that morphed into a suspicion of the value of worldly goods. Having said that, there is a hard-nosed Midlands manufacturer in me that is another part of my inheritance. My closest friend pointed out that for all my rejection of materialism, I have never been in debt, I have always earned a living and I have always managed to provide for my future. So although it has perhaps been covert, I think there is something in me that is mindful of money. I ran away to London in the early 1980s when I was 18 and signed on the dole, the way people did then. I was dirt poor and lived in a squalid flat for four years. So I know what it is like to be skint. Then I went from zero to pop star. It was poor training for dealing with finance. I had literally been living on beans when I signed a recording contract. The advance was £60,000, a sizeable sum in 1984. I bought a grand piano for the cold, miserable flat I was living in, sleeping on a mattress on the floor. I went from living hand-to-mouth to flying on Concorde, staying in posh hotels and living in New York. Because I had come from a relatively prosperous background, I adapted within about 0.3 of a second. It was harder for Jimmy [Somerville, his bandmate] who had had none of that. My manager, who was very prudent and the best thing that ever happened to me, arranged for me to have a deposit of £80 a week paid into my account from my company account. When you’ve been on the dole, this is ample. She knew very well that 22-year-olds are probably not the best custodians of riches and so she passed documents in front of me, which I signed. I later found out, to my enormous relief, they had been pension schemes. She had conned me into starting one. Praise be! I like the idea of inspiring characters provided that they return a flattering image, though they don’t always! It is very easy not to be famous and I have made choices that have meant I am, so clearly I am pursuing something I like. What I have learnt is to see it less as something to feed the bonfire of my vanity (though that is still burning) but more as a means of getting some leverage for the things that I am involved in: my work around the parish, housing and our local university, all of which are very important to me. If you had a hit record in the 1980s, you were extremely well rewarded. But over the decades I have done better out of other things such as public speaking. I was very active on the speaker circuit pre-Covid. In the past year I have had a 75pc drop in income. But I liked it. I realised I don’t need very much. My biggest item of expenditure in 2020 was cheese. Both. I came away [from pop stardom] with two lasting benefits, thanks to my brilliant manager Laura. One was my pension scheme and the other was property. I eventually bought a house in Islington in the 1980s which I sold for what I paid for it, an incredibly poorly timed realisation of an asset. But I ended my 20s with a good pension and was mortgage free, which is very lucky. Recently I have become very interested in watches. Maybe it is about conserving time. Maybe it’s to do with my age or bereavement. But if I were to become rich again, I might indulge myself in a beautiful watch. I don’t want anything flash. Something quiet but exquisitely engineered that only aficionados would get. A tip-top Grand Seiko, probably. I like it more and more. I am not a wizard of finance but I do understand a bit about it. I am now on the board of various organisations and have been very active in our local housing association. So I have a responsibility for reading balance sheets. At first I thought they were impenetrable and dull and then I realised that this is how stuff happens: the proper custodianship of money has enabled us to build houses for people who needed them. And that’s a wonderful thing. It’s not just about money, it’s about everything. You become a person of substance when you start taking responsibility for things. And in a very significant way how we handle money expresses and determines who we are. I like spending but I am getting better at saving. But I do like having the resources: I have a mum whose care is expensive. My late partner’s care was expensive, too. I was fortunate I had the resources to fund that. No. It brings freedom from stuff that causes misery; and not to suffer want is a wonderful thing. Lots of people are not made happy by money; it is very easy to think the more you have, the better off you are. My last parish was in Knightsbridge and I was dealing with people who were unhappy with their relationships, or worried about the future. But because they were so rich they felt they were doing everything right. Sometimes you had to say: put that to one side and look at what is actually troubling you.  "

Thousands at risk of criminal gangs as use of financial safeguards plummets
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/thousands-risk-criminal-gangs-use-financial-safeguards-plummets/,"Thousands of elderly people are threatened by a rising tide of fraud because of an “alarming” drop in the use of one of the key financial safeguards for vulnerable people. The number of “ ” registered at the Office of the Public Guardian since the pandemic began in April last year fell by 30pc to fewer than 570,000 at the end of February from 804,000 for the same period a year previously, figures obtained via the Freedom of Information Act showed. In response, the Ministry of Justice said it would consult on how to overhaul and modernise the system to make the application process faster and protect more people from fraud and abuse. Lasting powers of attorney are legal safeguards that allow elderly, disabled or vulnerable people to appoint family members or friends to manage their money when they are unable to do so confidently or lack the mental capacity to do it themselves. They offer a vital layer of protection against financial abuse by criminal gangs or unscrupulous individuals. They also allow relations or other carers to take control of someone’s finances should they become too ill to manage their own affairs. This includes becoming incapacitated by Covid-19. Rachael Griffin of Quilter, the financial advice firm, said the figures were “alarming and a cause for concern”. “There is a serious risk that a lot of people are being left exposed to a number of dangers, potentially for an extended period of time. There is definitely a danger that something untoward can occur,” she said. She said the fall in the use of LPAs was caused in part by the pandemic, which had made it harder for people to gather the relevant paperwork and supporting evidence, such as medical records, to obtain the legal permissions. The number of applications for LPAs has fallen by 25pc since April last year but the number issued has been further reduced by delays at the OPG, the government department that oversees power of attorney arrangements. Once someone loses the capacity to manage their own money – if they develop dementia or serious mental health problems or fall into a coma, for example – it is too late to put an LPA in place. In these circumstances families must resort to obtaining legal permissions via the Court of Protection, which is far more onerous, time consuming and costly. The OPG said it recognised that the pandemic had made it more difficult to get protections in place and said it had published guidance last April on how to do this safely while maintaining social distancing. It added that it had extended its working times to help reduce delays in processing applications. This comes amid the  , combined with rising levels of financial vulnerability. Fraudsters used the pandemic to steal a record £479m from almost 150,000 victims in 2020. Criminals used fake texts, phone calls and other ruses to steal 5pc more cash through money transfer scams than in 2019, according to figures from UK Finance, the banking trade body. Gangs have used coronavirus to their advantage and are increasingly targeting vulnerable people who have been confined to their homes. A total of 1.4 million adults say they have handed over money as a result of a suspected scam during the coronavirus crisis. People regarded as vulnerable are far more susceptible to these scammers: around 12pc have handed over money to con artists, compared with just 1pc of those not regarded as vulnerable, according to the Financial Conduct Authority, the City watchdog. Almost 30 million adults have some degree of vulnerability, up from 24  million before the pandemic began, the watchdog said. There are two main types of power of attorney. Property and financial LPAs give your chosen carer the power to manage your bank account, pay the bills, collect your pension and sell your home in your stead, should you be unable to do so yourself. Health and welfare LPAs allow attorneys to make decisions about your daily routine, medical care, whether you live in care or not and life-sustaining treatment. Each type costs £82 to register. A government spokesman said: “Applications for lasting powers of attorney are increasing and we expect them to be close to pre-pandemic levels shortly.”"

Deliveroo chiefs blame market volatility for debut disaster
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/03/deliveroo-chiefs-blame-market-volatility-debut-disaster/,"Deliveroo bosses have sought to underpin morale at the takeaway app by blaming “a highly volatile market” for its   as a public company. Adam Miller, chief financial officer, wrote to staff urging them to focus on the future rather than the “negative headlines” generated by   on its first day of trading. The loss of more than £2bn from the opening valuation ranked as one of the worst ever debuts on the London Stock Exchange. Mr Miller said: “Don’t underestimate Deliveroo. We have gone public in a highly volatile market. “This volatility has been exacerbated on day one. If operating as a public company were a ‘one day’ event, there would certainly be cause for concern. [But] that is the opposite of what being a public company is about.” Higher volatility in the markets typically means larger swings in share prices. It has been increased by the massive uncertainties of the pandemic. However, in recent weeks a calmer atmosphere has prevailed and the VIX index, a closely watched measure of US stock market volatility, is at its lowest level since February 2020. Mr Miller also linked its troubles to the  , which rattled markets and is expected to lead to losses of up to $10bn (£7.2bn) for the international banks which fuelled its trading with debt. Deliveroo compared its performance to recent declines in the shares of takeaway rivals such as Just Eat Takeway.com and DoorDash. Investors have backed off as the lockdowns that have powered growth begin to be eased. As he sought to lift spirits, Mr Miller insisted Deliveroo “is in great shape” with £1bn in the bank following the float. He made no reference to criticisms by fund managers prior to its debut. Several institutions said they would not invest due to Deliveroo’s treatment of workers, doubts about its business model and threats from rivals."

Big Issue’s ‘sustainable’ investing arm criticised for offering oil, coal and weapons
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/isas/big-issues-sustainable-investing-arm-criticised-offering-oil/,"A sustainable investment website launched last year and co-founded by The Big Issue has been criticised for recommending funds which invest in coal, oil and Grenfell-style cladding. The Big Exchange said it wanted to “create positive solutions to combat the world’s biggest challenges”. But funds were found to include investments in  , and others failed to rule out investing in companies that fund weapons and commit human rights abuses, according to independent research commissioned by the website itself. The research was intended to help illustrate the difficulty of finding investments which are completely free of harm. It also showed two competing methods of sustainable investment: investing in companies promising to change and making use of shareholder votes to make sure they do, or excluding them entirely. Jill Jackson, of the Big Exchange, said its aim was to be transparent and let consumers choose. In contrast to most fund shops, which offer a top-10 list of holdings, its participating funds must be clear on all their investments. Unlike self-described ethical funds, which avoid certain companies or industries, the Big Exchange said it looked for funds which invest in companies which had made positive contributions to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals “and then flags the potential issues that may occur around that”, Ms Jackson said. “That's a different starting point.” It could mean investing in a company that uses some coal or oil today, but will move to greener fuels. Most energy companies selling electricity from the grid have struggled to avoid small sales of coal and oil-generated power, for instance. The company asked a research firm to examine the funds and create warnings so users would know what the risks were. One such summary, for the Liontrust Sustainable Future Cautious Managed fund reads: “The fund invests in companies whose corporate practices are widely considered to have damaging impacts on wider society” and that it holds companies “providing services or products used in  , attack vehicles or missile systems.” Asked whether such warnings were too vague or off-putting to help a would-be investor, Ms Jackson said: “I do believe that we can improve on that. We’re a young business; it's a starting point for us and I think that what you'll find is that we're one of the few investment firms that are highlighting anything like that to consumers.” Liontrust said it does not invest in any company that makes more than 5pc of sales from weapons, thus avoiding large defence firms. It did not agree with the research’s assessment about harms to society. “We go to considerable lengths to ensure we have exceptionally low exposure to companies which have damaging impacts on wider society,” it said, adding it planned to work with Big Exchange to provide more detail on its funds. Another fund, Pictet Global Thematic Opportunities, listed a holding in , which made 5pc of the insulation on Grenfell Tower. At the end of last year, the inquiry into the 2017 fire heard Kingspan had rigged fire safety tests, an allegation it contests. Pictet said it had sold the holding since the report was released in September.  The Big Exchange website said: “The fund has no formal screens which would stop it investing in companies which raise ethical issues such as animal testing, human rights abuses, fossil fuels and gambling.” Pictet said it had asked the Big Exchange to amend this wording and that it had a “rigorous responsible investment policy”.  And while Pictet Clean Energy had “excluded companies that have significant exposure to fossil fuel use,” it does invest “in power producers whose sources of power include coal, oil or gas; or in distributors or wholesalers of fossil fuels; or in companies providing services for the production of oil and gas,” according to Big Exchange research. Pictet said: “Our Clean Energy strategy invests in the energy transition to a low carbon economy by focusing on: renewable energy, energy efficiency, critical enabling technologies and infrastructure.” Dean Buckner, a volunteer for the Savers Take Control project at the UK Shareholders Association and who spotted the investments, said there was no substitute for savers doing their own due diligence."

Amazon apologises for denying drivers are forced to urinate in bottles
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/04/04/amazon-apologises-denying-drivers-forced-urinate-bottles/,"Amazon has admitted that its drivers are sometimes forced to urinate in bottles while making deliveries. The online retailer retracted a statement it made to a US politician in which it incorrectly denied the allegation. The tech giant used its Twitter account to reply to a post by US representative Mark Pocan. Mr Pocan criticised Amazon for claiming to be a “progressive workplace” while making “workers urinate in water bottles”. Amazon replied to the Tweet from March 25, saying: “You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us.” However, that denial led to a backlash which has seen multiple investigations and articles featuring accounts from its drivers saying they are forced to relieve themselves while on the road due to time pressures and traffic. Amazon admitted its response had been “an own goal … we owe an apology”. The company said the post was “incorrect. It did not contemplate our large driver population”. “We know that drivers can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or rural routes, and this has been especially the case during Covid when many public restrooms have been closed.” However, the company claimed it was an “industry-wide” issue, before citing examples from rival companies. Amazon added: “Regardless of the fact that this is industry wide, we would like to solve it. We don’t yet know how, but will look for solutions. “We will continue to speak out when misrepresented, but we will also work hard to always be accurate.” Mr Pocan, the representative for Wisconsin, rejected the apology saying Amazon workers were not treated with enough “respect or dignity”.

London-based Zedsen said it had secured $12m in funding from a group of high net-worth investors including Nasser Kazeminy, a multimillionaire businessman, and Robert Priddy, a low-cost-airline mogul. The company, which is chaired by the former BAE Systems President Sir Charles Masefield, has also poached Caroline Hargrove, the chief technology officer of British health-tech company Babylon. Ms Hargrove, seen as one of Britain’s top female engineers, will become Zedsen’s chief technology officer as it seeks to start selling a personal device that will act as a personal doctor by monitoring readings such as blood glucose, pressure and sodium levels. The company hopes its technology will become a preventative care system that could ultimately detect diabetes early or see how different foods affect metabolism, limiting the effects of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, which are the two biggest causes of death resulting from lifestyle choices. Zedsen’s sensor technology involves a flexible membrane that creates a harmless electrical field, allowing it to detect the composition of tissue under the skin. The technology is also a potential candidate for detecting breast tumours, and has developed a sensor for conducting screening check-ups. The company plans to sell a consumer-grade wearable device next year for reading blood levels, with a companion app that will see users pay a subscription for extra insights. Zedsen, which was founded in 2015, has raised more than $20m in total and counts John Sculley, the former Apple chief executive, as a strategic advisor.

,business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/04/04/amazons-union-battle-omen-future-conflict/,"For the last two weeks, the city of Bessemer in Alabama, a former mining and steel town, has been at the centre of a heated row over the future of labour. Just a year after Amazon opened a giant warehouse in the city, workers at the facility have mounted one of the most substantial efforts in the company’s history to form a union. Voting on the plan ended last week, and results are expected in the coming days. If union campaigners are successful, the immediate impact will be relatively small. Amazon has more than 1m workers, just 6,000 of them work at the Bessemer facility. But the implications of the vote, whichever way it goes, will be greater. Politicians including Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, as well as actors and sports stars, have wedged themselves into the debate. Amazon executives, who had initially sought not to draw attention to the unionisation effort, have recently changed tactics and gone on the offensive against its detractors, reportedly at Jeff Bezos’s bidding. This all illustrates the high stakes involved: if Amazon wins, it is likely to quiet further unionisation efforts for some time; if it loses, Bessemer could become the first of many. But the reasons behind the employees’ campaign also hints at a brewing friction between staff and their paymasters that goes far beyond Amazon itself. The gripes of Amazon’s warehouse workers (or “fulfillment associates” as the company calls them) – are not those most typically associated with labour movements. Staff are  , double the minimum wage, and benefits such as healthcare and retirement contributions are above average for the pay grade. The job is physical and tiring, but not obviously more so than similar jobs at other companies. Amazon itself has made such arguments in ubiquitous notices and regular meetings at the centre in an attempt to discourage support for the union. But multiple workers campaigning against the company have a different complaint: the way they are managed by machines, not humans. I have been on (pre-pandemic)  , put on by the company to demonstrate how, contrary to common criticism, its centres are safe, as well as beacons of innovation. This appears to be the case: , when adjusted for age and location. But the centres have an unnerving, robotic quality. Literally in one sense: the centres are packed with moving, bookcase-like robots that ferry stacks of items to the human “pickers” that load them for packing. But also due to the hyper-efficient, software-driven way that the cavernous warehouses operate. Repeatedly, employee complaints about Amazon appear not to focus on more tangible issues such as pay, but on the feeling like they are cogs in a machine. Workers are continuously tracked: at the start of a shift they log into a machine that proceeds to measure how many items they pick an hour, and their accumulated “time off task”: the accumulated minutes and seconds not spent at a workstation. Staff say it can be unclear what targets they are meant to hit, and struggle to get an answer, since so much of their interaction with the company happens through a smartphone app rather than a manager. Despite having thousands of colleagues, one common complaint is loneliness on the job, a sensation amplified by constant surveillance. , not only in its massive retail logistics network but at head office too. An ongoing programme called Hands Off The Wheel has replaced white collar tasks such as making product orders. When it comes to its delivery network, it is installing cameras in vans that use artificial intelligence to check for drowsy drivers and other potential hazards. Opposition to this is distinct from often-repeated fears that widespread automation and robotics will render humans obsolete and lead to mass unemployment. These concerns have existed for centuries, and have rarely been justified. Staff are typically assigned new roles where they accomplish things machines cannot. But if anxieties that we will be replaced by robots have been overblown, Amazon shows us an alternative where we are managed by them. The company is typically early to such practices; many others are following in its steps. This is most evident in gig economy companies that outsource work to armies of non-employees using smartphone apps to complete tasks. Uber, for example, argues that its employment model allows drivers to be their own boss; drivers themselves say it feels as if the app’s algorithm is the one in charge. Many independent artists and influencers who rely on social media for a living have found themselves worse off by a small tweak in a social network’s code that sends their audience plummeting. The more that data is collected and software improves, the likelier it is that the rest of us will have an element of algorithmic oversight in our own jobs. In theory, being managed by software could be liberating and meritocratic: while bosses play favourites, we are all equal in the eye of the algorithm. In reality, it can mean being governed by incomprehensible decisions and processes. There is, no doubt, more to Amazon’s union dispute than this. But the company’s embrace of automation had a part to play. It may be a glimpse at the future of work."

Mr Dembik said: “Even with a strong rebound in activity from early May onwards, the tighter April lockdown will weigh heavily … the drop in activity will mostly affect the service sector, which partly relies on face-to-face interactions.” The latest shutdown is also likely to delay France’s recovery until the second half of the year and trigger a third successive quarter of shrinking growth, Oxford Economics economist Daniela Ordonez said.  She called the vaccine a “cold shower” for the French economy, tipping it from modest growth to a likely fall of 1pc between April and June.  “In the short-term it will have a direct impact because the schools will be closed, something which was not the case last November, and that will constrain the labour force because parents will be forced to take care of children,"" Ms Ordonez said. “It is kind of a failure of the French government in the Covid-19 fight. Infection has not been controlled, which is why we are entering this kind of lockdown, and the government has waited too much to impose restrictions to curb the infection. Hospital capacity is reaching its peak and has been for the past three or four weeks. It is more of a disappointment than a surprise.” Mr Macron,  has overseen almost 100,000 deaths as the deadlier South African and Kent variants spread through France.  He pledged to speed up a vaccination programme that has covered just 12pc of the population amid red-tape and shortages, but also caused consternation by questioning the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine earlier this year.     Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics said the restrictions could also damage the important domestic tourism industry, which may now not be fully open ""until June or July"". The resilience of France’s manufacturing sector has limited the overall damage of the pandemic after figures from data firm IHS Markit showed the fastest growth for its private sector in more than two decades. Markit’s purchasing manager index, where a score over 50 signals growth, jumped from 56.1 to 59.3 in March, signalling the fastest improvement in the health of French manufacturers since September 2000. Eliot Kerr, IHS Markit economist, said that while “the pandemic is still very much alive, these results show that manufacturing conditions are on the path to recovery”. The wider eurozone is also enjoying a manufacturing boom although supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic –  – has caused rising prices and delays, the firm added."

Hiring surges but London is left behind
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/01/hiring-surges-london-left-behind/,"More jobs are available now than at any point since the pandemic struck as companies limber up to reopen over the coming months – but the capital continues to lag the rest of country.  Online adverts are back up to 94pc of their pre-Covid level, with more vacancies now on offer in some areas and industries than there were before the first lockdown. However London, with its relatively low share of manufacturing and higher reliance on currently absent commuters, is still behind the rest of the country. Vacancies in the capital are still around 20pc below their pre-Covid level, making it firmly the weakest performer so far in this putative recovery. Nationally, factories are particularly keen to hire, with almost 60pc more positions available now than in February 2020, according to Adzuna and the Office for National Statistics. This chimes with the purchasing managers’ survey from IHS Markit, which shows activity in manufacturing grew at Surging demand from domestic and foreign customers is pushing up hiring. Retailers and hospitality firms also need to recruit before they open their doors again. “The domestic market remained the prime source of new orders, as companies reported that the vaccine rollout and clients’ preparations for the loosening of lockdown restrictions underpinned the expansion,” said Rob Dobson at IHS Markit. “Many expect this process to be supportive during the year ahead as well, raising business optimism and jobs growth to their highest levels for seven years.” Hiring in healthcare is just below its pre-Covid levels, while vacancies in education are around 10pc below. Wholesale and retail jobs are showing some improvement, back at two-thirds of their level in February 2020 - the strongest showing since Christmas - while  at just over one-third of usual hiring. This marks the strongest number of vacancies since early Autumn, before the November lockdown forced more bars and restaurants to close their doors again. By region, there are more positions now on offer in swathes of the country than there were pre-pandemic, including in Northern Ireland, the North West, North East and South West of England, as well as the Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber. Businesses expect the situation to improve as the economy reopens, according to the Bank of England’s survey of private sector leaders. It reported fading fears that employment will fall over the next year. It also found companies predicting that investment, which has been depressed by Covid, could end up being higher next year than would have been the case without the pandemic, indicating some rebound could take place. Hospitality businesses have suffered the most under lockdown but look set to embark on the biggest investment push next year."

Facebook plans undersea cables with Google to boost south-east Asia internet
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/03/29/facebook-plans-undersea-cables-google-boost-south-east-asia/,"Facebook is planning to build two new undersea internet cables between south-east Asia and North America to boost connections across the Pacific. The social media giant said it hopes to have both cables up and running by 2024, working with Google and local telecoms providers to create a new digital bridge between Singapore, Indonesia and the United States. Tech companies are increasingly helping fund the undersea cables that connect emerging markets to their US servers. Last year, a separate connection to Hong Kong was blocked last year by the Trump administration over security concerns. Kevin Salvadori, Facebook's vice president of network investments, told Reuters the new cables would be the first direct connections between North America and parts of Indonesia, which is the company's fifth biggest market and an increasingly important source of growth. One cable, called Echo, is a partnership between Facebook, Google and the Indonesian telecoms provider XL Axiata, while the other, Bifrost, involves Telkom, another Indonesian carrier, and Keppel, a Singaporean conglomerate. Mr Salvadori said: ""Those will be the first two cables to go through a new diverse route crossing the Java Sea, and they will increase overall subsea capacity in the trans-Pacific by about 70pc."" He added that the cables would require ""a very material investment"" from Facebook. They will still require regulatory approval. Indonesia is a big market for Facebook, with an estimated 130m users and widespread internet use but very few wired broadband connections,  . The Asia-Pacific region is one of Facebook's fastest-growing sources of revenue, accelerating by 31pc in the last three months of 2020 and an average of 27pc over the past two years. As well as the new cables, Facebook said last year that it would build 1,864 miles of fibre optic broadband linking 20 Indonesian cities, as well as a series of new public Wi-Fi hotspots. Indonesia is also regularly named in Facebook's annual reports as  , and as well as fake news and harassment campaigns from so-called ""hoax factories"", often targeting religious and sexual minorities.  by the human rights consultancy BSR warned that the company's response had been ""slow and at times insufficient"" before 2018, which may have contribute to violations of rights.

US adds almost 1m jobs in March as Biden boom gains momentum 
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/02/us-jobs-surge-biden-boom-gains-momentum/,"US employers added almost 1m jobs last month as vaccines and President Biden’s $1.9 trillion (£1.4 trillion) stimulus keeps the world’s biggest economy on track for a Reagan-era boom this year. The 916,000 Americans hired in March was far greater than the 660,000 forecast and the highest for seven months, taking the unemployment rate down to 6pc.  The figures showed a broad-based recovery led by a 280,000 surge in leisure and hospitality jobs as states gradually loosened Covid restrictions. The March revival still leaves the US more than 8m jobs short of its February 2020 peak, but the combination of the rapid vaccine rollout, $1,400 stimulus cheques and infrastructure spending are expected to pour rocket fuel on the economy this year. Almost 40pc of America's adult population has been vaccinated. The Federal Reserve predicts growth of 6.5pc in 2021, the best since 1984 and almost twice as fast as the eurozone economy struggling to vaccinate and succumbing to a third wave. Chairman Jay Powell has also warned that the Covid recovery was “far from complete” and pledged to keep monetary policy ultra-loose in a further tailwind to the economic revival. The latest Fed forecasts suggest rate-setters will keep interest rates at record lows until at least 2023. But James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said the gathering jobs market momentum could force the central bank’s hand. “It's not inconceivable that all the jobs lost during the pandemic are regained before year-end, which if the case it would mean Federal Reserve rate hikes could come as soon as next year,"" he said. ""A 2022 rate hike is more likely than a 2024 first move.”  Alongside bars and restaurants, construction firms took on 110,000 workers after bad winter weather while manufacturers hired an extra 53,000 - the highest tally since September. However, the sheer size of the monetary and fiscal stimulus being turned on the US economy has also prompted warnings of inflation from prominent figures including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. President Biden’s $2 trillion American Jobs Plan, partly funded by corporate tax rises, is also set to create millions of jobs in construction and renewing the country's creaking infrastructure and tackling climate change.  Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics said: “Particular segments of the labor market - like leisure & hospitality and education - remain weak because of the ongoing restrictions, but the opposite is true in many other sectors. The upshot is that an acceleration in wage growth in those better-placed sectors could add to the upward pressure on prices this year.”"

How to reverse ageing Britain and ease pressure on its public finances
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/21/reverse-ageing-britain-ease-pressure-public-finances/,"Scotland is attempting to turn back the clock to save its economy. With an older population and a far lower fertility rate than the rest of the UK, Scotland risks becoming the country’s ageing epicentre. Mortality, fertility and migration was the three-pronged approach targeted in Holyrood’s first population strategy last week as it battles to de-age its workforce. Like much of the developed world, policymakers in Edinburgh are threatened with a fast ageing population that will slash the workforce, drain public money and spark a social care crisis. Scotland’s new strategy warned that an arsenal of weapons rather than a “silver bullet” will be needed as Covid worsens the problem. Widened access to pricey fertility treatment, incentives for families to set up in Scotland, and encouraging older people to   were among a package of measures proposed. But can such policies do enough to reverse the ageing of Britain’s population? While the extension of life expectancy has been a major medical achievement, it is causing headaches for economists. “A lot of people are really underestimating how massive the changes are in the demographic outlook for pretty much every country in the world,” says James Pomeroy, HSBC economist. “Over the course of the next decade, it will be the fastest pace of change of demographics globally that we’ve probably ever seen, and we’ll ever see, because we’re at this turning point.”  from being a tailwind for many economies to a major headwind as populations age. Developed economies will see their working age population shrink, but their older cohorts expand rapidly as the large baby boomer generation retires and lives for longer. The huge increases in life expectancy is a key driver of ageing populations, but economic forces are also at play. “The point about low wage jobs, low productivity [and] jobs with low social status is that it means often that people struggle to start families,” explains prof Adrian Pabst, deputy director at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). “Families either get delayed or never happen at all because they simply cannot afford it… wages are a huge area of concern here.” An ageing population means slower GDP growth, but higher public spending and a smaller tax base. Population is an important driver of economic activity with gains creating a larger workforce and consumer demand. “Scotland’s business base, the domestic customers that provide them with demand, and the workforce required to supply that demand are all derived from its resident population,” the population strategy explained. The Scottish government expects to suffer “significantly lower” increases in GDP than the rest of the UK because of its weaker population growth, while Japan’s shrinking working force   as labour shortages bite. A declining workforce means a smaller tax base that will struggle to raise enough revenue to pay for  . A worker aged 45 in the UK on average provides the most tax revenue to the state and takes out very little in public spending. That switches when that worker becomes elderly as their pension, social care and health costs sap money from the state. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that age-related spending is set to climb from 23pc of GDP in 2025 to 26.2pc in 2065, a rise sharper than any of the eurozone “big four” of France, Germany, Italy and Spain. A typical UK 89-year-old in 2021-22 is estimated to cost the state more than £30,000 a year, while the 45-year-old costs just £6,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. “The British state is changing shape to respond to pressures from the ageing boomer cohort,” warns Lord Willetts, the president of the Resolution Foundation’s intergenerational centre and a former Conservative minister. “What you see is an increase in NHS spend and an increase in pension spend. We become a health and pensions state and other services tend to fall away by comparison.”  is set to push the UK’s tax burden to 35pc of GDP, its highest level since the Sixties. But paying for an older population will likely mean Britons face  . “In the absence of any other change, it’s hard to see where else it could come from,” warns Pabst. He says the alternative is an insurance system that workers pay into, helping to cover care costs later on in life. Like many of the economic challenges facing policymakers, the pandemic threatens to amplify the problem. A  , with estimates suggesting that Britain’s birth rate may have fallen to record lows. HSBC believes the pandemic could mean the global population peaks a decade earlier than previously expected in the early 2050s, with huge implications for economies. The UK is still far from the full-blown population crises facing the likes of Japan. It remains middle of the pack in terms of fertility rates among developed economies, but will still endure huge population pressures. Pomeroy predicts the UK’s working age population could be declining this decade and will “certainly be shrinking in the 2030s”. If the UK’s fertility rate fell from its current level of 1.7 births per woman to around 1.2 or 1.3, levels currently seen in Spain and Italy, the population would almost halve by 2100 if there was no immigration, he estimates. “It actually could happen, these demographic risks are so underestimated,” Pomeroy warns. There are solutions that could at least cushion the economic blow, but they are unpopular, slow and long-term. Politicians have largely preferred to kick the can down the road than grasp the nettle. The easiest and quickest solution is to raise the retirement age, delaying the point that state pensions kick in and encouraging people to work for longer. More office-based employment and improving health makes extending working lives more viable, but it is fiercely unpopular. The UK’s state pension age will rise to 67 later this decade, while retirement age increases in other countries have knocked governments’ popularity. “You could just reduce the value of state pensions or not increase it so rapidly,” adds David Sturrock, economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. He warns the current “triple lock” that ensures pensions increase by the highest of earnings, prices or 2.5pc is “unsustainable” in the long term. Boosting immigration levels to bring in young workers that start families could also ease the pressure. While many developed economies face shrinking workforces, populations in many parts of the world are still growing rapidly. “Nigeria, Egypt, Philippines [and] India - these countries have got very fast growing populations,” says Pomeroy. “Migration could be theoretically a global solution, but as we know, that isn’t necessarily practical or politically popular in various parts of the world.” The holy grail for policymakers would be reviving fertility rates, but reversing decades-long trends could prove difficult. Boosting the number of births per woman would lift the number of young workers entering the labour market and widen the tax base to ease the pressure on the public finances. Economists argue that reducing childcare costs and bolstering the financial security of younger generations are vital in lifting births. “You really need to incentivize people and make the costs lower, which is what generally happened in Scandinavia,” says Pomeroy. With Scotland’s low fertility rate of 1.4, its new strategy included several measures to shore up young families. More affordable homes, support packages for families settling in Scotland, and expanding fertility treatment to groups such as single people and couples who already have a child are proposals being drawn up to de-age the population. Scotland is taking the first step towards solving its brewing population crisis but policymakers may need to be far more ambitious to turn back the clock."

Crispin Odey’s troubles shine a spotlight on City’s hedonistic past
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/28/crispin-odeys-troubles-shine-spotlight-citys-hedonistic-past/,"The financial elite were having a very good time in 1998, the year Lord Mandelson said Labour was “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich” as long as they pay their taxes. “It was before hedge funds were institutionalised. It was normal for everyone to behave appallingly all the time – hard drinking, hard smoking, loads of recreational drugs. This was the time Mayfair started to become cool again,” says one executive. “Mayfair was a total backwater.” But what is considered cool one decade is less so in another. The small number of women who worked in finance during those years do not look back fondly on the “good old days” of a gilded era. “Women being humiliated in this country is part of upper class culture,” says one senior businesswoman who has bad memories of that time. “These are ruthless people who are part of a ruthless system which is there to deny people their economic freedom.” One of the biggest characters from the buccaneering late 1990s and early 2000s is  , once dubbed one half of the “Posh and Becks” of the City and a regular at celebrity Mayfair members’ club 5 Hertford Street. After making £220m on the night of the Brexit vote with a bet that markets would fall, the Brexiteer turned to an Italian proverb to express his delight the following morning. “Il mattino ha l’oro in bocca” – the morning has gold in its mouth – he told the BBC. But much of that glow has since come off his fortunes.   and in the past few months he has been battling   dating back to 1998. He was   earlier this month, with district judge Nicholas Rimmer questioning why he had been charged after a decision not to prosecute him was overturned by a victim review. The woman claimed   put his hands on her breast and up her skirt before she “wrestled herself free and left”. Odey said he propositioned her after he “misread the signals” but did not grope her. New allegations have since surfaced. Last week Bloomberg News reported accusations of inappropriate behaviour from two unnamed sources, a former receptionist at his firm who claims Odey used to run his hand down her back when she was at work and a former client who alleges she was asked by Odey to be his mistress in exchange for the use of his flat during a business dinner over a decade ago. Odey’s spokesman says he denies all the allegations and will be instigating legal action against them. The claims nevertheless shine a spotlight on Britain’s hedge fund industry during an era of excess. One senior businesswoman says she feels the Mayfair set will always bat away claims of sexism and harassment simply as “a lunch gone wrong”. Odey admits that he may not have noticed the cultural changes going on around him in recent years as the male-dominated finance sector finally began to modernise. He is known throughout the Square Mile as one of the last of a City old guard fond of a long lunch. At one midweek meal with an   journalist, he paired steak and kidney pudding and mash with a “side order” of a loin of beef and two bottles of wine. “Things change, if you’re running a business for 30 years you sometimes don’t see how much the world is changing culturally. There is a bit of   in that,” he says. “There are definitely improvements we can make in our culture. [But] what we do in our private life does not affect our professional life. It’s a point of view.” Despite being acquitted, now aged 62 the financier faces having to rebuild his reputation. In the secretive hedge fund industry, reputation is everything. The amount Odey personally manages shrank to around $777m (£558m) at the end of last year, according to an investor letter seen by Bloomberg. Odey Asset Management, the company he founded in 1991, even changed the name of around £1.3bn worth of funds from “Odey” to “Brook” in the weeks before he was acquitted. Odey claims his business has been unaffected by the court case. “At the moment everyone wants to kill Odey but we have a resilient brand,” he argues. “I’ve had all the diversions of this court case, and all the kiss and tell stories, but we’re having a fantastic time across the board – our funds have grown by 30pc this year”. His male supporters – including one who recalls watching him get slapped in the face at an event – argue that nobody should be judged in this “intense, really sensitive climate” for things they did decades ago. “Now he seems like a figure out of time,” one said. “People flourish in different ages.” Robin Birley, the owner of 5 Hertford Street, insists his friend has never been banned from the club despite rumours that he was not seen there for some months in 2014 after being caught in a compromising position by a member of staff. “Crispin is both a personal friend and a valued member of 5 Hertford Street. “There is no truth at all in the claim that he has ever been banned from the club,” he says. Odey told the   in 2014 that the incident was a “joke spread by a friend”. Odey Asset Management’s website – which shows an all-male research team, male-only portfolio managers (of which half are also Oxford graduates) and just one woman on its management team – suggests it remains a relic of a bygone era. Many hope the hedonistic boys’ club where wealthy financiers such as Odey once felt so at home will finally begin to change."

Fenwick aiming to be the last department store standing
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/03/fenwick-aiming-last-department-store-standing/,"The boss of Fenwick was busy last week adding finishing touches to the family-owned department store chain’s reopening plans.  has brought shop staff back from furlough, added new clothing and furniture brands and is preparing to launch a vegan restaurant by a Michelin-starred chef in one of its stores. “We’re expecting a good opening, but we’re expecting a slow recovery as well,” says Edgar, who was appointed chief executive last April. “I don’t think there’s going to be this big, huge jump.” His brief is to return the retailer,  , to profitability in the most challenging market in memory. Its most recent accounts for the year to the end of January 2020 losses widened from £44m to £47m for the year to the end of Jan 2020. It made £2m profit the year before that.  It has also taken out a £40m loan from Lloyds in June, which the company says it hasn’t drawn on, and has a pension deficit of £28.5m. Some industry observers believe that Fenwick, which owns some valuable properties, will pull the trigger on sale and leaseback deals to place itself on a firmer financial footing. Last year it got the nod of approval from authorities to turn the upper levels of its Bond Street store in London into offices,  . “That kicked off every developer in the Western world looking at it to buy it,” says one property source. Edgar, who previously was a senior adviser at Boston Consulting Group and held executive roles at Harrods and Selfridges, says there are no plans to sell any freeholds – currently. “One of the reasons why I was attracted to come here is because of the financial strength of the organisation,” he says. “Compared to most retailers, we’ve got a very strong balance sheet and no debt.” He added: “We have over half a billion of unencumbered assets, we’ve got cash in the bank – less cash now than we did before Christmas – but we’ve got ample facilities to get us through whatever we foresee happening. The assets, we can leverage if we have to.” The 50-year-old says he is also comfortable with the pension deficit, a legacy of the sort of generous final salary scheme that has tripped over some retailers. In recent years trustees, as well as the pension watchdog, have been getting more savvy with their demands to ensure payments can be made or cash can be recovered. Edgar says that an independent trustee has deemed Fenwick’s scheme “strong or tending to be very strong” and there is no pension security over its properties. The 138-year-old retailer has also had to contend with the shift to online shopping, which caught it off guard. When Edgar joined, the website was “embryonic”, while most of its rivals have managed to offset the losses from consecutive store closures through internet orders. The Fenwick family unceremoniously replaced its top brass last April and drafted him in, saying the changes would bring the family closer to the day-to-day running of the business. “One of the things we focused on [in lockdown] is just being better at what we should be doing, because there have been some good practices and some less good practices in the business – and that’s life,” Edgar says. Within six weeks of reopening its website to orders, Fenwick took more online sales than it had done in the whole of 2019. Retail pundits are less bullish and believe that getting e-commerce to contribute to sales and profit in a meaningful way requires significant investment.   Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, says: “They [Fenwick] have been behind the curve in terms of the digital proposition. This stuff takes millions if not hundreds of millions to get right.” He argues it will become more commonplace for department store chains, and retailers more broadly, to embark on sale and leaseback deals. “Companies that have significant assets on their balance sheet, but don’t have enough cash to invest in this stuff, they do a leaseback. It’s the obvious way to raise capital and make use of space.” Waitrose, for example, the sister business of struggling John Lewis, has been cashing in on its freeholds to raise money. During 2020, it accumulated £136m from the sale and leaseback of 11 stores. Similar to John Lewis and Marks & Spencer, Fenwick has also jumped on the brands bandwagon and has added 140 new labels to its offering over the last 12 months. Lim points out that such moves are not enough to lure customers to shops. “They can’t just be there distributing other people’s products. They need to find a unique selling point.” Edgar disagrees: “As you can see, everybody else is dropping out of the high street. It does help that we are one of the few credible premium retailers left in the locations that we trade. We are the main show in town.”"

Sunak cuts tax on Scottish flights to bolster the Union
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/23/sunak-cuts-tax-scottish-flights-bolster-union/,"Rishi Sunak has announced plans to cut taxes for flights to Scotland to boost the “social cohesion of the Union”. A reduction in domestic   will be paid for by an increase in the tax imposed on long-haul flights - prompting criticism from the owner of British Airways.  Plans being considered include only charging air passenger duty one-way for domestic flights - previously outlawed when the UK was still in the EU - or introducing a lower band for domestic flights. “Domestic connectivity is a central pillar of the Government’s commitment to supporting the Union and  ,” a consultation published by the Treasury stated. “Domestic connectivity is vital in fostering integration between all parts of the UK and increasing the social cohesion of the Union. Travel by road or rail is not always practical for certain journeys within the UK, and it is important our domestic air network enables those who live in the UK to connect to areas that are otherwise hard to reach.” Aviation levies have been split into two bands: flights to destinations up to 2,000 miles away, and flights travelling more than that distance.  An economy flight from London and Edinburgh with easyJet costs less than £50, for instance. Of this, £13 - more than a quarter of the overall price - is air passenger duty.  Jonathan Hinkles, boss of regional airline Loganair, said: ""We are heartened to see the consultation around the promised changes to air passenger duty, which cannot come a moment too soon for domestic air travel.   ""The ability to make the change is one of very few benefits for the aviation industry from Brexit and it will help to address the significant loss of connectivity throughout all parts of the UK caused by APD."" While the move will be welcomed by some short-haul carriers, it will come as a blow to airlines such as BA that make bigger profits running long-haul services. A spokesman for BA owner IAG said: ""We have always said that APD should be abolished. Given the acute pressure on business, the hike in international APD will make it even harder for UK firms to trade overseas. This is a tax on Global Britain. We will be submitting our views in due course."" Long-haul travel has been hardest hit by the pandemic, with experts predicting that it will be the slowest to recover to pre-pandemic levels.  The Treasury is consulting on proposals to increase the amount of air passenger duty on long-haul flights by doubling the number of bands to four and introducing a frequent flyer levy.  Charging long-haul passengers more were part of what ministers called the “polluter pays principle”.  The consultation read: “Those who travel furthest internationally, and consequently have the greatest impact on the environment, [should] incur the most APD.”"

UK’s OneWeb battles Elon Musk in broadband space race
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/03/27/uks-oneweb-battles-elon-musk-broadband-space-race/,"On opposite sides of the Earth and just hours apart, rockets from satellite companies OneWeb and SpaceX blasted off this week, each delivering a payload of dozens of small satellites into low orbit. British-owned OneWeb,  , fired 36 satellites into space on the nose of a Soyuz rocket from the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia’s far east. Around 6,670 miles away, Elon Musk’s SpaceX shot 60   into the sky from Cape Canaveral on the Florida coast. Musk’s Falcon 9 reusable launchers landed at sea aboard the robotic Of Course I Still Love You ship in the Atlantic. The launches are the latest stage in an accelerating space race between the two companies. Both firms want to blanket the Earth with satellites  . Despite OneWeb securing £400m in government investment, observers have noted SpaceX appears to have gained an early lead. Since January, users in the UK have been able to sign up to a beta trial of SpaceX’s service, installing a satellite dish that links up to one of its satellites circling about 690 miles above the Earth’s surface. Some have reported speeds in excess of 150 megabits per second. For that, they pay £89 per month. By selling these dishes directly to consumers, SpaceX hopes to bypass telcos and shake-up the market. But Neil Masterson, the new chief executive of OneWeb, doesn’t appear fazed. “We are not fighting the industry, but working with them.” OneWeb is hoping to sell to telecoms companies such as BT to reach remote rural locations. Founded in 2012, the company was a pioneer in the design and construction of mega-constellations of hundreds of satellites that could provide global broadband. It raised $3.4bn from the likes of Japan’s SoftBank, but it came unstuck last March when investors pulled the plug on new funding. An unexpected white knight came in the form of the British Government,  , which secured a $1bn deal to buy the remains of the company last year. But by the time OneWeb restarted launches in December, SpaceX had ramped up its own efforts. “OneWeb were the innovators in launching a big constellation,” says Marek Ziebart, a professor at University College London. “With Elon Musk, as typically happens in tech, someone else had burnt the research and development dollars doing the high-risk process of proving something can be done, and once it is done the vultures come down.” Musk’s Starlink now has more than 1,300 satellites in orbit, covering much of the northern hemisphere. In the UK, it offers its service around 50 degrees latitude north and expects to cover Britain by the end of the year. OneWeb’s Masterson says its own service, which as of Thursday morning had 146 satellites in orbit, will provide coverage from the “North Pole to Cornwall” by the end of the year. Rather than going directly to punters, OneWeb is portraying itself as an ally to telecoms companies. “One of our shareholders [Bharti] is one of the largest telcos in the world, and we have an   into every single telco around the world. It is the natural approach for us,” he says. That offer of help will be welcome in very rural areas where the cost of installing fibre is uneconomical. Network insiders believe a company like OneWeb, working on a business-to-business basis, would be useful for providing redundancy to fibre networks, in particular to critical infrastructure. However, many still see it as a niche solution. Some experts also do not believe the ultra high speeds enjoyed by early Starlink customers are sustainable.  With only a few thousand trial customers, high speeds are inevitable. “How this will work with hundreds of thousands of customers is unclear,” one telecoms expert says. Analysts say the ultimate winner in the race for a global constellation remains unclear. “OneWeb certainly lost some of its lead during Chapter 11 proceedings,” says Caleb Henry, an analyst at consultancy Quilty Analytics. “But OneWeb’s smaller constellation means it is not necessarily behind SpaceX.” OneWeb has roughly 22pc of its network complete, Quilty says, compared with about 11pc coverage by Starlink. Masterson says OneWeb is planning between eight and 10 launches this year as it seeks to regain its position against Starlink.  The UK-backed firm has also joined a pushback by satellite companies against Starlink’s vast expansion, which has seen a dash for territory in space – Starlink’s ultimate goal is to have 12,000 satellites over Earth.  In a recent filing to the US communications regulator, OneWeb argued SpaceX’s constellation would cause “harmful interference” and claimed its satellites had a “troubling failure rate” and were “plagued” with safety issues. SpaceX declined to comment. But OneWeb has its own critics. This week, MPs including Darren Jones, the chairman of the business committee, quizzed Prime Minister Boris Johnson over the transparency of the deal, and whether he had been personally involved in brokering it. Mr Johnson said: “I don’t think I could comment on exactly who did what.” At the time of the investment, which was championed by Dominic Cummings, a senior civil servant and the UK’s Space Agency questioned whether it represented value for money for the British taxpayer. OneWeb has another potential way to gain an advantage over Starlink. It could be used as a kind of redundancy system to GPS, which is made up of 24 satellites 12,000 miles up. OneWeb’s system could be used as a position, navigation and timing [PNT] system to prevent jamming or to step in if GPS went down, an issue that is feared would cost the UK £1bn per day. “This capability is not a target of SpaceX, and represents both a strategic and financial opportunity that could be sizeable,” Henry says. OneWeb is hoping to have its system fully operational by the middle of next year. It still has to raise about another $1bn to achieve this. It plans to scale up its business to around 480 people this year, almost the same number it had pre-bankruptcy, with 70pc in the UK.  In the race against a man as ambitious as Musk, there is no doubt it needs to make up for lost time."

Taxpayer-backed SNP deal which promised 2,000 jobs delivers fewer than 50
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/24/taxpayer-backed-snp-deal-promised-2000-jobs-delivers-fewer-50/,"Fewer than 50 of a promised 2,000 new jobs have been created as a result of a taxpayer-backed takeover of the UK’s last aluminium smelter, a senior SNP minister has admitted. Fergus Ewing, the SNP rural economy secretary, said the 44 additional people had been hired since the Scottish Government agreed to provide a 25-year financial guarantee,  that allowed steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta to take over an industrial site in Fort William, in 2016. Then, it was claimed that the investment would create 1,000 direct jobs and a further 1,000 indirect jobs, while adding £1 billion to the local economy, within a decade. However, Mr Gupta’s GFG Alliance is now facing a funding crisis,   Mr Ewing delivered a statement to Holyrood on Wednesday to address fears that Mr Gupta’s empire, which also includes the Dalzell steel plant in Motherwell, is now on the brink of collapse. Mr Ewing told MSPs that Mr Gupta had personally assured him last week of the “underlying operational health” of his Scottish assets despite acknowledging “challenges” caused by the collapse of Greensill.  Defending the Government’s   in a deal which also included nearby hydro plans used to power it and a large Lochaber estate, he said the alternative would have been to see the facility close. However, Willie Rennie, the Scottish LibDem leader, challenged Mr Ewing after he said there had been 44 new jobs at the site, taking the overall total to just 200. Mr Rennie said: “The Government told us five years ago that the multiplier and supply chain impacts in Lochaber would be worth 2,000 jobs. Are we ever going to see those jobs, and what discussions did he have with Mr Gupta about creating those jobs?” Mr Ewing replied that the jobs that had been created were “valuable” but admitted the firm’s original plans for building an alloy wheels plant “could not proceed” due to problems in the British car industry. He added: “That’s simply a fact that nobody anticipated in 2016, not Mr Rennie, not Mr me [sic], or anybody else. “However, the company have come forward with an amended plan which includes a billets plant and a [water] canning plant. There’s challenges ahead, but we are working extremely hard with everybody to achieve delivery of these objectives.” The deal the Scottish Government agreed with Mr Gupta in 2016 saw it agree to a 25-year guarantee to buy energy from the Lochaber hydro plants, should the smelter shut down, worth between £14m and £32m per year. "

ITV teams up with venture capital as it battles the streaming giants
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/28/itv-teams-venture-capital-battles-streaming-giants/,"After enduring a brutal pandemic, Carolyn McCall will be praying that this year’s hopes for a summer of love come true. The   is betting on a sharp revival in the advertising market as Britain’s world-leading vaccine rollout takes effect - and relying on hits such as reality show   to tap into post-pandemic optimism. Advertising sales, which tumbled by £191m to £1.6bn last year, are poised to jump by up to 75pc next month as millions more jabs go in arms. But this growth may simply be masking a longer-term challenge as television fights for its future in an  . There are fears that the accelerated shift to digital during the pandemic may have forced TV advertisers into the hands of tech platforms. While some will flock back, others may never return. McCall is not taking such threats lying down. The 59-year-old former chief executive of EasyJet has unfurled a plan to help burnish ITV’s financial performance while nurturing a new generation of TV advertisers. ITV has launched ‘AdVentures Invest’, a media-for-equity fund where the broadcaster doles out TV advertising space in exchange for stakes in promising start-ups. The benefits are two-fold. If ITV backs the right company, it has the potential to make a hefty financial return that will support its own migration to streaming. Secondly, ITV can extol the virtues of the broadcasting world with a new breed of advertisers which may be   with the company’s ad platforms but overlooked the huge reach of TV. ITV plans to team up with venture capital funds to take up to 10 positions in companies over the next two years. Each offer will be worth more than £1m from a £15m pot set aside for the first 12 months. ITV has hired Niko Waesche to lead the charge, a venture capitalist who co-founded Germany’s leading media-for-equity fund German Media Pool. But can such modest media investments really compete in London’s fiercely competitive start-up scene that is flooded with venture capital and private equity funding? Even if they can, there is a risk ITV becomes lumbered with a string of companies that struggle to live up to their hype. Waesche is undaunted by the prospect. “Our programme is not to prove that TV works [...] it is about providing an option into the market that is superior to buying advertising with cash. The reason is because we have skin in the game,” he says. “That company knows we will provide our best people who have great insights into brand building and media strategy to help them be successful with a TV campaign. “We are primarily focused on the financial returns, but I think we can learn as much from the failures as we can from the successes of the companies we invest in.” In many ways, ITV is late to the party. Germany’s free-to-air broadcaster ProSieben has made a string of bets in digital companies through its media investment arm, SevenVentures. It was an early backer of Zalando, a German online fashion retailer that has grown into a tech juggernaut with a €22bn (£19bn) market value. UK media companies have also followed suit. Channel 4 Ventures - the broadcaster’s media-for-equity fund - has invested in the social media platform Pinterest and plant-based food business The Meatless Farm.  owner DMGT allows start-ups to target readers of the MailOnline or the   using such a model through its investment arm DMG Ventures. On Thursday, ITV announced its first investment when it took a £3m stake in  , a London-based digital mapping firm that has carved up the planet into 3m squares carrying three words to identify them. The platform, which has also attracted investment from Channel 4, claims to be a more efficient way of tracking locations than using a standard street address. It is an important marker for ITV, but the broadcaster may not always be able to have its own way in a start-up scene market awash with funding options. By zeroing in on consumer-focused firms, Waesche believes his company can hold its own. “We have to try and make our fund as pro-entrepreneurial as possible,” he adds. “That means we cannot be viewed as his big clunky corporate, but somebody that can make quick decisions and is used to the venture capital process. “ITV must be a highly-compatible and lean co-investor. We have spoken to the leading venture capital funds in the UK and we will expect them to be the lead in a transaction. “We are telling the VC’s ‘if you want to have a strong television partner at your side then we are there for you, but we are not going to be very difficult to deal with’. “Please invite us in and we promise to add value.” Berenberg analyst Sarah Simon says ITV’s funds will be offering an attractive proposition to budding entrepreneurs, but questions whether they can be as successful as Prosieben. Tom Harrington of Enders Analysis says ITV could get a double benefit, with “a gainful return on an exit like Pinterest for Channel 4” and advertising sales that have the potential to be “many times over the initial investment”. Waesche expects to hold each investment for up to five years before weighing a sale to another venture capital fund. By then, McCall will have hoped to have made some healthy returns to help cushion ITV’s transition to a purely digital world - starting with a bumper summer."

Independence risks economic havoc for Scots
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/28/independence-risks-economic-havoc-scots/,"Until the early 18th century, crossing the border between Scotland and England meant entering a lawless territory plagued by raiders, livestock rustlers and an assortment of other ne’er do wells – who, in the phrasing of William Wordsworth, would “prey alike on two distracted countries”. Small forts, walled homesteads and pele towers still litter the landscape with reminders of that blood-soaked age. Thankfully, after more than three hundred years of political union, things are a lot simpler: travellers are more likely to be greeted by a Saltire sign reading   (welcome to Scotland) – or, coming the other way, the signs of the Northumberland or Cumbria county councils – than a freebooter. But political strife threatens to return. May’s elections could trigger a major push for a  , just seven years after “once in a generation” plebiscite. The SNP is polling around 50pc and is expected to demand a new vote if it wins a  . Yet much has changed since last time. Economically and financially there have been three main shifts: Brexit, a Covid-enforced boom in debt and a global plunge in oil prices. All make the prospect of independence significantly more challenging. The SNP’s long-standing policy, championed by Nicola Surgeon, is for an independent Scotland to  . But analysis suggests taking such a step too quickly could have devastating consequences. Scotland’s economy is hugely open, with imports and exports each equivalent to around 60pc of its GDP. The country trades about three to four times as much with the rest of the UK as it does with the EU. “The received wisdom sometimes in Scotland seems to be that because Brexit is bad, 'Scexit' and reversing leaving the EU would be good economically,” says David Phillips, associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. “I am not sure that is true, certainly in the short to medium-term. “With a reasonably hard version of Brexit there is almost a choice – do you be part of the UK single market or the EU’s single market?” Trade modellers from the London Schools of Economics say seccession would eventually slash income per capita in Scotland by as much as 8.7pc, dwarfing Brexit’s anticipated long-term hit of 2pc. Rejoining the EU would “do little to mitigate the costs of Scottish independence”, according to these experts, shaving the fall only slightly to between 6.3pc and 7.6pc – and only in the long run. In the short term, they say that returning to the EU would be   than remaining in a common market with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The modellers point to a paradox in the economic argument for leaving the UK and joining European bloc. “For an independent Scotland to be better off inside the EU, independence must destroy a sufficiently large share of Scotland’s trade with the rest of the UK that the EU becomes Scotland’s most important trade partner,” they say. “For rejoining the EU to be economically desirable, independence itself must bring substantial economic costs.” Hanwei Huang, one of the report’s authors, says disentangling the Scottish economy would likely prove more complicated than Brexit. “It probably would depend on the future relationship between the UK and the EU,” he says. “For example, if the UK and EU has a closer relationship, probably it is more attractive for them to stay in the UK common market.” The dangers of an immediate re-entrance to the EU show how much the economic case for Scottish independence has weakened since 2014 – even before factors such as the recovery from Covid-19 are taken into account. Covid has given Britain its  . The national debt has surged by more than a third, from just under £1.5 trillion in 2014 to more than £2.1 trillion now. Working out how to split this bill, built up over centuries, will be politically fraught - and economically critical for a newly independent nation trying to win the confidence of international markets. In 2014 the Scottish Government suggested splitting it by “historic contribution” to the finances, arguing that since 1980 oil revenues meant Scotland has chipped in more than the rest of the country. This would result in Caledonia taking around 5pc of the national debt. Westminster argued this was spurious as extra spending also goes north. In addition, the sums change radically depending on the base year - counting only from 1990 to 2014 and Scotland’s share doubles to almost 10pc. That translates to either £105bn or £210bn. An alternative is to split the debt by share of the population. This would give an independent Scotland just over 8pc of the UK’s national debt, or around £170bn. Either way, investors who bought UK bonds will not see some morph into Scottish bonds. Instead, Scotland would pay the interest on the agreed share of the debt then potentially take some on as the bonds mature, depending on the deal. Meanwhile,  . In 2014 prices seemed permanently high, with fevered talk of Brent reaching $200 per barrel: ideal conditions to finance Scottish spending for years to come. But prices tumbled, dragging tax revenues from the North Sea to a small fraction of their old level. Investment has plunged, output is set to fall steadily and 2050 net zero emissions targets mean the energy source is out of favour altogether. A 2018 report from the Sustainable Growth Commission, established by the SNP, acknowledged the shift and suggested an independent Scotland should treat future oil and gas revenues as “windfalls” rather than a reliable basis for day to day budget planning. As things stand now, that day to day budget would be seriously in the red. Before the pandemic, Scottish tax revenues per capita were a touch lower than those in the UK as a whole, while spending was higher. Mairi Spowage at the University of Strathclyde’s Fraser of Allander Institute notes that this extra spend – some of it set by Westminster, but some, particularly on education and healthcare, decided in Holyrood – means Scotland typically runs a notional budget deficit around six percentage points bigger than the UK’s. In 2019-20 this came in at 8.6pc versus the UK’s 2.6pc. “They tell us little about the long-term sustainability of the public finances of an independent Scotland, because presumably there would be different choices made, different priorities and perhaps things that they would choose not to spend money on as well,” she says. As the Scottish Government puts it: “The whole point of independence is to give the Scottish Parliament all the economic levers it needs to grow our economy and to make the public spending choices best suited to Scotland’s interests – such as not spending hundreds of billions of pounds on the  .” Yet even trimming defence and UK-wide project spending would only cover around one-tenth of the deficit, according to Phillips. Financial markets might be willing to lend big sums at small interest rates through Covid, but they are unlikely to fund large deficits year in, year out. “At the moment, in effect, Scotland is able to slightly live beyond its means because of the fiscal transfers from the rest of the UK,” says Phillips. “Scotland could be a successful independent country, but it would have to fund its own public spending, rather than have some of it implicitly funded by transfers from the rest of the UK. “That would require some combination of tax rises, austerity and borrowing in the first decade at least of an independent Scotland.”"
,business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/27/englands-giant-subsidy-scotland-just-sturgeons-nats-like/,"Why all the fuss about  , now again the subject of fierce debate north of the border as we approach May’s Holyrood elections? Is not Scotland already essentially an independent nation; to finally cut the Gordian knot is only to formally recognise a pre-existing disposition. It might also save the rest of the UK a great deal of money. That’s too flippant a way of looking at things, no doubt, but the Scottish government certainly behaves as if it is running an entirely independent country, an impression further underpinned by the pandemic, where Scotland maintains a largely independent containment policy. Call it devolution if you like, but from the outside, it looks like much more. Across multiple fronts, public policy is now so completely divergent from the rest of the UK that Scotland might as well be fully sovereign. So divergent, in fact, that you begin to wonder whether it is not the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, rather than Boris Johnson, who these days calls the shots for the union as a whole. Her offer of a  , snuck out on the very eve of pre-election purdah - a vote buying initiative if ever there was one - has had the real Prime Minister down in Westminster scurrying off shamefacedly to reconsider his stingy  . How is it, you may well ask,  , but unaffordable down south, which to the extent that anywhere in the UK these days generates a fiscal surplus is where it tends to occur? It’s called the Barnett formula, after the former Labour chief secretary to the Treasury, Joe Barnett, and it works like this. Every year, the budget of the devolved administrations is set by taking the previous year’s spending and adding a pro rata share of whatever increase there has been for the UK as a whole. Last financial year, the Barnett block grant to Scotland amounted to £32bn. The effect is that historic differences in spending are preserved in aspic regardless of whether any longer justified. A further distortion arises because Scotland’s population has been shrinking relative to England’s, which boosts nominal spending per head over time - such that it is today more than 20pc higher than England. As it is, the only parts of the UK that in normal times generate a fiscal surplus - in the sense that they raise more in tax than they spend - are London, the South East and East England. Everywhere else spends more than they raise in tax. For Scotland, the shortfall in 2019 was £2,482 per head. Actually, this is not particularly high by the standards of some UK regions. For instance, the North East spends £4,064 per head more than it raises in tax, according to the latest ONS data. But here’s the point. Scotland is by no means a poor part of the UK; actually, average earnings are roughly the same as the UK as a whole. It follows that Scotland’s per capita contribution to tax revenues is also roughly the same. Scotland’s slightly higher top rates of income tax make only a marginal difference. Revenues from North Sea oil have also ceased to offer much by way of the offset once claimed for them by Scottish separatists. In any case, if you want to know why Scotland can “afford” free higher education, free social care, free prescriptions, a 4pc pay rise for healthcare workers, and all the rest, but England can’t, ask the late Joe Barnett. It is also why the Scottish National Party opposes anything by way of meaningful reform. They know a good thing when they see one. Despite the distortions, they will not be backing the “needs based” system sometimes proposed by way of a fairer alternative. The UK Government also guaranteed continuation of the Barnett formula when campaigning against Scottish independence in the 2014 referendum. We tamper with it at the union’s peril. Indeed, the only way it could plausibly be changed is ironically via a vote for independence in the second referendum Sturgeon threatens to demand should she win an overall majority in the  . Personally, I doubt those ambitions have been as badly damaged by   over who knew what and when as imagined, even with the split in the nationalist vote threatened by Salmond’s new political party. All the same, for Boris Johnson the spat is like a gift from the gods, confirming his reputation as the luckiest of generals. Brexit seemed to doom him to the ignominy of being the Tory Prime Minister who took us out of Europe’s common market only to lose the union.  Exquisitely, the sight of the Scottish National Party tearing itself limb from limb over a matter that nobody could quite understand beyond the evident visceral hatred the participants have for one another, like clansmen fighting in a field, seems to have come to his rescue. Unwise to bet on it quite yet, though. The emotional pull of independence remains a mighty powerful one. This despite the fact that far from easing since the last referendum, the economic challenges of actually implementing a fully independent Scotland have steepened yet further, such that they today seem almost insurmountable. The question of who pays refuses to go away. Given the EU’s almost existential difficulties right now, Europe is not going to be exactly rushing to fill the vacuum in Scotland’s finances left by removal of the English teet. Some part of the shortfall could be met by cancelling Scotland’s share of UK defence spending, yet that would only further undermine the economy by rendering the country’s role as a major UK defence contractor and home to Britain’s independent nuclear deterrent obsolete. Even if Scotland is forgiven its share of Britain’s national debt - a degree of magnanimous generosity rarely seen before when countries go their separate ways (though interestingly, it is what eventually happened in the case of the Republic of Ireland) - massive tax hikes and spending cuts would be required to put Scotland’s public finances on a sustainable footing. For a country that still feels badly wronged by years of Tory austerity, that’s quite an ask. A plausible answer over what to do about the currency has also yet been proposed. Sterlingisation is no kind of a solution; just think what would have happened to Scotland with no lender of last resort to bankroll the emergency expenditure that has been required by Covid. On its own account, Holyrood would have found credit impossible to access. The fact is that the unsatisfactory nature of today’s settlement suits Sturgeon’s Scottish nationalists rather better than they care to admit, sustained in power as they are by the largesse of the Barnett formula and the unfulfilled dream of independence. The challenges of the real thing would very likely finish them off."
,business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/31/city-starting-give-eu/,"Okay, let’s not get carried away. The news that the UK and Brussels are   is, of course, to be welcomed. But it’s probably a touch early to break out the bunting and start organising street parties.  The two sides have finalised the contents of a   that should lead to the creation of a “joint UK-EU financial regulatory forum”. That’s even less exciting than it sounds. It’s not so much a deal, more the establishment of a new talking shop.  Whatever your view of Brexit, there can be little debate that the best trade agreement for the City of London was the one that it had before the UK voted to leave the European Union: full access to the single market and an outsized say in the shaping of its financial regulations. As of now, there are certain services that UK-based firms are simply not allowed to provide European clients.  The new “deal” is therefore a bit like suspending all the Eurostar, Eurotunnel and ferry services between the UK and the continent and then laying on a few replacement pedalos. Actually, that’s not quite right. It’s more like agreeing a quorum to timetable future discussions on the feasibility of introducing pedalos at an as yet unspecified date. This is the point we have reached. Since the referendum, expectations about the kind of deal the Government would be able to secure for the financial industry have gradually dwindled to almost nothing. The City has at least become inured to disappointment: it expected little from the Christmas Eve Brexit deal and got even less.  Most firms were ready. They started preparing for a hard Brexit as soon as they heard the referendum result in 2016. As the head of the European operations of a US investment bank said to me: “I was upset by Brexit when it was going to cost me a lot of money. But now that I've spent it, I don’t really care.” Indeed there are a growing number of voices in the financial industry suggesting that the UK probably shouldn’t even bother   - the last great hope for the City’s future relationship with the bloc. That’s because, whisper it quietly, equivalence is pretty rubbish too.  For starters, it is not, as is sometimes assumed, a single catchall solution. Equivalence, where firms are granted access to a market because the regulatory regime in their country is considered comparable, applies in about 40 different areas, each of which would potentially have to be separately negotiated and agreed. The EU has, for example, already granted equivalence in clearing for 18 months. The UK will probably be able to push for equivalence in less contentious areas like data uniformity and insurance. It would be nice to get it for equities and derivatives trading venues. But don’t hold your breath on that one.  What’s worse, in asking for equivalence, the UK would effectively be signing up to EU financial rules without having any say in shaping them. That’s fine right now as the UK and EU regulatory regimes are basically identical. But it would prevent the UK from diverging in any meaningful way over time, thus undermining one of the stated rationales for Brexit. Indeed, the EU has already demanded the UK map out its future regulatory plans as a prerequisite to any possible agreement. However, the single biggest problem with equivalence is that it is granted unilaterally. It is not a deal; it is the EU’s gift. And what Brussels giveth, Brussels can most certainly taketh away. Why on earth would the UK agree to having a sword hung over its most important industry?  All of which is why Philip Hammond, when Chancellor, described a third-country equivalence regime as “wholly inadequate” for the scale and complexity of UK-EU financial services trade. He argued it was “never meant to carry such a load”. He was right. It could be argued that equivalence is better than nothing. And it has certainly been used by other “third countries”. The US, for example, has cleared euro-denominated derivative trades on such a basis for years.  But that arrangement works because it so clearly benefits both sides. The relationship between the UK and the EU is manifestly more antagonistic and will likely remain so for years to come. The Bank of England this week raised concerns that European regulators are asking financial firms to relocate more jobs and operations to the continent than are strictly necessary from a prudential perspective. Trust is in pretty short supply right now.  What's more, the EU has reportedly said it is in ""no hurry"" to grant equivalence. The longer the UK spends on a doomed mission, the less time it will have to focus on other opportunities.  Over the past 15 years, the EU’s share of global financial activity has shrunk by a third and been overtaken by Asia in almost every sector, according to New Financial. The think tank has forecast Asia’s share of global finance will rise from 30pc in 2018 to 54pc in 2040. This is one area where the City should be looking for new customers.  The UK, along with the US, specialises in the kind of cross-border financial business that might most appeal to them. The two countries account for about 70pc of all global derivatives trading, for example. This is one area where the City should be looking to help shape global financial standards.  Hammond pooh-poohed equivalence because he was angling for a closer relationship along the lines of “mutual recognition”, whereby the UK and EU would jointly determine their rules were robust enough to allow two-way access. That hope proved forlorn.  But equivalence also prevents a closer relationship with other markets. It would place the City in a kind of regulatory limbo - neither in nor out of the single market.  If that's all there is on offer, then it’s looking increasingly like any form of financial services deal between the UK and the EU - beyond a regular catch up and chat - is a complete non-starter.  Time to move on."

Why London’s transport crisis will not stay underground
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/04/londons-transport-crisis-will-not-stay-underground/,"Sadiq Khan barely had time to rearrange his office on the banks of the River Thames before taking a swipe at Boris Johnson’s approach to industrial relations during his eight years as London mayor. “Unlike my predecessor, I promise to maintain a constructive dialogue with the trade unions in order to keep London’s transport network moving,” he said, just three weeks after taking office. Invoking the legacy of Ken Livingstone, Khan continued: “There were more than twice as many strikes on the London Underground under my predecessor than there was under the previous mayor.” Three trade unions represent the vast majority of London Underground’s 16,500 staff. Over the years, the RMT, ASLEF and TSSA have enjoyed considerable bargaining clout with the knowledge that they effectively had the power to bring the capital to a standstill. “You have to give it to them because they did a fantastic job during the years for their members,” says Mike Brown, who led Transport for London between 2015 and 2020. “Whichever mayor has been in charge, whether it is the current one, his predecessor, or the first one; none of them really wanted a Tube strike.” Professor Tony Travers from London School Economics adds: “There is no question that Tube unions have exerted extraordinary power by a mixture of strikes [and] threats of strikes. “They have had enormous leverage over the city and over successive mayors because of the damage they can inflict on the city’s economy. “They use that power very effectively, even more effectively than on the national railway, where it is easier to substitute a car for the journey. This means they have over years managed to deliver for their members extraordinarily good pay and benefits.” The average basic annual salary of an Underground driver is £56,496, Transport for London disclosed in a Freedom of Information request last November. This compares with the average London worker’s pay of £33,280, according to the Office for National Statistics. Most Underground staff are entitled to a reported 43 days of holiday a year and work 36-hour weeks, TfL said. Those willing to work overtime can have their pay topped up to more than £100,000, another disclosure revealed. Moody’s, a ratings agency that reviews the financial strength of TfL, last week estimated that demand for public transport across the capital will never return to pre-pandemic levels as commuters embrace working from home or changing their travel habits. With Khan under pressure to cut his cloth accordingly, he will be under pressure to reduce service levels and cut jobs. One former senior executive at London Underground agrees. “I think now there is probably capacity in London beyond what is needed. The premise was always, in terms of capacity for the London Underground, [there will be] exponential growth in demand. Everybody said that the city will continue to grow. But is that still the case?” The prospect of a permanent fall in passenger numbers as a result of the pandemic comes as a fresh headache for Khan, TfL’s chairman. He is already grappling with a gaping hole in the transport authority’s finances and appealing to his predecessor, who these days occupies No 10 Downing Street,  . What impact a permanent reduction will have on the balance of power between the unions and the authorities is a matter of debate. “I do think the dynamic has definitely shifted,” says Brown. “Because society has proved that 90pc of people can work from home for a given day. “And if you end up with the potential for legislation that demands the sort of minimum service provision for essential workers, which has been mooted by the Government; then actually, you can see how a city could operate in a combination of Zoom calls and a few essential workers going to and from work.” Travers says: “Through the pandemic, and even to now, the leverage that came with being able to disrupt so many people’s daily journey to work and so many businesses has been reduced to virtually zero.” Finn Brennan from ASLEF disagrees: “It’s ABC to every experienced negotiator, that you don’t try to take short-term advantage in a long-term relationship. “If there was an attempt by management, by the Government, to use the pandemic as an excuse to attack a group of workers who’ve kept London moving right through the pandemic, that will leave a huge legacy of bitterness.” It is almost nine years to the day since Johnson promised to tackle “hardline union barons” during his successful mayoral campaign for a second term with a pledge to install driverless trains by 2022. Brown remembers things differently during the final year that Johnson’s tenure crossed over with his. “It’s amazing that he [Johnson] is passionate for a driverless Underground, because he certainly wasn’t when he was the mayor,” he says. As Prime Minister, Johnson’s fascination with driverless trains has been reignited. Last July he said that giving driverless trains the green light  . Conveniently for the unions, a TfL report leaked a few weeks later concluded that removing all drivers from the Underground was “not economically feasible”. Supporters of driverless trains highlight that many of London’s services are already set up to run without a driver. They also draw comparisons with the Paris Metro which operates driverless services as well as Docklands Light Railway that serves east London, which has been automated since its launch in 1987. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, is up for the fight if Johnson’s administration makes driverless trains a condition of long-term financial support. “It is a shame that this Government wants to have a class war against working people,” he says. Brown says: “I lived through 7/7 and I visited the Piccadilly line train just after the bomb – it was the most horrific thing I’ve ever done. You certainly would need a member of staff on every train. So you have got to work out how much marginal cost you would really save.” He adds that “single bore” tunnels that much of the Underground runs through means that evacuating carriages is difficult. Travers says: “It’s not impossible, but it’s not that quick, and it’s not cheap. The Government is already having to spend billions a year on bailing out TfL and the national railway. I doubt that the Department for Transport or the Treasury want to spend even more, particularly when they don’t know what the system is going to look like in three, five or 10 years’ time.” Back in City Hall, Khan’s staff are enjoying what some refer to as a “truce” with Tube unions during the pandemic. Union leaders know that the threat of industrial action – and onlookers point out that over the years threats rarely materialise into walkouts – would not look good. Khan has at least delivered his May 2016 promise in cosying up to the trade unions, according to Brennan and Cash. “I do think there has been a much more constructive relationship,” Brennan says. “There has been much more of a culture of ‘let’s try and resolve problems’. It doesn’t mean all the problems have gone away, because there are deep-seated industrial relations issues. But certainly progress has been made. There’s no doubt about that.” Cash claims Johnson refused to meet the RMT, a union that was once expelled from the Labour Party over militant tactics. “I’d have more chance of meeting Boris Karloff than Boris Johnson,” he says."
,business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/01/sanjeev-gupta-must-joking-future-metals-empire-far-rosy/,"Business and April Fool's jokes tend not to mix, as Volkswagen reminded everyone this week with a poorly executed gag about a name change. Its American operations would be called Voltswagen, it said, a nod to an electrical future. Get it?  Except someone forgot to remind the pranksters that the whole point of an April Fool's joke is that it is supposed to coincide with April Fool's Day, otherwise the joke is on you, and VW made the announcement a whole three days before.  Still, at least the carmaker was right about one thing: the idea that a company that will forever be remembered for   could be taken seriously when it comes to electric vehicles is certainly funny. Maybe the Germans have a sense of humour after all. So, it was good of Sanjeev Gupta to try to even things out by pretending he would explain on national radio what the future held for his   now that its chief lender Greensill Capital has gone under.  Greensill’s demise has serious implications for his sprawling metals empire and 5,000 UK jobs, most of them in the steel industry, at plants in Rotherham, Hartlepool, Motherwell and many other provincial towns. But anyone hoping for real answers from a man whose business has been an enthusiastic recipient of state support would have come away from his   disappointed. Even on the subject of how much Greensill had lent to his company GFG, Gupta said he wasn’t prepared to go into the details, other than to say it was in the “billions”.  Yet we already know from GFG’s own court testimony when Greensill crashed into administration in February that it had accumulated debts of $5bn with the firm, equivalent to the vast majority of the company’s total borrowings, it is thought. So why the reluctance to give even the most basic of financial figures?  And if  , how much longer can GFG survive? Greensill’s investors want their money back but Gupta reckons he doesn’t have to repay his loans for another three years. That sounds like wishful thinking but ultimately either a court or administrators at Grant Thornton will decide. Besides, the business has received a ""huge amount of interest from new financiers willing to back us"", he said. Yet, with much of Gupta’s business interests pledged as collateral against the money it borrowed from Greensill, unearthing new lenders will be a challenge. He also said that GFG was ""not waiting for anybody"" and those in charge were ""doing what we can to help our businesses"", so which is it? Either it needs alternative sources of financing, or it doesn’t. The idea that the company’s emergency ""Project Athena"" plan, which requires every steel plant it owns to produce daily reports on how they are conserving cash, might guarantee survival seems fanciful at best.  On the contrary, it’s merely an indication of how stretched the business is that it has been reduced to balancing the books on a day-to-day basis. A request for a £170m government loan has been turned down, a plea that Gupta tried to pass off as evidence that it was diligently exploring all avenues for new financing rather than proof that it was rapidly running out of options. To anyone listening in Scunthorpe or Stocksbridge, or any of the other towns where Gupta is a major employer, it probably sounded like there was no crisis, that this was nothing more than another bump on what he described as “a tough journey”.  Gupta even promised that none of its plants will shut ""under my watch"". But who’s he trying to kid? With several winding-up petitions lodged against some of his UK companies, it may not be for him to decide.  Perhaps it’s Spring and the lighter evenings, though more likely it’s the gradual easing of lockdown, but there’s suddenly a sense of optimism in the air. First it was  , fresh from reporting an 80pc drop in turnover after its pubs were closed for three quarters of the last year.  Rather than drowning his sorrows, Emeny chose instead to raise a glass to customers ""eager to return to pubs"" with a £54m fund-raising that will help to train extra staff needed to cope when the punters return. Now, it’s Next chief Simon Wolfson who is feeling bullish. Despite a halving of profits last year,   for the coming year after a bigger-than-expected boom in online sales.  Recent trading has convinced his Lordship of several things: first that the huge shift to online shopping has not only accelerated but is here to stay; and secondly that the outlook is rosier than many anticipated. Wolfson thinks a combination of “pent-up demand” and “a healthy overall increase in personal savings” would make the “consumer economy” as he calls, “healthier than many presume”. Next was an early-mover in online shopping, invested heavily in its website, logistics, and more recently, third party brands, so Wolfson has more reason than most to be confident about the recovery. Nevertheless, for one of Britain’s most respected bosses to sound so upbeat is hugely reassuring."

Questor: Entain doesn’t need a bid to bring out its value – quite the opposite. Keep buying
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/shares/questor-entain-doesnt-need-bid-bring-value-quite-opposite/,"“This business looks mispriced on every measure,” we said of Entain, the former GVC and the owner of Ladbrokes, when we tipped it at £10.90 a share  . It didn’t take long to discover that we weren’t the only ones to think that way. In early January it received a bid from an American firm. That offer had pushed its share price up to £14.03 by the time we  . Entain, rightly in this column’s view,   as inadequate and the bidder walked away. The shares fell back to about £12.50 but it wasn’t long before they began to climb again. Investors are waking up to the fact that Britain’s gaming companies have a lot to offer their American rivals. For proof, just look at the takeover offer made for  , the gaming services firm once called JackpotJoy, late last month by New York-listed Bally’s. Shares in William Hill, meanwhile, will shortly be delisted following a successful bid from yet another American company, Caesars, last autumn. No doubt the cheapness of London-listed companies relative to those that trade on other markets worldwide is some of the attraction, as is an exchange rate that remains favourable to foreign buyers even after the pound’s recent run. But there is something more specific that Britain’s gaming companies can offer to their American counterparts – something that they might struggle to find elsewhere. It’s an accident of history that gaming expertise and technology are found on this side of the Atlantic rather than the other. Until recently betting on sports and on games such as roulette, in person or online, was banned in the US except, famously, in one or two places such as Las Vegas. The laws have now been relaxed and, state by state, the country is opening up to gambling. But British firms have had a huge head start when it comes to developing the technology needed for online gaming. America though is a far larger country so the opportunity is likewise greater. US companies are desperate to seize that opportunity but they need the right technology. Speed is of the essence so it makes more sense to buy it than to try to develop it from scratch. This brings us back to Entain. The firm has “arguably the best gaming technology in the world”, James Thorne, a UK fund manager at Columbia Threadneedle, told Questor in December. This is why Entain was right to reject the none-too-generous offer it received in January. That offer came from MGM Resorts International, which owns hotels in Las Vegas among other assets and is Entain’s partner in a 50:50 joint venture in America. It is therefore the obvious buyer for the British company. Normally you would it expect it to come back with a better offer for such a valuable, unique asset but it is only itself a little bigger than Entain and “probably can’t afford to pay what Entain is worth”, said Mr Thorne. The joint venture between MGM and Entain would complicate a purchase by another American firm but fortunately we don’t need to rely on a bid to realise Entain’s full value – quite the opposite in fact. The company has proved its ability to expand by making acquisitions that it then moves over to its own technology. This gives it huge opportunities even beyond the vast one that exists in America. “It has said there are 100 markets it could ultimately operate in, versus the 21 it is in now,” Mr Thorne said. “Latin America, for example, has very good dynamics for gambling, not least widespread enthusiasm for sports betting, and it could be as big a market as the US. Meanwhile recent trading updates show that the joint venture in America is picking up very large market shares in the states that have opened up.” He added: “The worst outcome for investors would potentially be if Entain got taken over in the next few months – a bid wouldn’t reflect the full value this business is in a position to create over the next four years or so.” The final piece in the jigsaw is that Entain’s new chief executive, Jette Nygaard-Andersen, who took over in late January, seems fully up to the task. “She is deeply impressive,” Mr Thorne said. Entain remains undervalued. Keep buying.  "

,business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/01/legal-sword-damocles-hangs-europes-vast-bond-market/,"The German constitutional court has struck again. The fund that was supposed to save Europe is in suspended animation.  If the European project ever unravels it will probably because of a ruling by the venerable  . Each time its interventions become a greater threat. You can stretch the EU treaties and Germany’s Basic Law only so far. The normal etiquette is for the judges to issue polite requests to the German president whenever required. This time they time issued an order. Their hackles are up. The court was irritated by attempts to rush through German assent for  , an instrument that allows the European Commission to raise serious money for the first time on the capital markets. It gives Brussels a giant slush fund to play with, and it changes the constitutional order. The judges told him to withhold assent for the financing mechanism until they have reviewed a complaint by Germany’s tireless eurosceptic professors. The case could take months, possibly years. The final ruling may kill off plans to create federalist eurobonds by the back door.  It may also thwart efforts to turn the fund into a permanent EU ‘fiscal entity’, the disarming term for smuggling through an economic union, with pooled debts and a European treasury. It would eviscerate the Bundestag and national parliaments without having to put the matter to national referenda.   If the court finds in favour of plaintiffs, Southern Europe  . One can no longer rule out debt restructuring of systemic scale, either conducted in an orderly fashion within the euro, or in a disorderly fashion that breaks the euro,  .  The former would require more foresight and statecraft than Ursula von der Leyen has shown so far. Her reflex would be to prohibit investors from selling their bonds in self-protection. She would try to blame it all on “speculators”. Professor Bernd Lucke, the key litigant in the new case, told me Europe’s politicians are exploiting the pandemic to push through the next leap forward in the Project. “They are abusing the crisis to reshape the EU into a transfer union. Once they open that door, nobody will ever be able to close it,” he said. The   set off a minor earthquake last May when it ruled that the European Central Bank  , beyond its treaty powers. The ECB was no longer conducting monetary policy. It was engaging in disguised fiscal rescues under the cloak of QE bond purchases. This left German citizens on the hook for liabilities of unknown size without the democratic assent of the German parliament. The row was defused with a fudge. But the judicial warning could not be ignored. The court has constrained the ECB in critical ways. A perennial bailout is no longer possible. Markets are betting that the new case will be fudged as well. They assume that the judges will wink at creeping fiscal federalism, after some faux protest. That may happen. But this case enters more dangerous legal waters for the EU project.  “You can’t extrapolate anything from previous cases. Those were about monetary policy and the ECB, which is designed to be an independent institution. That is completely different from fiscal policy,” said Prof Lucke.  “It is a core principle of our constitution ( ) that fiscal policy stays under the control of the German parliament,” he said. Legislative power over tax and spending is the lifeblood of democracies. It was an attempt to circumvent Parliament that led to the English Civil War, a point made by Otmar Issing, the ECB’s founding chief economist. He has since turned against monetary union, calling it a “house of cards”. Prof Lucke's case invokes Article 311 of the Treaties. It states that the EU’s policy objectives “shall be financed wholly from own resources”. Under normal practice, each member state is liable only for its share of debt issuance when backing EU schemes. The Recovery Fund entails unlimited liability. If one EU state defaults on its share of the debt, the remaining members have to pick up the tab. You can easily imagine a domino effect  .  “What really worries me is if a country leaves the EU. It would no longer be legally liable for Union debt,” said Prof Lucke. Europe’s leaders have unwittingly created a device to explode their own project.  They have raised the incentive for countries to leave in future episodes of stress, with a first-mover advantage. These states would not be in the same position as the UK under Article 50: facing an inflated divorce bill set by Brussels. “Their negotiating position would be stronger,” he said. Veteran litigants are split on the likely outcome of this case. “The German elites will never give up the mad project of the euro. They will defend it like the Eastern Front,” said Gunnar Beck, an EU law professor and an MEP from the   party.   Prof Beck said the court is as ideologically besotted with EU federalism as the rest of the German establishment. “The judges are very political and they will just ignore the law as always,” he said. Political risk group   thinks the court will let the Recovery Fund go ahead but will constrain its reach and prevent it from becoming permanent. If so, this has consequences. We can debate the theoretical limits to sovereign debt in a currency union, where exchange rate risk is converted into default risk. What is clear is that the shock of Covid-19, on top of Europe’s lost decade,  . The Commission expects debt to peak at 122pc of GDP in Spain, 127pc in Portugal, 159pc in Italy, and 194pc in Greece, but that was before the Covid third wave wrecked the second quarter and threatened the summer season.  Italy’s low growth trend makes it nigh impossible to bring such a debt ratio back under control, and when Italy goes, so do others. The ECB is for now soaking up the debt and masking the problem. That becomes harder to justify once inflation picks up, even stretching the definition of monetary policy. The next line of defence is the Recovery Fund, and market assumptions that it will be expanded over time, morphing into a debt union. As long as that belief holds, debt ratios hardly matter. The German credit card will take care of all.  Markets know the fund is supposed to be temporary, a one-off emergency to cover the pandemic. It must be wound down later. Europe’s constitutional structure must return to the  , meaning a treaty club of sovereign states responsible for their own debts rather than a proto-federal state.  Bond investors in Frankfurt, London, New York, and Tokyo do not care. They think the EU will always find some way to finesse the Treaties, whatever the legal text actually says.  None other than German vice-chancellor, Olaf Scholtz, called it Europe’s “Hamilton Moment”. He was evoking American fiscal union in the 1790s - a bailout of bankrupt states by Virginia, the Deutschland of the day. But Mr Scholtz blew the game. A Hamilton Moment tramples all over the German constitution. His words will be thrown back at him.   The   may now be forced to kill off European fiscal union whether the judges like it or not. Bond markets should start brushing up on German law."
,business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/02/get-ready-britains-post-pandemic-boom/,"Less than two months ago, in its last Monetary Policy Committee report, the Bank of England forecast that the UK economy would shrink a further 4 per cent in the first quarter of this year. It looked a reasonable enough prediction, given renewed lockdown of at that stage indeterminate length. At the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, they were more pessimistic still. In early December, the OECD warned that recovery from the pandemic would be slower in the UK than any other major economy bar Argentina, with GDP still 6 per cent smaller by the end of this year than its pre-pandemic level. Fortunately, it is not turning out that way, so much so that it is now entirely plausible that the first quarter of this year could be in positive territory, or only a little down on the preceding three months. In view of where we were, that would be a remarkable outcome. For it wasn’t just another national lockdown the economy has had to contend with; there were also the disruptions of Brexit, which have hammered exports to the Continent.  Even so, the OECD could scarcely have been more wrong.  . Instead, the supposed tortoise has turned into a hare, such that it seems entirely possible the economy will be back to pre-pandemic levels of activity by the late summer, leaving European neighbours trailing in its wake. . Mobility data, together with anecdotal evidence, suggests that even before the restrictions began to be eased, lockdown rules were being widely flouted. Try as the Government has to persuade us that we are not yet out of the woods, rapid vaccine rollout has generated a widespread sense of release. This may be unwarranted, but it is already observable in freer economic behaviour. More importantly, however, the economy has just got a whole lot better at coping with lockdown. Forecasters hugely underestimated our ability to adapt. Forms of economic activity that seemed impossible a year ago now take place with relative ease. It is only really the hospitality, non essential retail, travel and events sectors that continue to be heavily impacted. There has, moreover, been a degree of compensating growth elsewhere in the economy – surging online sales and more home consumption being only the most obvious manifestations. In any case, the narrative has shifted in a way that even a few months ago could not have been predicted. Here are six catchall reasons for confidence in the future. One. Fast declining Covid hospitalisation and death rates make it all but inconceivable that the timetable for lifting lockdown restrictions will not be met. With the possible exception of overseas travel, the economy should be operating normally again by late June, with the removal of all legal limits on social contact. Vaccine resistant variants could puncture this certainty, but for now we have seen no evidence of them. Two. The Chancellor has extended income support from April to September, which greatly mitigates the expected spike in unemployment that would have occurred when furlough came to an end. Astonishingly, given the worst economic downturn in more than 300 years, unemployment looks as if it will peak at little more than 6 per cent. The Government has seemingly done a good job at preventing wider economic scarring. Three. At least some part of the excess in savings built up during more than a year of on/off lockdown will get spent in the years ahead. This will temporarily add rocket boosters to returning levels of demand. Already we see evidence of it in buoyant house sales, holiday bookings and restaurant reservations. Four. Just as the very un-European way in which we measure public sector activity deepened the recorded size of the downturn going into the pandemic, the reverse effect comes into play as we come out. A seemingly bigger contraction is met by a sharper rebound. The vaccine programme adds further welly to public sector output. Five. The inventory cycle – accumulation of stocks followed by their depletion – used to play a big part in the wider ups and downs of the economy, but has been made all but redundant in recent decades by just-in-time supply chains. A combination of Brexit, lockdown and the Suez canal blockage may temporarily have brought it back into play. Inventories have been run down to historic lows, indicating an urgent need to rebuild, which will in turn further boost economic activity. Six. A veritable boom in investment spending can be anticipated over the next two years as businesses seek to take advantage of “super-deductions” announced in the Budget. With firms attempting to beat the higher corporation tax rate in two years’ time, the effect is only to steal investment spending from the future. Yet for a while, the new tax regime promises to turbocharge business investment. Mix it all together, and some kind of mini-boom is in prospect, albeit one coloured by deep structural change, negative as well as positive. Happy Easter."

This electrified classic Mercedes will set you back more than £245,000

The   is launching an electric version of the Mercedes-Benz SL Pagoda - a car first built in the 1960s - following customer requests for certain prestige to be added to the range. The company declined to give a price for the new model, saying only that it will be above the £245,000 it charges for what is currently its cheapest model. The trend for “upcycling”, restoring products in a way that gives them more value, along with a move to zero-emissions transport has delivered a huge boost to Lunaz. As well as being restored to showroom condition, the classic cars Lunaz works on have proprietary electric drive systems installed in place of the existing internal combustion, providing a more reliable drivetrain than the original mechanical workings which can be half a century old. David Lorenz, founder and chief executive, said: “The popularity of electrified classic cars is proof that the pinnacle market is rebalancing its consumption habits. “The growth of Lunaz affirms the UK’s status as a leader in the development of clean-air automotive technologies. We are proud to operate within the principles of the circular economy and show that British industry can provide answers to the global need to transition to less impactful industrial practices.” The company started two years ago restoring and electrifying old Jaguars and Rolls-Royces, but has since added Bentley and Range-Rover to its stable. Lunaz recently moved to a new headquarters and production facility at the Northamptonshire racetrack, announcing plans to more than double its workforce to 100 by the end of the year. Demand is now so strong - first quarter sales are up 300pc on last year - that it is already planning to add more staff and enlarge its premises in 2022. Lunaz is also investigating further applications for its electric power system that could result in them being installed in up cycled trucks and other industrial vehicles. "

Brookfield declined to comment but a source close to the sale said: “We have a lot of conversations with people all the time.” It is understood the whole building will be sold rather than a stake.

City jobs exodus to the Continent is more a ripple than a wave
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/04/city-jobs-exodus-continent-ripple-wave/,"MPs were warned by HSBC’s former chairman Douglas Flint in 2017 that Brexit could trigger a “Jenga tower” of job losses, referring to the game where a whole tower of wooden blocks can topple down just by pulling just one piece out. Xavier Rolet, then chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, told ministers he believed some 232,000 financial services roles were at risk. Their aim was to pressure the Government into prioritising the finance industry during negotiations with Brussels. It did not work. “We took a worst-case scenario, the most severe kind of  , from the outset, which is what we have ended up with,” says an executive from a large US bank. “We didn’t want a worst case scenario but planned for it.” Now that the City’s low expectations on Brexit have been met,  . The UK has been stripped of its passporting rights, which gave full access to EU markets, and a feeling of apathy has swept through the Square Mile. The European head of one US bank says: “I was upset by Brexit when it was going to cost me a lot of money. But now that I’ve spent it, I don’t really care.” Yet there remains one key battle, in which Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, is said to have taken a special interest. How many City jobs really have to move to rival EU hubs due to Brexit? Banking insiders say regulatory officials are asking questions about “how and where banks are booking trades, and why” amid fears an unnecessary number of staff are being pressured to move. On the face of it, Bailey doesn’t have too much to worry about. Flint and Rolet’s doomsday forecasts on job losses are yet to materialise. According to EY, only 7,600 financial services jobs have so far moved out of the UK due to Brexit. That’s a tiny proportion of jobs in the UK’s finance sector. Yet Rolet sticks to his forecast. He still believes that 232,000 roles could go, based on research conducted by EY and commissioned by the LSE, if the UK loses its grip on the lucrative clearing market. The London Stock Exchange Group still dominates clearing, which processes financial products worth hundreds of billions of pounds every day and plays a crucial role for London as a financial centre, but the EU wants to seize control. “I still believe the conclusions [that 232,000 jobs will go] are correct. This is why the EU is fighting so hard to move the clearing of euro-denominated [over-the-counter]OTC derivatives – the largest asset class in the world – back to EU shores,” Rolet argues. “This is far, far bigger and more strategic than the .” The UK only emerged from a four-year legal battle with the European Central Bank over clearing trades in the eurozone in 2015, but Brexit gave politicians including former French president Francois Hollande reasons to restart the debate. Tensions between the UK and Brussels have risen in recent weeks, even though a new talking shop between the two sides was established in late March to  . Bank of England officials are now   before relocating any further UK jobs to the bloc amid fears there have been some excessive requests from the ECB which go beyond what regulations require. It is unlikely that the ECB shares this perspective. Late last year it reiterated that its view on the matter is simple: “EU products and transactions with EU clients involving non-EU products should be booked in the EU. Similarly, risk management capabilities related to EU products should be located in the EU.” That could come at a high price for the UK. Financial services exports are worth £56bn and just over a third go to the EU, according to industry body TheCityUK. Since the Brexit referendum,   almost £1.3 trillion of UK assets to the EU. Aware how much is at stake, EU politicians have been courting City firms for years.   to “choose France” at a lavish soiree at Versailles Palace in 2018. Some London bankers say they are now preparing to move in the coming months. Major lenders including JP Morgan plan to complete all relocations by the end of this year. Some are looking forward to life out of London after over a year of lockdown. One person asked to relocate with his family so that he can continue dealing with EU clients says he was given a choice on which European city to move to and is looking forward to it. The discussions were “intricate rather than blunt”, he says. But despite Macron’s attempts for London bankers to “choose France”, there has been no exodus and now clear winner among the EU finance hubs vying for London’s crown. Those jobs that have moved have been scattered across the Continent and some executives are even choosing to commute to London every weekend. Spots at international schools in Frankfurt  . Officials in Paris who in 2018 promised to create 1,000 extra school places and three new international lycees to attract London bankers have not provided an update since. “I know folks who thought their roles might get relocated but weren’t,” says veteran banker Paul Lynam. The migration to date has also been fractured according to which sector of the City is involved. Luxembourg is popular among insurers and asset managers rather than bankers. Nicolas Mackel, of Luxembourg for Finance, admits that while Brexit has led to an uptick in jobs, “it is not a game changer”. “Our financial industry employs 60,000 people with an annual growth rate of 2pc since 2011. So 2,000 more jobs being created over a couple of years due to Brexit may be an additional growth factor but does not create bottlenecks in schools, housing or traffic, especially given most of these are jobs for which firms have hired locally,” he adds. “The real story is more about jobs created elsewhere than about people moving.” Miles Celic, of industry lobby group TheCityUK, said: “It’s disappointing to see political considerations driving the EU’s approach to financial regulation. The location of markets, jobs and activity should be where customers want them to be, not where politics demands.”"

'Win-win': Airbus aims to expand in Britain post-Brexit
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/03/win-win-airbus-aims-expand-britain-post-brexit/,"Guillaume Faury pauses for a moment before launching into a withering assessment of the   in Europe. “Honestly, it’s a disaster,” says the boss of Airbus, the world’s largest plane-maker. “The situation is really bad. It’s uncoordinated. There’s a lot of constraints moving from one country to the other, not to mention the UK.” Faury took the top job  , having run the company’s dominant passenger jet division since early 2018. He’d got used to jetting off from the Toulouse base to Airbus sites around the world, but is now constrained to Europe.  “I continue to fly, mainly in France but also to Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, but it’s complex,” Faury says, referencing the   necessitated for such trips. Visiting the UK,  , is pretty much out of the question because of what he describes as Britain’s “pretty frightening” quarantine rules.  Coronavirus has hit Airbus hard.   – 15,000 employees – and last year the commercial aircraft arm suffered a 37pc fall in revenues to €34bn (£30bn) and a loss of €1.3bn. Airlines reeling from the pandemic cancelled orders for 115 jets last year, taking net 268 orders for new aircraft – a third of 2019’s level. However, Faury says it is not all bad news. Air travel in China is “robust” and above pre-pandemic levels. India is about a quarter down, and the US is on a “strong trajectory”. But Europe remains a massive problem and he wants something done about it. “We want, we expect, governments to have a coordinated response,” Faury says, calling for measures which are “of the same nature, and more importantly, predictable”. Despite the financial hit – and passenger jet production being cut by 40pc in response – Airbus weathered 2020 “probably as well as we could” he says. Without certainty, this year could be much more difficult, Faury says. “The amount of inefficiencies being put into a system like ours – and it’s not just Airbus I’m describing, but many international businesses – are just unsustainable.” “Last year was about crisis, the brutality of the epidemic. But we had a clear direction and it was reduction,” he says. “2021 is full of ambiguity and contradictions of complexity. We need to find a way between the different situations.”  It seems odd, but Faury has set Airbus on a path to a new age of aerospace even in the depths of the crisis. In September he unveiled designs for   with a pledge to have a zero-emission aircraft in service by 2035. It’s likely to be an expensive and, “ambitious but extremely realistic” plan, according to Faury. Airbus probably doesn’t have a choice. Decarbonisation plans have aviation firmly in their sights. Air travel accounts for 2.5pc of all carbon emissions and less than a tenth of the total from all forms of transport. However, it’s a high-profile target of conspicuous consumption when 80pc of the world’s population do not fly. The Airbus chief sets out a timeline for the plan. “We need five years to mature the technology, but those technologies are not rocket science,” he says, before quickly correcting himself. “Actually some are. We fly them on our rockets and satellites.” He aims to get suppliers on board and launch the programme in earnest in 2027, with paying passengers on board by the middle 2030s. “It’s a lot of work, but credible,” he says, adding guilt-free zero emissions flight is likely to be more expensive because of the technology involved. “But there will also be a price for carbon.” Both Airbus and Boeing are working on aircraft that can fly on biofuels, but Faury has overseen a far more ambitious strategy around decarbonisation than its US rival.  He’s loth to criticise his competitor – despite Airbus having outsold Boeing for several years – calling it an engineering powerhouse. “One should never make the mistake of complacency or thinking others are not tough competitors,” Faury says. “The time will come when they will be very active.” The blow of Boeing’s 737 Max – a direct competitor to the A320 –  , entailing massive upheaval and costs for the US manufacturer, means Airbus was better positioned to weather Covid. But Faury adds coronavirus’s impact was “a hell of a challenge for everyone but we are probably emerging faster”.  He’s not just looking to Airbus’s rival in the decades-old aerospace duopoly as a competitor.   is due to get its first jet certified soon and Faury expects the manufacturer bankrolled by the Beijing government to be a “strong player in the world in the next decade”. It’s partly because of this he’s keen to settle the long-running WTO case between Airbus and Boeing about state subsidies worth billions over decades that have resulted in tariffs. “I call them ‘thin subsidies’ compared to our turnover and investments. They are small compared to the way Comac is funded by public money in China.” Faury’s argument is that if the US and EU cannot agree a deal then why should China play by WTO rules, effectively allowing Beijing to subsidise its nascent aerospace industry into becoming a world power. Besides, he adds, transatlantic tariffs are a “lose-lose game that doesn’t make sense” when aerospace has been hammered by the pandemic. Also on his radar is Brexit. Airbus has had a difficult relationship with the UK since the referendum, being the most vocal international company to sound the alarm about risks from Britain crashing out without a deal. Airbus’s blunt “Brexit impact assessment” in 2018 warned of the dangers posed to the company’s 15,000 UK staff and many more in the supply chain who feed into the company’s wing-making plant in Wales, and design centre near Bristol. A hard Brexit would mean “severe disruption and interruption of UK production, forcing Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country”. Six months later the company doubled down, releasing a video with then chief executive Tom Enders – who Faury succeeded – warning of “potentially very harmful decisions”. Leave activists labelled it as “Project Fear”. They could be right. Airbus is still firmly in the UK, although the company could not simply uproot overnight and move wing production elsewhere. “It was a different time in the long and painful process of Brexit,” says Faury. He says the company was “very clear on Brexit’s risks” and is “very happy” a trade deal was reached.  Suggestions that Airbus’s stance might have damaged the company are dismissed. “Tom is Tom and Guillaume is Guillaume,” he says referring to his predecessor’s approach, adding his “own messaging to the UK has been a different nature”. Britain offers a very competitive environment, supported by an ecosystem of suppliers, and a government offering R&D support, such as backing for the next-generation “wing of tomorrow”. But this position can’t be taken for granted. “As long as the ecosystem is competitive we are happy to be here, but that rule applies to the rest of the world,” says Faury. “Everybody has to bring their share, including governments.” But while he takes with one hand, Faury seems willing to give with the other. The UK defence review announced a replacement fleet of helicopters, which Airbus also makes. For it to win such a contract would require something in return, such as a commitment to make them in Britain. Faury laughs when asked about the possibility of moving production out of Britain. “We want to grow in the UK. We will be willing to do more than we are doing to today, to have a win-win for the UK and Airbus.”"
,business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/04/deliveroo-flop-another-sign-tech-bubble-primed-burst/,"‘Fantastic”, said Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, on hearing of   over the supposed attractions of New York for its mooted £7.6bn stock market flotation. It seemed like a public endorsement of government proposals to   to make them more friendly to tech newcomers and high fliers such as Deliveroo’s food delivery business. “A great British success story”, purred the Chancellor, confirming that the UK was “one of the best places in the world to start, grow, and list a business”. Oh dear. We’ve been hearing a lot of this kind of needy, cheerleading guff from ministers since Brexit three months ago, as if merely stating that Britain is now a “world beating” nation somehow makes it so. Investors duly delivered their verdict on the float with a giant raspberry.  , making this one of the most disastrous IPOs in memory. The Chancellor should stick to the day job of managing the public finances, which by the way are in the worst shape since the Second World War, if he wants to make Britain best in class. As it is, those planning to list in London have a   to look forward to. What must make the whole thing so galling for Deliveroo’s founder and chief executive, Will Shu, is that there were lots of alternative ways for him to take his company public, most obviously via a US  . This is the route chosen by the online car dealer Cazoo and a number of other UK-based growth stories. It would have been less high profile, but against what has just happened this now looks as though it would have been a positive advantage. Last week’s mispricing has inflicted  . The specifics of what went wrong have already been well aired, but nevertheless bear some repeating. For a start, the timing was unfortunate. This might seem an odd thing to say in view of the rocket boosters that a year of Covid has put on home delivery services such as Deliveroo, but it also coincided with one of those perennial bouts of nerves in markets over rising tech valuations.  are everywhere to be seen. Nobody wants to get caught out afresh, with the Dotcom bust still recent enough not to have been wholly forgotten. Tech has been the big winner from the pandemic, which has greatly accelerated the transition into the digital age. But Covid has also been a ventilator of cheap money, sending valuations soaring to implausibly high levels. Even though priced at the bottom of the target range, the valuation chosen for Deliveroo, a business that remains loss-making despite the gains of the last year, was still too high to stomach. Some investors, notably Legal & General, Aviva and Aberdeen Standard Investments, blame their decision to shun the issue on the super voting rights the company’s capital structure bestows on its founder. As such, it amounts to a big pushback against two recently published government reviews – by Jonathan Hill, former European financial services commissioner, and Ron Kalifa, former boss of Worldpay. Both recommended easing the listing requirements to allow companies with dual voting structures to qualify for a “premium” listing on the FTSE 100. Once in the index, tracking funds would be required to buy the stock, significantly adding to the pool of demand. This in turn would help London woo tech flotations. Together with other suggested reforms, it would also open the doors to Spacs, the investment craze sweeping Wall Street that has thus far similarly bypassed the London market. City-based institutional investors may not be quite the forces they were. Globalisation and the forced march into so-called “risk-free” assets has greatly reduced their ability to call the shots in UK equity markets. But by boycotting Deliveroo, they have sent out a powerful message; we do not want New York’s lax standards over here. If the tech boom does all end in tears, then it offers at least some protection. But it also means that the choicest of UK tech start-ups will choose the US to list their shares. As a “caveat emptor” man, I nevertheless find their stance a little odd. It also involves double standards. Dual voting structures have long been tolerated at both Schroders and Daily Mail & General Trust. Provided there’s full disclosure, personally I cannot see the problem in allowing almost anything to float. If this sounds irresponsible, just consider the nonsense that the growing mountain of listing and corporate governance rules gives rise to. It’s not just the box-ticking bureaucracy of it all, it also creates the illusion of safety without actually delivering the real thing, allowing investors to abdicate responsibility for their own decision making. An anything goes environment would by contrast promote a more self-interested approach to risk, forcing investors to pay attention rather than relying on prescribed rules to do the work for them. Better and more efficient allocation of capital would follow naturally. As it is, concern over dual capital structures gave institutions a ready excuse for not investing in a company we now know was seriously overpriced. There’s an irony there. Marketed as tech, Deliveroo is in truth little more than an army of self-employed delivery workers, albeit one supported by a remarkably clever app. Nor is it by any means unique. Just Eat and Uber Eats provide fierce competition. Both rivals, moreover, have deeper pockets, as witnessed by the reputed £5.4m Just Eat paid Snoop Dogg to advertise its service. If wondering why an act as big as his should turn its talents to selling fast food to the Brits, note that his little ditty covers Just Eat/Deliveroo clones all around the world. Try substituting Just Eat with “Menulog”, the Australian version of Deliveroo recently acquired by Just Eat, to see what I mean. Never mind rampant tax avoidance, most tech companies pretend to be big on environmental, social and governance standards. Yet far from benefiting Deliveroo, this too helped to undermine its float. Objection in principle to Deliveroo’s reliance on the zero hours gig economy has joined together with real world worries about how sustainable that way of operating is likely to be. If forced to treat workers like employees, the business model would be finished. Just Eat is again less exposed on this front. In any case, there is a sense in which institutional investors have hidden behind the public relations charade of ESG concerns to showcase genuine doubts about hyped valuations. In an internal memo, Deliveroo’s finance chief urged staff to take heart from last week’s debacle. Increased market volatility meant that 85pc of European and US listings launched in the past week are trading lower than the offer price, he noted. Indeed so; the bubble may already be bursting."

,business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/03/global-thirst-oil-intensifying/,"On Wednesday March 23, the day a  , the oil price jumped 6pc – to around $61 per barrel. It was a stark reminder of the very physical nature of the global trade in crude. Around a tenth of all refined oil bought and sold internationally each day travels through the  . After six days, with hundreds of tankers and container ships waiting, Egyptian tugs and diggers  , allowing others to pass. Oil prices duly fell. The Opec oil exporters’ cartel is much less visually compelling than drone shots of a giant ship wedged sideways in one of the world’s most vital trade arteries – particularly when the group’s meetings are held via video conference. But last Thursday’s Opec+ summit – comprising the 13 full members, together with 10 allies, including Russia – will have a far more significant and lasting impact on efforts to contain global energy costs than the mad scramble to unblock the Suez Canal. For Opec+ has decided gradually to raise oil production over the next three months, meeting the predicted increase in crude demand as the global economy emerges from the Covid pandemic. That should keep crude prices in check and, broadly speaking, is good news for the post-virus recovery ­– particularly in oil-importing nations such as the UK. At the start of 2020, oil was around $60 a barrel. As Covid struck, and the world went into lockdown,  . With airlines everywhere grounded, and much industrial production shuttered, demand for the black stuff was extremely slow. By April 2020, oil was trading well below $20, over 70pc down since the start of the year. Some localities even saw “negative pricing”, as crude kept coming out of the ground, for which there was no immediate use, and the market came up against physical limits on storage capacity. Faced with this price collapse, Opec+ agreed last April to   – around 10pc of global demand. During the year since, as economic activity has gradually restarted, not least in Asia, the group has gradually unwound these cuts to about 7m barrels daily, meeting each month to assess the global recovery and decide how much additional oil to release. By the start of October, oil was back around $40 per barrel. And, since then, as vaccines have emerged, prices have rallied – rising to $65 by mid-March, up 60pc in less than six months. And this is based on more than just optimism that vaccines will unlock the global economy. Over recent years, for instance, US shale producers have helped transform America into the world’s biggest oil producer, if still a major net importer of crude. Yet many such outfits so far haven’t responded to higher prices by restarting some of their own suspended output. Shale production is expensive. The price may not yet be high enough to trigger increased drilling among US domestic producers, who seem reluctant to take on more debt. The oil rally has been driven by geopolitical factors, too. Now Joe Biden has won the presidency, he seems less likely than previously expected to seek rapprochement with Iran. So Iranian oil will remain sanctioned, excluded from global markets. Intensifying rivalries between China and Western nations has also seen Beijing take steps to accelerate oil purchases, building its strategic energy reserves. Another important factor has been a weaker dollar. The US currency and oil prices are, historically, inversely-related – seeing as crude is priced in dollars, so when the currency is strong you need fewer dollars to buy the same barrel. From March to December 2020, the US dollar index – measured against the currencies of America’s main trading partners – fell by a tenth, pushing crude prices up. Pivotal, though, in this rally has been Opec’s broadly united effort to honour the deep supply cuts it imposed when Covid struck last spring. Opec has been concerned the global recovery may be more sluggish than expected. In December, the cartel agreed to raise output by 500,000 barrels per day each month. But after doing so in January, it suspended further increases as economic uncertainty loomed. That drove prices higher, towards $70 – and by early March some analysts were predicting crude could hit $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014. Such talk was silenced the week before the Suez blockage, when the oil price plunged 9pc in a single day. Speculative pressure in the market suddenly dissipated once it became clear the   meant much of the continent was returning to lockdown. Since then, prices have remained steady, waiting for Opec’s move. Under Thursday’s agreement, Opec+ will raise production by 350,000 barrels a day in both May and June and by 441,000 barrels daily in July. Saudi Arabia will meanwhile unwind the additional cuts of one million barrels a day it has been making voluntarily. Pre-Covid, the world consumed around 100m barrels of oil a day. So these increases are relatively modest. Yet some analysts had expected Opec to avoid any additional production at all. It would appear that Saudi has yielded to pressure from Russia and other exporters to raise output. This reflects a view that, despite Europe, the worldwide thirst for oil will intensify over the coming months, as global growth picks up. I think that’s right – and this Opec agreement, while broadly supportive of oil prices, should help avoid a sharp spike if energy demand begins to surge rather than increasing gradually. The US dollar index, having gained almost 5pc since early January, will likely rise further.   which, between infrastructure projects and handouts, could top $4 trillion – equivalent to around 20pc of annual GDP. Strong US growth and rising Treasury yields compared to Japan and the Eurozone should drive the dollar higher which, in turn, will help contain the headline oil price. But I still see crude consolidating between $70 and $80 a barrel over the summer, as the global economy recovers ­– even if, for now, much of Europe continues to struggle."
,business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/04/ursula-dividend-shot-arm-uk-vaccine-industry/,"What is Ursula von der Leyen’s most significant achievement in her first year as president of the European Union Commission? If we leave aside teaching a generation of Anglo-Saxon pundits that “von” is always in lower case, the answer to that is easy: the creation of a British vaccine industry. The UK has not been a major manufacturer of vaccines, but the   means we soon will be. In effect, there has been an “Ursula dividend” as the UK works out it cannot rely on supplies from the other side of the English channel, and needs to make more stuff at home. But it doesn’t stop there. The same logic will apply to a range of industries, from power, to transport, to financial services and food. As the EU turns  , supply chains will shorten, and plenty of money will be available for ramping up domestic production. That is a huge potential opportunity – all British business has to do now is seize it. It is hard to see many tangible achievements from the EU’s decision last summer to take control of the Continent’s procurement of potential Covid-19 vaccines. It ordered too few of the wrong shots, failed to invest in production, dithered on authorisations, undermined confidence in the only one it bought in quantity, and then lashed out at the companies making the vaccines in a blind panic. The result has been a  , falling behind such advanced, technologically savvy countries as, er, Morocco and Turkey, and a third wave of Covid is now engulfing the Continent. It hasn’t been great. What it has achieved is turning Britain into a major vaccine player for the first time. Although the UK has a world-class life sciences sector, we were not big on making vaccines. India, China, and of course the United States were far more significant on the global stage, while in Europe, France and Belgium were much bigger players. AstraZeneca was not in the industry at all, and while GlaxoSmithKline was in the big three, alongside Merck and Sanofi, it was hardly dominant. That is now about to change. Faced with threats from the EU to block exports of Covid vaccines, the UK is quite rightly beefing up its own capacity. There are already a couple of plants making the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot, and a bottling operation in Wrexham. Novavax will make its vaccine – stunningly effective in trials and expected to be authorised soon – in Stockton-on-Tees, while GSK will bottle it in the North East. Valneva might be a French company, but the British Government has invested millions in its potential shot, and it will be manufactured at a new plant in Livingston in Scotland. Meanwhile, the huge new   in Oxfordshire will go live later this year with the capacity not just to research new jabs, but to make up to 70m doses every six months. From virtually nothing, by next year the UK will have a world-class vaccine industry, at a time when not only will Covid still be a threat but ground-breaking mRNA technologies are promising a range of inoculations against a whole range of diseases from cancers to dementia. In effect, that is the “Ursula dividend” in action. It won’t stop there, however. Over the next couple of years we will see more examples of precisely the same effect. Take power, for example. It is unlikely that the UK will want to rely on French, Belgium, and Dutch electricity. The French have already threatened to cut it off over trade terms, and, heck, in a crisis there can no longer be any doubt that von der Leyen would impose export bans if we were “unfairly” boiling up cups of tea using European juice while the Continent ran out. The result? There will be lots of demand for more green, renewable energy, and plenty of Treasury cash, and guaranteed long-term contracts, to help make that happen. Likewise, Britain will want to reduce the amount of trade that is routed through Rotterdam, and relocate it to British ports. It is already clear that rigid enforcement of the paperwork means it is now virtually impossible to sell food to the EU, so instead UK consumption of domestic produce will rise. And at the same time, as we will not want to rely on European imports, there will be room for technology such as vertical farms that allow hot-weather vegetables and fruit to be grown closer to home. The City will have to switch to designing financial products for a world market as it gets frozen out of European ones. The list goes on and on. In each case, markets will open up as government and private companies work out they can’t rely on Europe for supplies, or should at least have emergency back-ups in place. The EU is turning increasingly aggressive towards its neighbours. In a crisis, as with vaccines, it will lash out, and impose export controls. That, of course, is up to them. But it creates a huge potential space for British companies. The UK will be far more self-reliant going forward, and far more plugged into trading with Africa, the Pacific and the Americas. Whether that is an improvement in the medium-term is open to question. In truth, both the EU and the UK would be better off with completely free trade, mutual recognition of each other’s standards, and co-operation when problems emerge. But that isn’t going to happen anytime soon. In the meantime British companies should take the “Ursula dividend” and run, seizing the chance to create alternatives, and building new industries in the process. And the people with new jobs making vaccines in Stockton and Livingston should raise a glass to the blonde lady in Brussels – they wouldn’t have that work without her."

Don't let oil and gas workers 'wither on the vine', ministers urged
",business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/04/dont-let-oil-gas-workers-wither-vine-ministers-urged/,"Ministers are being urged not to let workers in the oil and gas sector “wither on the vine” amid concerns about the extent of new jobs in greener energy that they can benefit from within the decade. The North Sea is past its heyday as a producing basin and is also   – in a challenge to   with the help of tax revenues from the basin. It is predicted the 151,000 people employed directly or indirectly in the sector in 2019 could fall to 105,000 by 2030 due to falls in production, according to projections from the trade body Oil and Gas UK (OGUK). Meanwhile, plans for the industry to develop  ,   and other greener technologies could create about 40,000 jobs for the sector in the same time frame, OGUK and Government predicts, suggesting a potential shortfall of several thousand jobs. The 40,000 figure is a key part of a new “transition deal” between the North Sea industry and Government to help the industry adapt towards a lower carbon future, which relies heavily on industry investing billions of pounds into new technologies. Victor Fraser, regional officer for the Unite union based in Aberdeen, said: “The deal is welcome, there is no question about that. But we would not like to think that existing oil and gas workers are not just left to wither on the vine. “A lot of the people made redundant last year [during the pandemic] may never come back to the industry: there is less requirement for them.” One industry source said: “We are all for the transition – we just don’t want to go down a route where jobs get plundered and investment falls. “There’s an assumption that workers in the sector will just be redeployed but it doesn’t necessarily work like that – there are different skills, different locations.” The 40,000 jobs figure has been reached using “standard industry multipliers”, based on the up to £16bn investment envisaged as part of the transition deal. That comprises £2-3bn to power oil and gas rigs with renewable or mains electricity; £2-3bn for carbon capture and storage systems; and £10bn to produce hydrogen. The money is expected to come from both private and public investment, although Government has yet to finalise mechanisms to support commercial investment in many key areas, saying it expects to do so for hydrogen production in 2022. Moreover, the declining interest of cash-rich supermajors in the basin due to its dwindling reserves raises questions over whether enough private investment will be forthcoming. A target has been set of 50pc UK content across new energy projects. Mr Fraser, from Unite, has meanwhile been pushing for more safeguards for oil and gas workers including wider use of collective bargaining agreements. Adding to the pressure from the deal, Government also plans to make it harder for oil and gas companies to get new licences. A government spokesperson said: “We will not leave oil and gas workers behind in the United Kingdom’s irreversible shift away from fossil fuels.”"

George Soros part of £100m bet on Trainline hitting the buffers

George Soros' SFM UK Management is part of a £100m bet against Trainline, making it one of the most shorted companies on the London Stock Exchange. Paloma Partners, a US fund run by Donald Sussman, the largest single donor to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 US presidential campaign, is the biggest individual  . Wall Street private equity giant KKR   when it floated for £1.7bn. The company has cornered the rail ticketing market with its app. It also runs around half of UK rail operators’ websites. Trainline has been hit hard by the pandemic  . Chief executive Clare Gilmartin stepped down last year, handing over to Jody Ford, the former boss of Moonpig. Sales in the year to February plunged 75pc to £67m. It is expected to make an operating loss of £60m. However, Trainline’s shares have almost doubled since November as the UK announced its vaccine programme. James Congdon, head of Quest, an independent broking division of Canaccord Genuity, warned when Trainline floated its valuation was “overpriced”. He said: “The market valuation seemed to reflect the business being bulletproof after their [float] but as we’ve seen, it isn’t. Clearly changes in commuting trends will be a concern for train operators as well as third-party ticket resellers like Trainline.” Barry Norris, founder of Argonaut Capital, which has a smaller bet against Trainline said: “The market is sceptical on the volume of travel and sustainability of Trainline’s take, given its app could be reasonably easily replicated even by a state rail company.” Stock broker Deutsche Bank said that Trainline had faced “extraordinary challenges”. Analysts said it had “materially outperformed” other online companies such as Rightmove and Autotrader over the last six months. Trainline declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr Soros did not respond."

Covid lockdown roadmap: the key dates for when restrictions will end and what rules will change

The four tests will determine whether:   is going as planned; vaccines are effective in bringing down deaths and hospitalisations;  are not rising so fast that the NHS risks being overwhelmed;   do not create unforeseen risks. Another big change is the scrapping of tiers, to be replaced with ""steps"".  Step one, part one applied to all of England from March 8, with the second part from  . Regions will enter step two no earlier than Apr 12, and step three no earlier than May 17.   Step four, which will come into force no earlier than Jun 21, should see ""all legal limits on social contact"" lifted.  The Prime Minister said it was thanks to the UK public ""that we can continue on our road map to freedom"". He said: ""We will meet our targets, offering a first dose to everyone over 50 by the middle of next month, as well as those under 50 who are clinically vulnerable, and offering a first dose of a vaccine to every adult by the end of July. It comes as  and deaths from the virus are at the lowest level since October, official figures reveal. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) findings, which on Mar 30  , suggest there is widespread immunity either due to previous infection or  . As of April 3, a total of 31,425,682 people have received one dose of the vaccine, with over 5m having received both jabs. Completing inoculation of the nearly 30m Britons between doses is the government's current priority moving forward. The third test has triggered early debate, because rising cases alone will not be enough to stop reopening. That will happen only if rising cases risk overwhelming hospitals. The four steps are separated five weeks apart. That leaves four weeks to monitor the impact of the preceding step and one week to give people notice. The reopening is designed to happen uniformly across England, so there is no return to the tier system. Below are the four steps of the roadmap. The dates are the earliest dates at which the next step could happen, with delays possible if the data takes a negative turn.  The first step, which began on Mar 8, is split into two sections, initially focusing on getting   again and reuniting families who have spent so long kept apart. All schools in England, both primary and secondary, have now reopened, with   in schools and at home.  Pupils are expected to wear face masks in the opening weeks. However, students will not be forced to wear face coverings in classrooms, as some will be ""anxious and nervous"" about wearing them, children's minister Vicky Ford has said.  School sports have also returned, both indoor and outdoor, so pupils of all ages can get back to playing football and doing PE lessons. Schools can set their own rules. ‘Wraparound’ childcare is allowed to resume, which means after school sports and extra curricular clubs can take place.  There were also  on Mar 8. Residents are now allowed to have a single visitor, and that individual can visit repeated times rather than the trip being a one-off. The visitor and care home resident will be allowed to hold hands, but other close contact is not allowed. The visitor must get a Covid-19 test beforehand and wear protective equipment. The outdoor socialising rules have changed in the second section of reopening. From March 29, six people from six different households were allowed to meet outside, meaning the so-called ‘rule of six’ returned. Alternatively, two households could also meet outside. This means two families, who potentially together total more than six people, are allowed to meet. This can happen in both outdoor public spaces and in back gardens.  has been dropped, similarly the Government has dropped its “stay local” messaging, meaning that households are no longer explicitly told to remain in their geographical area.  While people will still be encouraged to minimise travel, there will not be punishments for someone who drives a few hours for a meet-up outside, then returns that day.  Outdoor organised sports for both adults and children will also return. Outdoor swimming pools, driving and shooting ranges, riding arenas at riding centres, archery venues and climbing walls are also allowed to open. So too outdoor gyms. The return of team sports can only happen in formalised settings, meaning that five-a-side football matches are allowed but a dozen friends kicking a ball in a park is not. Indoor sports will still be off limits. Also the sports must be organised, so a large group of people cannot gather to kick around a football if it breaks the number limits explained above.  will be allowed to open from Apr 12, if the data allows. People may be urged to only go in alone rather than as an entire household. Retailers will be as the Government seeks to bolster the high street and ensure compliance with social distancing rules.  However, a tourism industry leader said it was ""extraordinary"" that visitor attractions would be forced to remain closed when non-essential retail opened. Bernard Donoghue, director of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva), made the comment as he revealed major UK tourist sites suffered a 70 per cent decline in visitor numbers last year compared with 2019. Mr Donoghue said: ""It's extraordinary to me that you can open Primark and H&M but not the Tate and V&A (Victoria and Albert Museum). Not least because, according to Public Health England, there hasn't been a single case of coronavirus transmission at a visitor attraction in the UK. They've proved to be Covid safe.""  can open again from the same date, but only outside, so pub gardens and outdoor dining will be back. Groups can gather, but with the same limits as above: either up to six people or two households.  There will be no curfews or any requirement to serve a meal with alcohol, removing the  Pubs will be allowed to serve takeaway pints.   on April 6 to justify why he is allowing non-essential shops to open before pubs and restaurants. The legal action has been brought by nightclubs operator Sacha Lord and former Pizza Express boss Hugh Osmond to try to force the early opening of hospitality venues. Boris Johnson indicated on Mar 24 that   when they reopen later this year. However, Mr Johnson said it may not be feasible to implement the plans until everyone has been offered a vaccine, after publicans criticised his plans. The Prime Minister said on Mar 25 that the Government will say more on their possible use in early April, and suggested they could also be based on whether  , as well as vaccinations and negative tests. Staycations will be allowed, in a limited form. One household will be allowed to stay overnight somewhere in the UK, but not with another household. ‘Self-contained accommodation’ will be available to rent, so for example cottages or Airbnb rentals or campsites. However hotels and B&Bs cannot reopen. Hairdressers and nail salons will be allowed to open.  Outdoor hospitality venues like zoos and theme parks can also open. The limit on the maximum number of attendees at weddings and wakes will also rise from six to 15. There will be no change for funerals, to which 30 attendees are already allowed. Gyms can also open but you cannot attend with people outside of your household, because indoor socialising is barred at this point. Gym classes are not yet allowed. From May 17, groups of up to six people and two households will be allowed to meet indoors, so people can enter each other's homes from now.  The Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, stated on Feb 23 that  , although people must remain ""cautious"" until this date.  Pubs and restaurants can open indoors. It is unlikely there will be strict requirements on capacity, but it must be table service. Hotels and B&Bs can open in step three,as can indoor sports and gym classes. Entertainment venues can open too, including cinemas and theatres. New rules will be in place for different sizes of venues. Normal outdoor events can open for up to 4,000 people or 50 per cent of the venue capacity, whichever is smaller.  Similarly normal indoor events can open for up to 1,000 people or 50 per cent capacity, again whichever is lower. For huge outdoor seated venues there is a special limit. Up to 10,000 attendees will be allowed or 25 per cent capacity, whichever is lower.  This means, for example, Wembley Stadium will be able to open with 10,000 fans attending. Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, said that coronavirus ""certificates"", were being considered as a way of getting people back to larger events ""in significant numbers"" from Jun 21. ""We're piloting the different things that will enable that to happen - clearly it will have to be done in a Covid-secure way"", he said. ""You would expect, and we will be testing these things, things like one-way systems, things like masks, things like hand hygiene and everything else. ""Another thing that we are considering is a Covid certification, and we will be testing whether we can use Covid certification to help facilitate the return of sports."" Weddings, receptions, wakes, funerals, and other life events like Bar mitzvahs and christenings will be allowed to be attended by up to 30 people. This will be as close to normal as possible. There will be no attendance limits on weddings and funerals. Big venues that were unable to open last year, such as nightclubs, can finally reopen. Many of the details for what can happen now is dependent on a number of reviews. There are four reviews that have been commissioned that sit below the roadmap. They are designed to find answers that right now the Government feels it cannot give. Each has a ‘complete by now’ date, meaning we know when to expect clarity but not what the review will decide or if it will lead to a change in the rules. One review is looking at international travel. It will see whether with vaccine certificates and testing the border can be more open than it is now. This must conclude before step three on May 17 but could report back in April. That means - theoretically at least - the borders could be relaxed in time for summer holidays. However there is no guarantee the current rules, which bar anyone from travelling overseas for holiday, will be lifted after the review, meaning summer holidays abroad are not guaranteed. It comes as Boris Johnson confirmed that the UK’s holiday roadmap will be unveiled on April 5. The Government’s Global Travel Taskforce was expected to report on April 12, but at a Government press conference on Mar 28 Mr Johnson confirmed the announcement will be made one week earlier than planned , with further detail to be given on April 12. But many experts have warned that Covid variants  . New regulations that passed with the review of coronavirus restrictions on Mar 25 include a provision to ban leaving the United Kingdom ""without a reasonable excuse"", meaning those leaving the UK without a valid reason could face a £5,000 fine. Exemptions include work, volunteering, studying, elite sports, legal obligations, medical reasons, care and assistance to vulnerable person, wedding of a close family member - but   going on holiday. Matt Hancock confirmed in an interview with   on Mar 23 that this policy will come into force in the week of Mar 28. A second review will look at social distancing measures. These include the keeping of two metres apart outside (or ‘one metre-plus’ inside), wearing face masks and being encouraged to work from home. That review is due to report back before stage four, which is Jun 17. In other words, do not expect to be told to go back to work in an office until the summer at the earliest. A third review will look at Covid vaccine certificates being used domestically. This is interesting as Government ministers had previously played down that possibility.  understands that   could be introduced at theatres, football matches, business conferences, wedding venues and  . But Covid , The Telegraph revealed on April 3. The Prime Minister has confirmed that Michael Gove has tasked in  , in which the ""deep and complex issues"" surrounding the introduction of immunity certificates will be examined. Mr Johnson skirted the issue on Mar 24, stating that the use of vaccine passports in pubs may be up to the discretion of individual landlords. It is understood that the Government remains concerned about the implications of such steps and will weigh moral and ethical implications of any moves like this. It will report back by step four, which is Jun 17. The fourth review will look at large events. It will attempt to work out when it is safe for large events to be held again. It too will report back by step four, so Jun 17. Pilots for big outdoor events will be allowed to take place from April."

Scotland should look at scrapping ‘not proven’ verdict, Nicola Sturgeon says, amid ‘shamefully low’ rape conviction rates
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/04/scotland-should-look-scrapping-not-proven-verdict-nicola-sturgeon/,"It is time to look at whether Scotland retains its controversial ‘not proven’ verdict, Nicola Sturgeon has said, as part of efforts to tackle the “shamefully low” conviction rates for rape and sexual assault. The verdict, which is unique to the Scottish justice system, is one of three possible verdicts alongside guilty and not guilty, with the accused being acquitted and innocent in the eyes of the law under ‘not proven’ as they would be if found not guilty.  Both the Scottish Tories and Greens have pledged to abolish the ""archaic"" and ""unfair"" verdict as the  , with the Conservatives demanding that Ms Sturgeon fully commit to abolishing the verdict after 14 years in power.  Latest figures show that fewer than half - 47 per cent - of attempted rape and rape trials in Scotland result in a conviction, while more than one in five result in a ‘not proven’ verdict.  Research in 2019 also found that the availability of the verdict may push more jurors towards acquittal before they have even discussed the evidence. At his criminal trial last year, former First Minister Alex Salmond was after a jury found him not guilty of 12 charges of attempted rape, sexual assault and indecent assault, and came to the verdict of not proven on one charge of sexual assault with intent to rape. Not proven is seen by some as offering additional protection to the accused by ensuring they will not be convicted if the jury has any doubts, while critics argue that it is confusing for juries and can stigmatise an accused person by appearing not to clear them. Nicola Sturgeon, who trained as a lawyer, revealed she has personally changed her mind on the issue. Speaking to PA Scotland, the First Minister said: ""I do think it is time to look at the not proven verdict."" Recalling when she studied law at Glasgow University, she said it had been ""imprinted on my brain"" that the ""three totemic things"" that make Scots law distinctive were the not proven verdict, the need for corroboration in trials with evidence coming from more than one source, and that there are 15 people needed to make up a jury. In the past she said ""maybe I have had a bit of a lawyers' view"" of the not proven verdict. But she added: ""The conviction rate for rape and sexual assault is shamefully low. And I think there is mounting evidence and increasingly strong arguments that the not proven verdict is a part of that.” Ms Sturgeon’s intervention comes amid increasing calls to scrap the verdict from campaigners and other political parties. Rape Crisis Scotland launched a campaign in 2018 along with the woman known as Miss M, who successfully sued the man cleared of raping her for damages in the civil courts, and have urged all parties to back abolishing 'not proven' in their Holyrood 2021 election asks. Meanwhile, Scots Tory leader Douglas Ross highlighted a ""disproportionate number of not proven verdicts in rape cases"" which he said ""certainly doesn't deliver for the victim and it still leaves the accused with an uncertain verdict"". In response to Ms Sturgeon's comments, Mr Ross demanded that the SNP ""fully u-turn"" and ""commit to abolishing"" the verdict rather than offering ""more warm words"" after 14 years in power.  Also pledging to abolish the verdict, Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater described it as an ""ambiguous third option"" which is ""unfair on both complainers and the accused"" and is ""disproportionately used in rape trials"" where the ""victim faces a torrid time in court"". MSPs previously voted in February 2016 to reject an earlier bid to abolish the not proven verdict from Scotland's courts. A recent review into how Scotland’s justice system treats rape cases has also made a series of recommendations, including the setting up of a specialist court to deal with serious sexual offences. The review, which was led by Lady Dorian - Scotland’s second most senior judge - suggests cases could be heard by a single judge and without a jury. Among the panel's other proposals are for juries to be given ""plain language directions"" with a pilot programme looking at how jurors can be told about rape myths and stereotypes.  The right for the complainer not to be identified should also be expressly set out in legislation rather than relying on the current convention, the group recommended, and complainers should have access to publicly funded, independent legal representation to oppose applications asking questions about their previous sexual history. At the proposed specialist court, cases would be presided over by a combination of High Court judges and sheriffs who had received trauma-informed training in the presentation of evidence of vulnerable witnesses. Rape Crisis Scotland, Scottish Women's Aid, Victim Support Scotland and the Crown Office were all involved with the review, and evidence was also taken from judges, the court service, lawyers and police. "

What will Boris Johnson announce on Monday? The options for easing lockdown, travel and Covid passports
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/03/boris-johnson-april-12-lockdown-roadmap-travel-restrictions/,"Boris Johnson is set to update the country on Monday about the next  . The Prime Minister is expected to announce whether England can move to the next stage of reopening – and he could  give an update on reopening borders and Covid passports. He could also confirm if hairdressers and beer gardens will be allowed open on April 12. Here's what we know about his announcement. In his press conference on Easter Monday, the Prime Minister is expected to do three things: Here are the details. Mr Johnson's roadmap is underpinned by four key “tests” linked to data, which act like a checklist that must be met before moving onto the next step of reopening. England has  , including getting schools open again and dropping the 'stay at home' order. Four criteria must be satisfied before England can move to the next step of the roadmap, pencilled in for April 12. They are: that the vaccine roll-out is going as planned; that vaccines are effective in bringing down deaths and hospitalisations; that case numbers are not rising so fast that the NHS risks being overwhelmed; that new variants do not create unforeseen risks. Mr Johnson is due to meet with scientists over the Easter weekend to analyse the latest data on cases, deaths and hospitalisations, as well as the success of the vaccine roll-out. If the criteria are met, England will move to Step 2 on April 12. That would mean: Mr Johnson's roadmap, announced in February, promised to give businesses time to prepare for the changes, which is why the announcement could come as soon as Monday. The Prime Minister is also set to update the country on whether borders can reopen. He may not make a concrete policy announcement, but Mr Johnson could give an indication of his thinking on loosening Britain's borders. Mr Johnson is expected to signal on Monday that,  , restrictions will be based on a traffic light system under which   according to their risk based on vaccination levels, Covid rates and prevalence  . Those grades are set to be linked to data, including cases and deaths, new variants, and the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated.  Vaccinated Britons could avoid Covid tests and the need to quarantine, under plans seen by The Telegraph. All travellers returning to the UK would be expected to have pre-departure Covid tests irrespective of   under proposals drawn up by the Government's global travel taskforce.   Only countries with high vaccination and low Covid rates are likely to be on the green list with an analysis,  , suggesting just a dozen countries such as Israel, Gibraltar and Malta will be open to British holidaymakers by June. That taskforce is being led by Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary. Mr Johnson is not expected to reveal on Monday exactly when borders will be loosened. Mr Johnson is set to announce details of pilot schemes to test Covid passports. The Government defines Covid certificates or passports as something that can show you have had either a jab, a negative test, or antibodies. The pilot schemes are set to held during large events in April and May and will test how major gatherings can happen safely again. As  , tests will include the FA Cup final, an FA Cup semi final, the League Cup final, and the World Snooker Championships. The organisers of the Brit Awards ceremony are also in talks about participating in the scheme. The Government could turn one of the NHS smartphone apps into a digital Covid passport, meaning you can carry around with you proof of vaccination, a test, or antibodies. Mr Johnson is not expected to announce significant detail about the plan on Monday, but he is rumoured to be preparing to rule out using passports in certain settings, such as hospitals, GP surgeries and supermarkets. However, the Prime Minister could issue guidance on how the passports would link to loosening social distancing rules, such as allowing pubs to open without indoor restrictions. This review into Covid certificates is being led by Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster."

Government to ban advertising of 'cruel' elephant ride holidays
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/04/government-ban-advertising-cruel-elephant-ride-holidays/,"Travel companies which advertise ""cruel"" elephant riding holidays will face steep fines under new government legislation, the Telegraph can reveal. After years of campaigns from animal activists including the Prime Minister's fiancee Carrie Symonds, the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has indicated that it will ban the adverts. Under the proposals, advertising or selling low welfare tourist experiences to consumers at home that involve Asian elephants could be banned. This would include elephant rides, washing or bathing with elephants, elephant shows or bottle feeding baby elephants. All of these practices are associated with poor welfare standards. Campaigners have pointed out that elephants often have their spirits broken in order to be tamed, which includes being beaten. Ms Symonds has spoken out on multiple occasions against elephant riding, and has tweeted: ""Far too many tourists go on elephant rides not realising just how cruel it is. To tame elephants they break their spirits by whipping and cutting them and tying them up in pain."" More than 3,000 elephants are currently used as tourist attractions in Asia, according to World Animal Protection, with many of these being held in inappropriate conditions including being tethered day and night to three-metre chains. Duncan McNair, CEO of Save The Asian Elephants said: ""“Save The Asian Elephants has been engaged in continuous discussion with Government over a long period, providing extensive evidence of abuse to captive Asian elephants in tourism and calling for a prohibition by law and penalties for the advertising of horrific holiday experiences involving elephants. ""We are extremely pleased that Government is acting on these calls. We look forward to the day when Government formally announces measures. It cannot come too soon for the elephants and STAE will not relent in its advocacy for them. These majestic and endangered animals deserve a life of dignity, free from cruelty and pain. A ban on advertising is an essential step towards that.” Sources at Defra pointed out that elephants are complex, social creatures, and that certain experiences that tourists can engage in involve harsh training and unnatural behaviours for these animals and do not result in their welfare needs being met.  Companies and individuals found to be illegally advertising these experiences would face financial penalties. Government departments including the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, as well as Defra and the Foreign Office, have been negotiating for years on this issue, and have finally come to an agreement which means legislation can go forward. There have been concerns that it would be difficult to regulate and hit British companies. This announcement is coming as part of a raft of animal welfare measures, including taking steps to end live animal exports and crack down on the illegal smuggling of dogs and puppies, as well as consulting on a ban for fur and foie gras. Environment Minister Lord Goldsmith said: “Asian elephants are extraordinarily intelligent creatures and often face unimaginable abuse and exploitation in the pursuit of profit. “The Government is absolutely committed to doing all we can to promote the welfare of this incredible species and we are looking very closely at what measures we can take to ensure that they are given the respect and level of protection that they deserve.” The proposals would include certain exceptions such as advertisements for visits to genuine elephant sanctuaries where tourists are kept separate from elephants and which support vital conservation work."

Home radiators will have to be 10 degrees cooler for Britain to reach climate targets
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/04/home-radiators-will-have-ten-degrees-cooler-britain-reach-net/,"Radiators would have to run 10 degrees cooler under changes to homes needed for Britain to hit net zero, the public has been warned.  The Government has said it wants 600,000 heat pumps replacing gas boilers every year by 2028 to help decarbonise the country’s home heating, which accounts for 10 per cent of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions.  But MPs and experts have warned that without a massive programme to address the UK’s draughty homes and scale up engineering skills, people could be left in the cold by the technology, which works by drawing in heat from the air or ground outside. While gas boiler heating systems can pump 60C water into a home’s radiators, the Climate Change Committee, which advises the Government, assumes heat pumps will operate at 50C. To keep homes warm, that may require bigger radiators, underfloor heating and improved insulation, with full modifications estimated to cost on average £18,000. Homeowners will currently have to cover the costs themselves as the government scrapped its grants scheme after just six months.  Heat pumps can reach high temperatures, but become inefficient and expensive to run, though a regular hot cycle is necessary to kill legionella, which can lead to Legionnaires Disease.  Darren Jones MP, the chair of the Commons business and energy committee, said: “It's not the same as gas. You can't just knock up the dial on your wall a little bit and suddenly it gets a bit warmer”.   The UK is nearly  , but the transition has so far been achieved largely by phasing out coal-fired power plants and boosting the offshore wind industry.  The next phase will require individuals to make much more personal changes to the way they travel, heat their homes and what they consume. That carries risks if people are turned off by the transition.    The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) established a behaviour change unit last year to tackle how the Government will persuade people to make the necessary transition.  Home heating is considered one of the biggest hurdles, because of the level of investment and intrusion required to change it.  ""It is a problem to persuade people that they can't necessarily rely on a system which will transform the warmth of the room that they're in, in a matter of minutes,” said Philip Dunne MP, chair of the environment committee. “And that does require education. And it's difficult to do with people who are not committed to the environmental cause. They're just concerned that they're cold.""   It's not just heat pumps that mean homeowners might need to make costly adjustments to their homes.  The Government wants the majority of homes to be EPC C by 2035, and 2030 in the private sector. That means retrofitting measures in the two-thirds of homes that are currently EPC D or below. Measures might include double or triple glazing, solid or cavity wall insulation and underfloor heating. Energy efficiency could be linked to lower mortgage rates, or higher loans to cover improvement measures.   However, the Government has scrapped its flagship £1.5bn Green Homes Grant scheme, which gave homeowners up to £5,000, or £10,000 for low-income households, toward the cost of insulation and installing low-carbon heating, after just six months. The government wants heat pumps to replace gas boilers, but they are bigger, noisier and other changes to homes are needed to ensure they don't leave inhabitants cold.  Experts say heat pumps can warm homes to a comfortable level, provided the right system is installed, and can bring benefits by reducing the flow of indoor air pollution by maintaining a low level of heat. ""[A heat pump] is a low temperature heat system. It’s an advantage, but can be seen as a disadvantage,” said Nathan Gambling a consultant specialising in training heating engineers. ""Ideally all our heat systems in our home should be low temperature, for a number of reasons. Low temperature is a healthier form of heating."" But he warned that heating engineers lack the expertise to ensure people have the right system installed when they make the swap. And information for those wishing to go green in their homes can be hard to come by. “Right now if you want to switch to a low carbon heating, you've got to go on some kind of grand journey of discovery. You need to become a project manager or a building physicist,” said Mr Newey. “It's quite an invasive process in your home,” said Darren Jones MP, the chair of the Commons business and energy committee . ""And because the market is not fully mature yet the cost of installing is very high. You’re looking at 10 to 15k, plus invasive work in your home. “Government, energy suppliers - they're not really talking to customers about this, or explaining that something significant is gonna have to change.” Heat pumps are also a bigger and noisier option than a gas boiler, which could prove an issue when they’re installed on a large scale. “Architects historically haven’t given any sort of thought to the heating. We're given a kitchen cupboard for your boiler. So that mindset is going to have to change,” said Mr Gambling. “We haven't really got to that point in the uptake where we know whether that's an intrusion on people's comfort,” he added. “They're not as noisy as some people think, but then again, noise is quite subjective.” A hydrogen boiler is potentially a much less intrusive option compared to heat pumps, costing around the same as a gas boiler. But hydrogen is not yet ready for use in homes, and it’s unclear when it will be and on what scale. When it is, it’s likely to only be in certain areas, meaning investing in a hydrogen-ready boiler now could feel like a waste of money down the line. It is also going to require some retrofitting of pipes to make them safe to carry the hydrogen.   Accommodating electric cars will mean homeowners need a charger and will face increased energy bills.  New petrol and diesel cars will be banned from sale from 2030, and the CCC wants 64 per cent of all cars on the road to be electric by 2032. Installing a charger at home can cost up to £1,000 to install, with Government grants covering up to £350. This is expected to fall to around £680 by 2040. Electricity bills will increase with daily charging (though still cheaper than fuel costs), making shopping around for the best tariff crucial. Many supply electricity at significantly cheaper off-peak prices which can be utilised if it has smart features. Some can even be linked to the renewable energy supply in your home, such as solar panels, and can sell your excess electricity back to the grid. But with many deals available online, there is a potential for those without digital access to be left behind, warns Dhara Vyas, the head of future energy services at Citizens Advice. For those without off-street parking, trailing cables across pavements is technically illegal. Trials are under way in Oxford to dig trenches to stretch the cables from your home to the roadside.   A BEIS spokesperson said: “The UK has a strong track record in improving the energy performance of its homes, with 40 per cent now rated EPC band C - up from just 9 per cent in 2008. “We are committed to going further and faster, and are investing £9 billion in improving the energy efficiency of our buildings, while creating hundreds of thousands of skilled green jobs. “This includes funding for the first hydrogen powered houses, nearly £700 million for low carbon heating like heat pumps through the Renewable Heat Incentive, and more than £500m this year alone to improve the energy efficiency of 50,000 homes of those on low incomes across the UK.”"

Nationalists on course to win independence 'super-majority' in Holyrood election, poll finds
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/04/nationalists-course-win-independence-super-majority-holyrood/,"Scottish nationalist parties are on course to win a ""super-majority"" in the Holyrood election with Alex Salmond's new Alba Party picking up six seats, according to a new opinion poll. A Panelbase survey for the Sunday Times has found three separatist parties would together win 79 out of the Scottish Parliament's 129 seats, with Nicola Sturgeon's SNP narrowly winning an outright majority of 65 seats. In addition, the pro-independence Scottish Greens would win eight seats. An analysis by Sir John Curtice of Strathclyde University put the Scottish Conservatives on 24 seats, Scottish Labour on 20 and the Liberal Democrats on five. George Galloway could enter the Scottish Parliament as his pro-union Alliance for Unity group may take a single seat.  Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, said the results showed that voting for smaller Unionist parties like Mr Galloway's would only help the nationalists. They would also pile pressure on Boris Johnson to drop his opposition to handing Ms Sturgeon the powers for another independence referendum. Mr Salmond said: ""Arithmetically our argument for the independence supermajority is unassailable. More MSPs supporting independence: what’s not to like?"" The poll is a major boost for him after a separate survey published last week, the first since he unveiled his new party, showed only three per cent support and that  In contrast, the new poll found six per cent backing for the Alba Party. Mr Salmond has said he wants to manipulate Holyrood's complicated electoral system to deliver a ""super-majority"" for independence, with nationalists voting SNP in their constituencies and for his party on the regional list. The former First Minister claimed this strategy could deliver a Holyrood chamber with 70 per cent of MSPs backing separation, despite this only being supported by around half the population. However, Ms Sturgeon has said   after he refused to show contrition for inappropriate behaviour with women. He was cleared of all charges in his trial last year. Sir John said Panelbase's results were ""good news"" for the Alba Party, though a drop of two per cent in support would mean their tally would fall to one MSP. He said: ""Alba may be on the cusp of recording a creditable performance and coming away largely empty-handed. ""Although most of the seats the party could win with a six per cent tally look as though they would be secured at the expense of the unionist parties, our projection suggests that a couple might otherwise have been won by the SNP or the Greens."" He said the Alba Party was appealing to nationalists who want a rapid timetable for a second independence referendum. Up to 70 per cent of its supporters wants another separation vote within a year compared to 48 per cent of SNP list voters. While 93 per cent of those who backed Alba believe that Mr Salmond is ""a fit person to stand for election"", only 13 per cent of SNP supporters shared this view. Panelbase surveyed 1,009 adults in Scotland between March 30 and April 1, with Alliance for Unity picking up four per cent. Mr Galloway has urged Unionists to vote tactically in their constituencies for the party best placed to beat the SNP, then back his party on the list. However, the Tories and Labour are both heavily reliant on winning regional list seats. Speaking on a Radio Forth election phone-in, Mr Ross said the most important finding of the new poll was ""that the smaller parties don't have enough support to win any significant number of MSPs but they do have enough support to allow nationalists into parliament. ""And that's my biggest concern, is that if people don't support the tried and tested method to stop the nationalists, which five years ago was the Scottish Conservatives, then they are actually aiding the SNP or Alex Salmond's nationalists to have our parliament once again dominated by another independence referendum."" But Mr Galloway tweeted: ""Why would you pass up the chance to put me in #Holyrood rather than A N Other? The status quo cartel is what put us in this mess. Clean it out."" Keith Brown, the SNP's depute leader, said: ""This is the most important election in Scotland's history - every single vote will count, and this poll shows that giving anything less than both votes to the SNP means gambling with Scotland's future."""

MPs to get vote on vaccine passports - and could defeat Government in Commons
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/04/mps-get-vote-vaccine-passports-could-defeat-government-commons/,"MPs will be given a vote   before they are introduced, risking a Government defeat in the Commons,   has learnt. Michael Gove, who is leading an official review of the scheme, has privately promised MPs who are critical of vaccine checks that they will be given a chance to vote them down. More than 70 MPs, including 41 Conservatives, have signed an open letter to the Prime Minister opposing the use of vaccine passports. If more than around 60 Tory MPs rebel and all opposition parties refuse to support the passports, Mr Johnson could be defeated in the Commons, and the scheme abandoned.  held a phone call with a group of MPs about the measures last week, after dozens went public with their concerns. One MP told this newspaper: “Michael made a very clear statement on the call with MPs that there would be debates and votes before anything like this came into force”. The Government is currently conducting a review into a passport scheme and has not yet finalised any plans. In  , the Chairman of the 1922 Committee, warns that vaccine passports would be ""intrusive, costly and unnecessary"" when the UK is already in an ""enviable position where more than half the population has got antibodies"". Tory rebels will need the support of the opposition parties if they hope to win the vote and cancel the scheme. A source on Sunday night indicated that the shadow cabinet has not yet decided whether Labour MPs would be whipped to vote against the motion, but Sir Keir Starmer has previously said he would regard a passport scheme as “un-British”. Clive Lewis, a Labour backbencher who opposes the passport plans, said many Labour MPs would join the rebels when the vote takes place. “I imagine there is a calculation [in Labour HQ] that this is something for which there isn't support across the party,” he said. “It would also be an opportunity, if there is a large number of Tory rebels, to inflict a possible defeat on the Government which, especially with an 80 seat majority, is a rare opportunity.” A vote in the Commons could see an unlikely alliance between libertarian Tory MPs and the Socialist Campaign Group, a caucus of MPs on the Left of the Labour Party. Both have been critical of any vaccine checks in the UK, other than for international travel. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, and amounted to “giving up our basic freedoms"". Sir Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said a passport scheme would be “illiberal, unworkable and utterly ineffective”. , Mr Gove acknowledged that there were “a host of practical and ethical questions we have to answer before we can consider a wider rollout”. Although the plans are controversial, Mr Gove said they may “allow us to relax social distancing rules more quickly,” boosting the capacity of venues and funnelling money into the hospitality industry."

Sunday morning UK news briefing: Today's top headlines from The Telegraph
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/04/sunday-morning-uk-news-briefing-todays-top-headlines-telegraph/,"Covid passports designed to return life to normal in Britain might not be ready until the autumn,   can reveal. Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, will on Monday confirm for the first time that a system is being developed that will allow people to return to sporting matches, theatres and other major public events, as well as travelling overseas for holidays.  Britain considered buying an area of Svalbard north of the Arctic Circle to provide a listening post for spies and to increase its post-Brexit fishing waters. Then-foreign minister Tobias Ellwood pursued attempts to buy land on the Norwegian archipelago, a group of islands north-east of Greenland, the last inhabited place before the North Pole.  Playgroup teachers need an ""understanding about white privilege"" so toddlers can learn to ""recognise racist behaviours and develop anti-racist views"", according to new guidance. The new advice, drawn up as an alternative to the Government's statutory guidance by representatives from unions and charities, said it was “time to challenge the widespread notion that ""children do not see race"" and are colour blind to difference”.  Walkers so distracted by their mobile phones that they can't move in a straight line down the street have long been blamed for causing pavement pile-ups. However, researchers have now scientifically illustrated how just a few rogue pedestrians staring at screens can send people behind and approaching them into a frenzy of confusion.  A few hundred Kill the Bill protesters have clashed with police outside parliament after Jeremy Corbyn addressed the crowd. The isolated skirmishes took place in the evening after extra officers were brought in to help unblock the road so a McDonald’s lorry that had turned into Parliament Square could continue on its way through London.   "

'Frankenstein food' row returns as UK urged to lead the way on genetically edited crops
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/04/frankenstein-food-row-returns-uk-urged-lead-way-genetically/,"What if science could edit the DNA of the castor bean so that it does not contain ricin, second only to plutonium as the most toxic compound on the planet? What if we could make peanuts that did not cause deadly allergic reactions, wheat that will not cause problems for those with coeliac disease, or make animals immune to devastating viruses? This is all possible now due to cutting-edge agricultural science where researchers are applying   to crops and livestock. It remains a nascent industry with few commercialised products, but the pipeline is growing and the potential is massive. In Britain, investment and development in genomic editing crops and livestock over the past few years have been curtailed by the EU,  . After Brexit that all appears set to change. A government consultation looking at severing the tie between genomic editing and genetically modified will effectively lift the blanket ban on genomic editing, making it easier for companies and research institutions to plough money into this growing industry and turn their work into commercial products. This is exciting news for people like Professor Johnathan Napier, of Rothamsted Research in Harpenden, one of the world’s oldest agricultural research stations. One of his many projects aims to use genomic editing to reduce acrylamide in wheat, a carcinogenic substance released when bread is toasted. Rothamsted has 15 hectares (37 acres) dedicated to tightly controlled genomic editing experimentation, but until now it has never been more than that. “Now we can think about how we can capture these great discoveries and commercialise them, our ambition is global,” Napier says. Under EU rules there was “almost zero chance” for approval to cultivate and commercialise a GE crop. “That is what has stopped us. But in agricultural research and science the UK punches above its weight, so if we can harness all of the innovation in plant science it could give us a competitive advantage, and allow us to do societal good and give us some income too,” he says. The EU’s treatment of genomic editing as the same as genetically modified is at odds with most other countries, which view the two as separate. Foreign DNA is introduced into an organism for genetic modification. Genomic editing, however, uses “scissors” to edit a DNA sequence by removing a gene at a very precise point, rather than adding genetic material.  , this results in a genetic change that could have happened naturally or taken scientists many years to achieve using the conventional tools of cross-breeding. “In plants, mutations occur naturally all the time and in conventional breeding where you cross two plants together you have no control of all the DNA that gets jumbled up, whereas using gene editing you can be extremely precise.” Taped to the wall in one of Rothamsted’s research labs are two pieces of wheat. One is an old variety – a long stem, with a small head containing tiny kernels. The other, a variety bred in the 1950s, has a short stem, with large, plump kernels that yields six times as much wheat per hectare. “People think agriculture and farming have been unchanged for years, when actually it is evolving all the time and GE will just be a part of that evolution,” Napier says. Professor Wendy Harwood, who leads the crop transformation group at Norwich’s John Innes Centre, agrees genomic editing is speeding up what historically has taken decades through traditional breeding but says caution is needed. “It is a huge advantage, but it also means you perhaps have to be a little more careful.” Like Napier, Harwood reckons the industry is on the cusp of a boom. “If the regulation changes, the UK would become a much more attractive place for research.” She also raises another interesting point: gene editing has democratised the agritech sector, and allowed small companies to compete in a field previously dominated by the agri giants such as Monsanto, Bayer and DuPont. They have been the only ones with the financial firepower to commercialise GM products. Down the road from Harwood, a start-up called Tropic Biosciences is working on gene editing bananas, coffee beans and rice in the hope of making them easier for farmers in developing countries to cultivate. Bananas are the most consumed fruit in the world and Tropic’s most advanced project. It hopes to launch a genetically edited variety in the next three years resistant to Panama disease, which is devastating crops. Tropic was founded in 2016 and despite employing only 100 people is one of the world’s largest agricultural gene editing companies globally. Gilad Gershon, the chief executive, says genomic editing – along with Crispr,   – is allowing smaller players to break into the market. “It’s not a question of should it be regulated or not, it is all a regulated space, it is a question of what is the right measure. If the regulatory process is 15 years and costs £150m and funnels all research into just corn, cotton and soybean that’s not great. If you want to make it accessible to others it needs to be more right-sized-regulation. We don’t want to tie our hands behind our backs,” says Gershon. Tropic has raised about $43m (£31m) since it was founded from investors including Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek, Pontifax AgTech, Five Seasons Ventures and Japan’s Sumitomo Corporation. “These crops have seen limited investment in R&D and could benefit massively,” Gershon adds. Like gene-edited crops, the market for gene-edited livestock is small as the technology is so new and even the US has yet to approve a gene-edited animal for commercial use. Research is picking up, however. British company Genus has for five years been developing a breed of pig resistant to a deadly virus called PRRS, using technology developed at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, famous for creating   – the first cloned mammal. Stephen Wilson, the chief executive, says Genus is engaging with regulators all over the world apart from within the EU. “We disagree with the EU decision to classify gene editing as genetically modified and support the Government’s consultation into looking at whether we should take a different approach here.” He adds: “We have great skills in this country in genomics and molecular biology so a supportive regulatory environment would help.” Up at the Roslin Institute, Dr Simon Lillico, a research fellow at the Centre for Tropical Livestock Genetics and Health, says making animals resistant to disease can also help reduce the use of antibiotics in farming and the threat of antimicrobial resistance in livestock transferring to humans. He and his team are looking at how to make cattle in Sub-Saharan Africa more robust using a naturally occurring gene mutation found in other cattle breeds that gives them shorter hair and greater tolerance to heat. In Argentina, the government has approved for sale a tilapia fish genetically edited to grow faster. “This is a really exciting time to be a scientist because we can do things we couldn’t have done 10 or 15 years ago. The cattle genome is 2.6bn letters long and we have tools to allow us to find the bit we want to change. We will still need approval from the Home Office, but what new regulation will change is the opportunity to do more projects that have a real-world market application, not just for the sake of it,” says Lillico. While the EU is Britain’s biggest trading partner and differing regulation could create obstacles to trade, changing the regulatory environment would allow the UK to trade on an equal footing with other countries that have moved in the same direction. “And most of the world will, the EU is hugely conservative and most of the world is not,” Lillico says. Napier agrees: “It would be great for the UK to be part of that gene editing revolution. That’s the post-Brexit golden opportunity we find ourselves in and it is the logical road to take.”"

US and Iran agree to 'breakthrough' nuclear deal talks in Vienna
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/02/us-iran-agree-breakthrough-nuclear-deal-talks-vienna/,"The Biden administration on Friday hailed a potential breakthrough in deadlocked efforts to revive the Iranian nuclear deal after Tehran agreed to talks through European allies. Britain, Russia, China, France and Germany will be among those meeting with the US and Iran for negotiations in Vienna next week, marking the first major progress in attempts to  President Joe Biden has promised to rejoin the agreement on condition Iran first returns to respecting commitments it abandoned in retaliation for Donald Trump pulling out and reimposing swingeing sanctions. Tehran, however, has said Washington must end the sanctions before it will make any moves to get back in line. The US is trying to use Europe as an intermediary with Iran after the Islamic Republic refused to join direct talks with the Biden administration. The Vienna meeting will aim at drawing up two separate agreements, one with the US and one with Iran on which steps they will take when to return to compliance with the agreement. The two sides will not meet directly. The US would not insist on retaining sanctions, the Telegraph understands, believing that the previous “maximum pressure” campaign waged by the Trump administration  Ned Price, US State Department spokesman, on Friday called the talks a ""healthy step forward"" and said that Washington ""remains open"" to a direct encounter with Tehran. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said he was optimistic the US was willing to compromise. He added: “I very much hope that the anti-Iranian inertia that was observed at first will give way to common sense.” It comes after a year of quiet diplomacy that has failed to produce much headway. The aim is to reach an agreement within two months, said a senior official with the EU, the coordinator of the deal. ""If we don’t get there [within that time frame] ...it will be definitely bad news,"" the official told Reuters. Signatories to the deal are hoping to make headway before Iran holds presidential elections in June, a milestone that could lead to a new Iranian negotiating team and more delays. However, any return of the US would involve complications. Since the US withdrawal from the pact, Iran has been steadily violating its restrictions, like the amount of enriched uranium it can stockpile and the purity to which it can enrich it. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said that over the past two years, Iran has accumulated a lot of nuclear material and new capacities and used the time for ""honing their skills in these areas."" At home, Mr Biden has to contend with opposition from Republicans in the Senate, most of whom opposed the deal - which was signed by the Obama government - in the first place. Analysts say he must not give the sense that he is giving in to Iranian demands."

Biden's $3trillion tax hikes find public support despite Republican resistance
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/03/bidens-3trn-infrastructure-tax-hikes-find-public-support-despite/,"Americans are overwhelmingly in support of Joe Biden’s planned tax hike on corporations and the wealthy to pay for new infrastructure projects, despite Republican opposition in Congress, new polls have shown. The US president earlier this week announced a “once-in-a-generation”  that would be funded by tax increases on companies and those earning over $400,000 (£290,000). Mr Biden’s plan is a test of his belief that he can generate popular backing across the country even as conservatives seek to block him on Capitol Hill. A Morning Consult/Politico poll on Thursday found that by a two-to-one margin voters prefer an infrastructure bill that includes Mr Biden’s proposed tax increases than those that do not, confounding expectation. Only 27 per cent support infrastructure without tax hikes, which broadly represents the GOP’s stance.  It also found that voters support this expanded notion of infrastructure, with measures like increasing housing options for low-income families garnering the support of 70 per cent of registered voters, including 87 per cent of Democrats and 53 per cent of Republicans. The idea of repairing and building roads, bridges, railways, ports and airports is appealing to the general public, especially since much of America's infrastructure dates back to the 1950s and is generally considered to be dilapidated.  In announcing his Build Back Better plan from , Mr Biden said it was time for big American corporations such as Amazon to start paying their fair share. In 2017, then-President Donald Trump signed a new bill law that slashed the corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent. A report out this week found from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that 55 large US companies, including major brands such as Nike, paid no federal taxes last year.  Jennifer Rubin, an opinion writer at The Washington Post, claimed that the Republican framing of policy did not match reality. “There is not a hue and cry over a mammoth infrastructure bill. To the contrary, it is super popular. And Republicans might want to stop harping on the tax increases: Those make the bill even more popular,”   “Biden might just understand public opinion better than his critics”. Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader, and other senior Republicans have branded the bill a liberal “wish list” of wasteful spending. Meanwhile, progressives in the president’s own party are urging him to “think bigger”, proposing $10 trillion in spending. The Biden administration will likely use what is known as ""budget reconciliation"" to pass the bill with 51 votes in the narrowly divided Senate, effectively bypassing Republican opposition. Budget reconciliation is an arcane procedural tool in the Senate that allows the majority party to get over the 60-vote threshold of the Senate filibuster and pass certain kinds of bills on a simple majority. The Democrats could, in theory, set up three separate reconciliation bills: one for taxes, one for spending, and one for the federal debt limit. Mr Biden has been polling high on the economy, as he has on his tackling of the Covid-19 pandemic. The president's approval lands at 72 per cent for his handling of the coronavirus, higher than the 68 per cent of Americans who said the same earlier this month just before Congress passed his record $1.9 trillion relief package - his first major legislative achievement.  Republicans, who no longer control the House or the Senate after spectacular upsets at the election, attempted in vain to block the stimulus bill.  Mr Biden, at the same time, is facing some early tests in his first two months in office, finding himself underwater for his handling of gun violence after three mass shootings in a fortnight and the surge of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border, which has brought at least 18,000 unaccompanied children into US custody."
,politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/04/should-generous-eu-despite-petulant-dangerous-behaviour/,"Like most British people, I want to help our European neighbours. The difficulty is that EU leaders are at present   for Britain to offer assistance. The case for vaccine magnanimity is both moral and practical. We have largely inoculated the groups most at risk here, and there is a straightforward humanitarian argument for prioritising vulnerable people in nearby countries over healthy British twenty-year-olds. There is also a selfish rationale. We want our neighbours to be rich, so that they buy more of our stuff. We want to visit their beaches and ski resorts. We want to reduce the risk of a new strain entering Britain. “You might feel very happy on your little island when you are all vaccinated, but your island might feel very small when you cannot leave it because your neighbours are not vaccinated,” a Commission official told CNN last week. Leave aside the shaky geography (if Great Britain is a “little island”, which does the official suppose are the medium-sized and big islands?). Leave aside, too, the snotty tone. Britain does indeed have a direct interest in the recovery of its region. But it is hard to make that case while EU leaders threaten to seize private property, sequester lawfully purchased supply and annul intellectual property rights. And not just threaten: police raids have been ordered on factories, and export restrictions applied. Pfizer’s vice-president, Danny Hendrikse, says that the EU’s new rules are causing “a significant administrative burden and some uncertainty”. In other words – let’s not dance around this – the EU is risking needless deaths overseas by obstructing the free flow of vaccines. At the same time, EU leaders are   by promulgating scare-stories about Oxford-AstraZeneca. Although the EU’s official regulator has approved it, the sneering of Continental politicians is heard by their citizens. According to YouGov, only 23 per cent of French people and 32 per cent of Germans regard the AstraZeneca jab as safe. In the UK, the figure is 77 per cent. Does anyone imagine this would be happening if it were the Montpelier-AstraZeneca vaccine, or the Freiburg-AstraZeneca vaccine? What we are hearing is not a response to health concerns, but a howl of rage about Brexit. It is an article of faith in Brussels that supranational blocs outperform independent countries. Eurocrats genuinely thought that, by taking over the commissioning process from the national capitals, they were putting Europe in the lead. Plenty of British Europhiles believed the same thing – hence their panic, this time last year, at Britain’s refusal to join the EU’s procurement scheme. The success of a country still viewed by many in Brussels as a renegade province is a psychological blow. What if being outside the EU makes for a nimbler, less bureaucratic, more competitive regime? What if the same holds true in areas other than vaccine purchases? What if the EU brings no added value to its members? What, in short, if it is revealed as a lumbering, ill-tempered, purblind mammoth? Small wonder that Eurocrats want to blame Britain for their failure. Their threats of expropriation are aimed almost exclusively at the UK. Incredibly, they would rather depend on vaccines  , a state which jails opposition politicians, murders critical journalists and absorbs bits of neighbouring countries, than co-operate with their largest trading partner. Oxford vaccine researchers high-mindedly decided to distribute their product on a not-for-profit basis. The world owes them an enormous debt. But all they have had from Europe are slanders and threats. Their vaccine is simultaneously traduced and marked for confiscation. It cannot be repeated too often. If the EU had any legal claim on AstraZeneca, it would go to court. Having no such claim, it has instead given itself the power to expropriate a company that aimed to bring its product at cost to the world. The EU’s justification for its behaviour is almost the worst aspect of the whole dispute. European Commissioners argue that the EU, unlike Britain and the United States, has exported several million doses of finished vaccines. But this is happening because Britain and the US bought and paid for those vaccines. Not only that: they invested heavily in their development. The Dutch plant which the EU is   was set up partly with British expertise. The idea that it is somehow EU property because it happens to be on the soil of a European state is a negation of the international order. Yet, consumed by their anger about Brexit, European leaders are prepared to tear up that order, violating both their own rules and the WTO’s. This is a dangerous game – a lethal game, indeed. International trade always serves to make people richer, but it is never more important than at a time like now. No country will happen to be sitting on all the vaccine ingredients it needs. Even if it did, a mutation, or a different virus, would send it back to square one. Our health depends on the readiness of countries to specialise and exchange. Yet EU leaders would rather disregard ownership rights,   and violate the rule of law than come to terms with Brexit. All this, as I say, makes it hard to be generous. When other countries would accept our surpluses gladly, why start with those that are insulting us? When other leaders would use the AstraZeneca vaccine gratefully, why send it to those who restrict its use? When trusted allies want to work with us, can we justify prioritising a bloc whose president says that we are a dangerous neighbour, on a par with Russia or Syria? Well, we should at least try. Brussels may have settled on a policy of confrontation, but most of the 27 states are our friends. In any case, virtue should be its own reward. No doubt, as in 1944, some Europeans would be grateful, some indifferent and some perversely resentful. So be it. Someone has to stand up for private property, free trade and a rules-based system. Not for the first time, that someone looks like being Britain."

Red Wall by-election fight for Keir Starmer after MP resigns following harassment allegations
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/16/red-wall-by-election-fight-keir-starmer-hartlepool-mp-resigns/,"Sir Keir Starmer is set to face the first test of his leadership at the polls in May, after a Red Wall MP stood down on Tuesday following sexual harassment allegations. Mike Hill, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, resigned his seat weeks before an employment tribunal is to hear sexual harassment and victimisation allegations against him. His departure will trigger a by-election in one of the Labour Party’s most vulnerable seats, which Mr Hill retained with a significantly reduced vote share at the 2019 election after the chairman of the Brexit Party stood against him. The by-election could see Paul Williams, another Labour Red Wall MP who lost his seat in 2019, take on the Conservatives and Richard Tice, now chairman of the rebranded Brexit Party, Reform UK. Mr Hill was suspended from the Labour Party in September 2019 over sexual assault allegations, but readmitted after his accuser’s complaint to the party was “parked”, pending the outcome of an investigation by Parliament’s Independent Complaints and Grievance Process. An employment tribunal for sexual harassment and victimisation will begin at the London Central Employment Tribunal on May 10. Mr Hill strongly denies the allegations. It is understood that he met with Nick Brown, Labour’s chief whip, on Tuesday morning and made the decision to resign. The by-election in Hartlepool is expected to take place alongside the local elections on May 6.  The Telegraph understands the leadership of Hartlepool’s local Labour association is planning to install Mr Williams as their candidate for the by-election on a single-candidate shortlist. Mr Williams is currently the Labour candidate for Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) in Cleveland, but plans to stand instead for the Hartlepool seat in an attempt to return to Parliament. He was previously the MP for Stockton South. The secretary of the Hartlepool Constituency Labour Party, Anth Frain, has written to other members to express concern that choosing Mr Williams, a moderate candidate, without a full selection process will be seized upon by hard-Left Labour members as a fait accompli by allies of Sir Keir. Mr Frain has privately warned senior figures in the CLP that hard-Left members will have to be reassured Mr Williams was the choice of local members rather than Sir Keir’s office. Labour’s vote share in Hartlepool dropped by almost 15 per cent at the 2019 election, following a surge in support for the Brexit Party candidate, Mr Tice. Mr Tice now leads Reform UK, the Brexit Party's successor, and told The Telegraph he was ""actively considering"" standing again. ""We've obviously got some big decisions to make and a lot depends on when the by-election is,"" he said. ""I'm the only one that stands for cutting taxes for the least well off and the lowest paid amongst any of the parties. I think actually there's a very clear agenda that works for the people of Hartlepool."" Mr Tice said if he did decide to stand, the Conservative Party should withdraw their candidate to increase his chance of beating Labour. ""The Tories should say: 'No, Richard, you stand, and let's damage Keir Starmer',"" he said. ""That puts Labour in a right pickle."" A Tory source responded: ""[Tice] doesn’t care about the people of Hartlepool. All he cares about is climbing the political career ladder.” The Conservatives finished second at the last election, but have opened up as the odds-on favourites at 1-2 to win the by-election. Labour are 13-8 to retain the seat, according to the bookmaker Coral. A Labour Party spokesman said: “Mike Hill has resigned as Member of Parliament for Hartlepool with immediate effect.”"

Former Brexit Party MEP dies in Bahamas diving accident
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/01/24/former-brexit-party-mep-dies-bahamas-diving-accident/,"A former Brexit Party MEP has died in a diving accident, Nigel Farage has announced. Robert Rowland has been described as a “larger than life character” who was “enthusiastic” in his opposition to the European Union. The former politician and fund manager died yesterday near his family home in the Bahamas, according to a statement issued by Brexit Party founder Mr Farage. The Royal Bahamas Police Force reported that a man had been found on the seabed during a fishing trip aboard a 39-foot boat off the Caribbean islands on Saturday afternoon. A police report has stated that a member of the party spearfishing in the area of tourist destination Exuma Cays did not resurface. Mr Rowland represented the party as an MEP for South East England from 2019 until the constituency's abolition when the UK exited the EU on January 31 2020 “It is with great sadness that I have to announce the death of Robert Rowland, after a diving accident near his home in the Bahamas,” Mr Farage said in a statement through Brexit Party successor the Reform Party. “Following a successful career in the City, Robert was an enthusiastic Brexit Party MEP and larger than life character. “On behalf of myself, and all those who were involved with the Brexit Party, I extend our sincerest condolences to his family”. Mr Rowland was married to wife Lisa Marie, and had four children. Police on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas are investigating the incident After studying at Newcastle University, where he was first introduced to political activism, he worked in the financial sector with several asset management companies. He was elected with a number of colleagues in 2019 as Mr Farage's party won 29 seats in the European elections. Former Brexit Party colleague David Bull told the Daily Express: ""Robert was the kindest, most gentle, thoughtful friend. He was deliciously funny, dry, intelligent, erudite and compassionate. ""He was a huge support to me in the European Parliament and when I was campaigning in the General Election. “He was a true team player. We started as colleagues and ended up as the closest of friends.” Alongside his political activities Mr Rowland also supported Tickets for Troops, a military charity offering free tickets to music, sports, and entertainment events to members of the Armed Forces. The charity said in a statement:  “We are devastated to hear of the passing of Robert Rowland, a committed and generous board member to TFT. Our thoughts are with his wife, Lisa Marie and their children.”"

US Capitol attack that left policeman dead raises fears over security at Congress
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/03/us-capitol-attack-left-policeman-dead-raises-fears-security/,"Calls are growing to ramp up security once again at the US Capitol and enhance training after a policeman was killed and another injured in a car ramming attack. Officer William Evans, an 18-year veteran of the force, was killed after Noah Green, 25,   on Capitol Hill on Friday afternoon before leaping out with a knife. The question of security at the Capitol has generated a heated debate in Congress amid a highly politicised environment following the Jan 6 riot and former president Donald Trump's role in inciting his supporters to violence. Many Republicans had pushed for security procedures to be relaxed, downplaying any potential threat and calling the measures excessive. The Capitol Police last week began taking down some of the security fencing around the outer perimeter of the complex, easing up on checkpoints and allowing cars to drive closer to the halls of Congress. ""This rips the scab off, and continues to provide a level of uncertainty and worry about the workplace and what’s happened there,” Tim Ryan, a Democrat Representative for Ohio and the leader of a subcommittee that funds the Capitol Police, told The New York Times. “I think everything is going to be re-evaluated after today,” he said. He added that lawmakers were exploring the security practices at other capitals, including speaking to Israeli officials about how they protect the Knesset parliament building, as part of potential permanent security changes at the complex. Chuck Schumer, Democratic Senate Majority Leader, said on Saturday that the Senate Committees are now conducting bipartisan reviews to ensure the Capitol is as secure as possible while also remaining accessible to the public. Retired Lt Gen Russel Honoré, who carried out a six-week review of Capitol security after January 6, urged congressmen to take emerging risks more seriously and provide funding to increase manpower, fortify the building and enhance training to protect officers. The attack was a worrying sign that since the riot the Capitol has become a magnet for angry or disturbed people. It emerged on Saturday that Green,  , struggled with his mental health. Green described himself on a now-deleted Facebook page as a follower of the Nation of Islam, a black nationalist movement, and spoke of going through a difficult time where he leaned on his faith. More recently he had posted about his personal struggles, especially during the pandemic. He also wrote about the “end times” and the Antichrist."

The mistake Remainers make about the British Empire
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/non-fiction/mistake-remainers-make-british-empire/,"Telegraph readers might be inclined to overlook Empireland because it’s praised on the cover by Lefty shock jock James O’Brien (death by endorsement) but, trust me, it’s better than that. The subject is timely. With statues being tossed in rivers and the  , it feels as if the Right regards the past as the repository of civilisation and the Left sees it as a closet packed with skeletons of dead racists, but the reality of the British Empire, says Sathnam Sanghera, was infinitely more complex. It was acquired, as Sir John Seeley famously described it, “in a fit of absence of mind”. Far from a coherent project, let alone a conspiracy, Sanghera calls it “unplanned” and “nebulous… it was never a legal entity, and had no constitution or emperor issuing top-down laws”. It was also controversial in its own time. When Robert Clive, the man credited with laying the foundations of the empire in India, died in 1774, he was buried in an unmarked grave; his crimes had been so great, said Samuel Johnson, that his conscience compelled him to cut his own throat. , now sitting in our museums, were recognised by contemporaries for what they were: booty. At the conclusion to the Mahdist War (1881-99) in East Africa, the Mahdi’s tomb was raided and his skull presented to Lord Kitchener as a gift, who toyed with turning it into an “ink stand or drinking cup” before depositing it with the College of Surgeons, an episode that Queen Victoria regarded as embarrassingly medieval. Throughout the 1846-7 Xhosa War in South Africa, “heads were taken and traded as souvenirs”. There were imperial projects of enlightenment and improvement, yes, and many Britons so fell in love with cultures they encountered that they “went native” – for good and ill. By the 1880s, almost half the British troops in parts of Bengal had an STD. One British officer, far from the embodiment of the “stiff upper lip”, attempted sexual intercourse with literally everything he encountered, animal or mineral, including “a papaya, which proved more satisfying than a melon”. I am sold on the larger part of Sanghera’s thesis, that the empire could be rotten and we don’t know enough about it. I’m not sold on the claim that no doubt attracts O’Brien, that . Brexit, Remainers often say, was informed by a myth of British exceptionalism, that because we once ran large parts of the world, we thought we didn’t need Europe and could go it alone. To prove this, the author quotes a lot of Boris Johnson, an admirer of Churchill who recites Kipling, but the PM is the product of a very unusual public school education – and Brexit was made possible by the support of the working-class, many of whom have never travelled further afield than the Costa del Sol. We are invited to swallow the paradox that the general public are simultaneously ignorant of empire and obsessed with it. If we are uneducated – and a lot of what Sanghera documents is news to me – then I’d add that there’s a lot that defines us that we don’t know about, such as the Vikings, the civil war or the Wycliffe Bible. Historical amnesia is not limited to the long 19th century. But the Left focuses on that period, with some justification, because modern Britain emerged from the twin experiences of industry and colonisation, hence empire speaks to our contemporary concerns around class and race. We are, as Sanghera notes, a multicultural country thanks to empire, yet the empire was also “a wilful, unapologetic exercise in white racial supremacy” that dehumanised black people “on a super-industrial scale”. Whites were persuaded that they were top of the food chain and had a God-given right to be in charge – yet also, when the colonised began to migrate here, vulnerable to invasion. Travel beyond the playing fields of Eton, however, and you’ll find that many people voted for Brexit not to run the world but step back from it, to work on unfinished business back home. Granted, a lot of far-Right boobs backed Brexit, but so did plenty of moderates, some socialists and a roughly a quarter of non-white voters. If they wanted to turn the clock back to any particular moment, it was probably the 1950s, to an imagined time of safe streets and strong communities – to welfare state Britain, not the buccaneering British Empire. A far greater shadow is cast over the present by the Second World War, which is popularly remembered not as a defence of empire (which it was) but as a fight for democracy against fascism – against imperialism, if you will. Sanghera’s point, I guess, is that we are unconscious citizens of Empireland: empire made us, whether we realise it or not. He might be correct, but no one likes being told “I know you better than you know yourself”, and I suspect that the reason why many take offence at the attempt to “decolonise” high streets or the school curriculum is not because they are protective of empire but because they see it as an attempt to politicise their culture and daily life. They also suspect that history is being invoked to compel us to think or behave a certain way, that because Britain is guilty of crimes in the past, we must shuffle into the future with an embarrassed air, perpetually voting for whatever liberals want, to prove that we aren’t as bad as our ancestors were. The history is on Sanghera’s side. The facts speak for themselves. But just as the history of empire cannot be reduced, like Sanghera insists, to simple binaries of good vs evil, nor can the dynamics of historical memory. "

Lord Greaves, Lancashire Lib Dem who fought Paddy Ashdown all the way over deals with Labour – obituary
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2021/03/24/lord-greaves-lancashire-lib-dem-fought-paddy-ashdown-way-deals/,"Lord Greaves, who has died suddenly aged 78, was a radical, independent-minded Yorkshireman who pioneered – from his base at Colne in Lancashire – the Liberal Party’s “community politics” which in the 1970s revived its fortunes in much of the country, A councillor in Colne for 42 years out of 50 until his death, Tony Greaves was a thorn in the side of party leaders from David Steel to Nick Clegg; it was Charles Kennedy who secured him a life peerage. Greaves was a leading dissident as Steel formed the Liberals’ alliance with the SDP, and broke with Steel’s drive for a merger after the 1987 election – though he soon became a Liberal Democrat himself. He was among the severest critics of  ’s efforts to develop close ties with New Labour. Ashdown described one party policy session in 1998 with Greaves at full throttle as “probably the worst meeting I have ever attended”. Greaves was convinced, from the outset, that Clegg’s coalition with David Cameron was a “bad idea”, saying no-one had had time to think the implications through. He stood for Parliament three times, but his strength was as a counterweight to Westminster. As secretary up to 1985 of the Association of Liberal Councillors, and subsequently the guru of local political activism, he was consistently suspicious of policies – and deals – hatched in London. In Colne, Greaves was respected across the party divide for his commitment to the town, and his encyclopaedic knowledge of the Pendle district. One fellow councillor described him as “a force of political nature”. Anthony Robert Greaves was born in Bradford on July 27 1942, the son of Geoffrey Greaves and the former Moyra Brookes. From Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield, he read Geography at Hertford College, Oxford, then taught at Colne Grammar School. Greaves made his mark at the 1970 Liberal Assembly, introducing the motion that committed the party to “community politics” – campaigning on the doorstep to secure initially small improvements that mattered to local people. He served on Colne council (and its successor, Pendle) from 1971, and from 1973 to 1997 was also a county councillor. He fought Nelson & Colne at both 1974 elections, and Pendle in 1997. Editing the party magazine New Outlook, Greaves backed Steel for the leadership against John Pardoe. But he made Steel’s life uncomfortable as secretary of the Association of Liberal Councillors, then as a member of the party’s policy machinery who had started his own publishing house (he was later a second-hand book dealer). When Steel moved to merge with the SDP, Greaves was initially one of the Liberals’ negotiators – but pulled out of the team just before it concluded the infamous “dead parrot” policy document on the merger negotiations. From 2000 he brought to the Lords a whiff of social activism, and to the parliamentary party a resistance to reforms by Menzies Campbell and, subsequently, Clegg. In 2013 he aroused controversy by making light of accusations by four Lib Dem women of sexual harassment from his fellow Lib Dem Lord Rennard, writing: “We don’t know the details, but it is hardly an offence for one adult person to make fairly mild sexual advances to another. What matters is whether they are rebuffed. If the allegations as made are a matter for resignation, around a half of the male members of the Lords over 50 would probably not be seen again.” He later accused the complainants – who by then had left the party – of “a deliberate vendetta” against Rennard. Greaves was vice-president of the Local Government Association, and the Open Spaces Society. In 1988 he published, with Rachael Pitchford, Merger: the inside story. In 1968 Greaves married Heather Baxter, who survives him with their two daughters."

Raise school starting age to seven, Scottish Lib Dems argue

As the first full week of campaigning for the Holyrood elections began, party leader Willie Rennie said delaying the age children start school will help give youngsters a “flying start”. It comes as Nicola Sturgeon promised to   if the SNP is re-elected in May, despite failing to meet her previous pledge of closing the education attainment gap between rich and poor pupils.  Focusing on their plans for education, the Lib Dems hailed the plan as a ""historical, radical and positive change"" in Scotland's school system. They want youngsters to have a ""truly play-based education"" up to the age of seven - when more formal schooling would begin. The expanded early years education would be mandatory, they stressed, and would focus on areas such as child development, social skills and outdoor learning, as well as physical and mental health. Mr Rennie said: ""Scottish Liberal Democrats will introduce a truly play-based education until age seven, to give every child a flying start. ""By learning together through play, children develop the skills needed for trickier tasks and are better prepared to shine in areas like literacy and numeracy."" He continued: ""The UK is almost unique in Europe in expecting children as young as four or five to begin formal schooling. By the age of nine, pupils in Finland have much higher reading levels than pupils in the UK, having started at the age of seven."" Mr Rennie pledged his party would also ""immediately abolish the national testing of four- and five-year-olds introduced by the SNP and heavily criticised by teachers"". Speaking about the standardised assessments, he said that parliament voted to halt them “years ago” but was “ignored”. ""The SNP claimed the support of world-leading experts for the controversial policy, only for those same experts to call it a 'perverse misrepresentation' of their work and conclude the tests were 'completely useless'."" Responding to the pledge, an SNP spokesperson said: ""We recognise that there is a debate to be had and agree 5 and 6 year olds should have 'play-based' education.  ""That’s what primaries do now and, given there is no consensus on increasing age, we do not currently support changing."""

On Thursday, Sacha Lord and I issued proceedings against the Government on the basis that the   was based upon prejudice rather than evidence and was hence unlawful.  It makes no sense to open indoor ‘non-essential’ retail five weeks before indoor hospitality. Within hours of receiving our papers, and with hospitality losing £200 million each day it remains closed, Mr Justice Swift decided that our case was urgent enough to require the Health Secretary to file a response to the court by 10am Tuesday morning. No concession in timing was granted for Easter or the bank holiday.   Like the public, hospitality venues have done everything they have been asked.  They closed when they were told to, spent money going beyond the safety standards set by the Government, and were deemed so safe by ministers last summer that the public was subsidised to come and visit us with the  . Yet today, having vaccinated over 30 million vulnerable adults, and with our ‘Covid-secure’ measures in place, we are banned from opening for a full five weeks after people start browsing and mingling indoors in non-essential shops.    Given the more than three million people who work in the hospitality industry – many of whom are young, female and from an ethnic minority – and the tens of thousands of businesses, suppliers, landlords and contractors, we were hoping for at least a conversation with ministers and officials to find a resolution. Yet we have been told that a meeting would not be ""fruitful"", even though the legal process urges parties to meet to attempt to avoid court.   How can a British government behave like this, saying that it does ""not intend to debate the sufficiency or nature of the evidence and data relied on""?  Nobody, not even government ministers, not even during a pandemic, should be above the law. Thankfully, it appears that the judge agrees that this is worthy of urgent examination. I am hoping the Chancellor supports our cause:  in defending Eat Out to Help Out he said that analysis of PHE data had revealed a ""very small percentage"" of the causes of transmission were hospitality settings, warned of a ""big difference between correlation and causation"", and cautioned against us ""jumping to simplistic conclusions"". Yet the Government’s roadmap opening programme has done just that.  In fact, the Treasury, one part of government that should be good with figures, pointed to official data showing a negative relationship between hospitality venues and transmission. How can the Health Secretary refuse to meet us to discuss SAGE’s advice, while the second most senior minister is contradicting the conclusions upon which the Government is basing the roadmap? In a democracy, evidence and rationality should still matter, and so too should transparency, challenge and accountability.  Government has been given an easy ride in Parliament with the official Opposition being nowhere to be seen. This has led to arbitrariness, randomness and a complete lack of logic in the rules, and we are starting to see it being accompanied by something even more sinister: an arrogance, and a sense that ministers are above scrutiny.   The Government left us no choice but to take it to court and regardless of the eventual outcome of the case, I am grateful to Mr Justice Swift (whose name seems so apt) for recognising that this is a truly urgent matter affecting the lives of millions of people, that simply cannot wait."

Labour to launch 'Clean Up Holyrood' Commission following SNP sleaze and Alex Salmond affair
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/02/labour-launch-clean-holyrood-commission-following-snp-sleaze/,"A 'Clean Up Holyrood' commission is to be launched by Scottish Labour amid concerns that SNP sleaze and the Alex Salmond affair had turned the entire parliament into a public laughing stock. Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, said he was concerned the recent furore over Mr Salmond and the ""institutional failures"" uncovered threatened to inflict similar damage on Holyrood that the Daily Telegraph's investigation of MP expenses did on Westminster. Speaking to a virtual Holyrood press gallery lunch, he said that political games had been played ""on a very, very serious issue around a harassment inquiry"" and ""we have, I'm afraid, at times allowed the parliament to descend and the government to  He said the commission would consult on ideas to ensure MSPs can better hold the SNP government to account ""and win back the trust of the people."" A Scottish Labour consultation will explore reforming freedom of information legislation to create a presumption in favour of ""proactive publication"" after the SNP Government redacted swathes of documents dealing with its unlawful investigation into Mr Salmond. It will also propose introducing the same parliamentary privilege at Holyrood than MPs have at Westminster so they have equal protection from being sued for defamation. Tory MP David Davis, a friend of Mr Salmond's, to disclose SNP messages he said indicated a ""criminal conspiracy"" against the former First Minister. However, MSPs do not have the same level of legal protection in the Holyrood chamber. Labour also wants to examine the election of committee conveners by the whole Scottish Parliament instead of parties amid concerns that some committee members bow to party demands rather than following the evidence. Voters would be given the power to recall MSPs in exceptional circumstances after Derek Mackay, the SNP Finance Secretary, was caught in February last year sending sleazy messages to a schoolboy.  He  and has not been seen at Holyrood since. However, he did not quit as the Renfrewshire North and West MSP and continued to claim expenses. In addition, Labour proposed splitting the role of Lord Advocate, who is both the Scottish Government's most senior law officer and the head of the Crown Office. The tension between the two roles came to the fore when the current incumbent, James Wolffe, demanded the Spectator redact Mr Salmond's evidence to the Holyrood inquiry to remove some parts dealing with allegations Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code. Unveiling the consultation, Mr Sarwar said: ""We are rightly proud of our role in establishing a devolved parliament, but we have to accept that trust and faith in parliament has been lost in recent years. ""We cannot allow the circus that has defined the start of this campaign or the institutional failures that defined the Salmond inquiry to run over into the Parliament of the next five years."" Drawing parallels with the Westminster expenses scandal, he warned against assuming that a furore involving one party or politician ""doesn't impact on the entire institution and the entire body of our politics - it does."""
,politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/womens-vote-counts-dont-women/,"Women are the majority of the population, so our votes count. Obviously we are not a homogenous group. Yet increasingly I hear women voice their political homelessness. Many such women are Left-leaning and have previously voted Labour, Lib Dem or Green, but now they feel unwanted. They feel alienated – dumped by the political parties they once supported, for their refusal to discuss women’s rights under the guise that these discussions are now ‘transphobic’. The Stonewall tactic of ‘no debate’ has been highly successful. We saw it recently when Sadiq Kahn was asked by a member of the London Assembly about the definition of women he’d once put in a tweet: “You’ve said trans women are women – so do you think some women have male reproductive organs?”. Six other members of the Assembly jumped in to shut down debate and supported a subsequent motion to prevent him from having such a discussion with the mayor. His  speech was deemed discriminatory. Whether this member of the Assembly was genuinely interested in women’s rights, or just wanted to pick a fight with Khan isn’t the issue. For me, it is that respectable politicians aren’t willing to define what a woman is. And they are certainly not shy about putting definitions to other people and causes. In the latest report by the Labour Party, “ ” the aim is laudable: to increase representation of trans people in the party and make sure they can take part in all activities safely and “without fear”. It’s a shame no such consultation was ever held about protecting its female Jewish MPs, but there you go. Much of the defining of transphobia is as you would expect until you get to this: “claiming there is a ‘conflict’ between trans people’s rights and women’s or other communities is transphobic.” Herein madness lies. To ask a question or have a disagreement about single sex spaces is transphobic? The word not only becomes meaningless, it loses all contact with the real world. Ask most of us if we support trans rights and we’ll say yes, but when asked if those who have not transitioned in any meaningful way can enter single sex spaces, then the majority are unhappy or just have some questions about it. To not even have this discussion is now considered a win for lobby groups, but it is a loss to many politically active women. Lifelong activists have been threatened with expulsion from the Labour Party and told they must be “re-educated”. These are women who have set up refuges and run trade unions. Is all this a vote-winning exercise? I have heard of canvassers shouting TERF (Trans exclusionary radical feminists) at women on the doorstep when they simply asked about women’s rights. Way to go! The Lib Dems are also fully subscribed to this groovy gender ideology. The likes of Layla Moran spout stuff about not caring about bodies, but seeing into people’s souls. This is the equivalent of those well-meaning liberals who “don’t see colour” and  is frankly, insulting. Many Lib Dem women are unhappy, and the news that one of  their big donors is a company that makes puberty blockers (Ferring Pharmaceuticals ) is more than uncomfortable. The Greens, who don’t like GM crops, suddenly seem to be embracing the case for puberty-blocking hormones and are so fully gender fluid that women exist simply now as “non-men”. The Greens have also embraced Aimee Knight, née Challenor, who is trans, as a Green Candidate for Coventry City Council. When she stood in the 2018 deputy leadership contest, her agent was her father, David who was sentenced to prison for 22 years for the rape and torture of a 10-year-old-girl in the family home. Aimee then joined the Lib Dems but was suspended in 2019 after tweets appeared on her partner’s account about fantasising about sex with children. She has since said the account appeared to have been hacked and the comments were not posted by her fiancé. The key point is, that in order to embrace fashionable diversity, key checks seem to have been overlooked. In Scotland, women have been thrown under every available bus. The women who accused Salmond of inappropriate behaviour at the recent inquiry are now simply irrelevant. Its new Hate Crime Bill does little to actually make the lives of trans people better, but is an attempt to appear more progressive than England .  Bit by bit, women’s sex-based rights are being eroded. Parties formed to protect the environment or to achieve independence have fallen over themselves to get in with the trans rights movement . So there is now a huge number of floating voters who are not anti-trans, but simply want to keep our sex- based rights and protections. Many of us are not Tories. So which savvy political party might speak for us or even recognise that we exist? We are met only with fear, abuse and silence. Do our votes not matter?"
,politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/03/biden-bust-looming/,"Last month, it was $1.9 trillion (£1.4 trillion). This month? Another $2 trillion. Even by the standards of previous occupants of the White House, President Biden is starting to spend some serious money. After  , on Thursday evening he started round two,   pumped into infrastructure, industrial strategy and research projects. It all adds up to the most ambitious round of spending programmes since the free-spending days of the moonshot, the ""great society"" and the Vietnam war of 1960s.  But hold on. In fact, Biden is starting to look more like a South than a North American president. His plans are turning reckless. Sure, there is a case for some extra stimulus to the US economy, although with  , and with a deficit already running at 15pc of GDP, it was hardly frugal to start with. However, his latest programme mixes a punishing rise in corporate taxes with increased welfare spending and a vast expansion of the government’s role in the economy. It is a very Latin America, populist formula. In the past, that mix of policies has always ended in disaster, and there is no reason to think it will be any different this time. A Biden bust is looming - it is just a question of how quickly it arrives.  He may look sleepy, but Biden has already kick-started the most ambitious re-shaping of the American economy in a generation. Last month's stimulus package included a $1,400 cheque - in effect free money - for anyone earning up to $100,000 a year, alongside increases in family tax credits, health care subsidies and unemployment relief. Money is being borrowed, or rather printed, on a vast scale, and put directly into people’s pockets, turbocharging an economy that was already primed to come roaring out of the Covid crisis - the OECD has already doubled its forecast of US GDP growth from 3.5pc to 6.5pc for 2021.  This week, Biden doubled down on his  . In a speech in Pittsburgh, he promised another $2 trillion of spending to create what he described as the ""most resilient, innovative economy in the world"". Of that, $621bn will go into roads, rail routes, and switching to electric vehicles, $561bn into green energy, and $480bn on manufacturing subsidies and R&D spending. There is more to come. The White House is pushing for the minimum wage to rise to $15 an hour by 2025, one of the highest rates in the world (the UK’s, also rising fast, went up to £8.91, equal to $12.30, an hour this week). Big government is back with a bang.  Here’s the problem, however. None of it comes for free. The first round of stimulus was funded by the Federal Reserves. The second round will be paid for by big business. The infrastructure plan will be paid for by steep rises in corporate taxes. The headline rate will go up from 21pc to 28pc, taking it to the same level as France, and way above the norm for the developed world. Even worse, Donald Trump’s reforms of corporate taxes eliminated lots of tax breaks in exchange for a lower headline rate. Biden will keep the reforms, but push the rate back up again, making the effective rate higher than it has ever been. At the same time, a plan for ""minimum global tax"" will assess American companies on their global revenues, making it impossible for them to rack up profits elsewhere. It will be one of the toughest corporate tax regimes anywhere in the world. And yet much of that money will then be recycled via the White House into industrial subsidies. So, to get this straight, the Biden team will take a lot of money from, say, Apple or Google, two of the most imaginative, high-investment, creative companies in the world. They will then hand it over to a bunch of bureaucrats who will, they assume, make better decisions about where to invest it than those businesses would have done left to themselves. Well, good luck with that gentlemen. The rest of us can be forgiven for wondering if Apple or Google, or even their shareholders, might make a better job of deciding where to invest that money.  Add it all up, and it amounts to a massive extension of state control of the economy. The US will soon have some of the wildest spending in the developed world, the least competitive tax system, rising welfare bills, and debt spiralling out of control. And it will become increasingly protectionist as well: one Trump policy that the new President has decided not to reverse is all the extra tariffs he imposed. In Latin America, from Argentina, to Chile, to Brazil, it is a familiar populist mix. True, the US has the dollar, the world’s reserve currency, and it is home to some of the world’s strongest companies, and that will help. The rest of the world will get a boost from all the extra stuff it will import with all that new money (not least the UK, as the US is our biggest trading partner). And yet, it will deliver at best a short-term boom. Over the medium-term, the infrastructure spending will take a long time to arrive, the industrial strategy will pour too much money into the wrong projects, American multinationals, and especially startups, will start to flee a punitive tax regime, and rising welfare and minimum wages will kill competitiveness. The Moonshot/Vietnam spending spree of the 1960s led very quickly to the stagflation of the 1970s. In truth, we are about to see that replayed. A Biden Bust is on the way - and it may arrive a lot sooner than anyone yet realises. "
,politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/03/poor-keir-starmer-mercy-events-much-bigger-capable/,"A year ago, Sir Keir Starmer became leader of the Labour Party. The poor chap’s timing could hardly have been worse. Shops and schools had just been closed, the PM and his Health Secretary had gone down with Covid, and the Chancellor was conjuring vast quantities of cash into existence for a lockdown which, though it was notionally due to expire after three weeks, was widely expected to last longer – Dr Jenny Harries, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, had even suggested that it might be six months before everything was back to normal. With all eyes on Downing Street, no one was paying attention to Labour. A new Opposition leader normally gets a month or two to make an impression, but Jeremy Corbyn’s successor was plainly going to be denied that opportunity. A couple of days before the result, I wrote a column on this page likening Sir Keir’s predicament to that  , who won his leadership ballot on the day that the Twin Towers were brought down in 2001. IDS had all manner of eye-catching initiatives planned for his first six weeks, but no one was watching. He never got a second chance. Had it not been for the epidemic,  : act like a grown-up; move on from Corbynism; expel some anti-Semites; flaunt your patriotism; reconnect with Eurosceptic northern voters. We might question whether these things would have been enough to bring the party back from its worst defeat since 1935; but they would surely have helped. Indeed, Labour almost immediately rose eight points in the polls simply by virtue of no longer being led by Corbyn. But the coronavirus has utterly changed our politics, just as it has changed everything else. Not only in the sense that an emergency tends to make voters rally to the incumbent government. Not only in the sense that a collective threat makes people warier, more patriotic, more conservative. No, far more challenging, from Labour’s point of view, is the new economic situation. A Tory Government is spending vastly more than any previous administration. It is possible, albeit unpopular, to mount a criticism from the Right – to argue that the subsidies are excessive, that the debt will weigh us down for generations and that the furlough scheme is delaying the redistribution of jobs to more productive sectors. But it is almost impossible to make the converse arguments. A Labour opposition that demanded even higher spending would be seen as demented, and Starmer knows it. So, seeking to make a virtue of necessity, he backs both the lockdown and the associated economic policies, confining his opposition to sniping about procedural slip-ups. Naturally, his ratings have sunk in consequence. Labour MPs, frustrated at his lack of salience, want more visible opposition. It is certainly true that Starmer’s personality – bland, pleasant, forgettable – is ill-suited to the times. But the worst possible response is to lurch into a populism that he cannot authentically carry off. Starmer’s occasional attempts to act tough have been painful to watch. In the  , for example, he declared: “Under the Tories, rape has effectively been decriminalised.” That claim is not just obnoxious and untrue. The bigger problem, at least politically, is that it is incredible. Does anyone seriously imagine that rapists are quaking in their shoes at the thought of a Starmer-led ministry? As a criminal barrister, Starmer used to argue against what he saw as Draconian laws. You could agree or disagree with him, but he was plainly sincere. When, on the other hand, he poses as the champion of saloon-bar common sense against a namby-pamby government, he sounds like a nincompoop. In different circumstances, Starmer might have made a useful leader, bridging the gap between his woke parliamentarians and the mass of blue-collar patriots who used to back Labour. But as things have worked out, through no fault of his, he finds himself   while bigger figures shape events. It’s hard not to feel sorry for him."

It’s the cruel romance of watching hardened politicians vainly attempt to start afresh. It’s the priestly talk of principle as they grind their axes. It’s the delicious speculation about whether they will disrupt the system or flop. Alex Salmond’s Alba  . At its recent media launch, the Scottish nationalist was clearly wrestling with his natural belligerence as he outlined his project’s “strategic” aims. These included actually helping his former SNP colleagues to win a pro-independence “supermajority”. His candidates list unveiled a fabulous motley crew of eccentrics. They feature populist bruiser Kenny MacAskill – most famed for lifting the ban on alcohol sales at international rugby union games as a cabinet secretary – and the co-host of Salmond’s talk show programme on Kremlin-backed RTV, Tasmina Ahmed-Sheik. Even a startup party headed by a politician as mired in controversy as Alex Salmond can expect a honeymoon period. A few disillusioned voters may even lend them support in the May elections. And then..? History suggests we shouldn’t get too excited. A few months in and the novelty usually wears off. The poll ratings drop. The political infighting heats up. Breakaway parties are especially prone to this because they attract the most dogged politicians. Such was the case with the SDP. At first it was all chummy media briefings over claret (“agreeable” wine supposedly reflected the party’s “harmonious relations”). Soon members were squabbling over constitutional procedures and MPs who were never one for parliamentary discipline were revolting against their own side. And who could forget  ? Most of us I suppose. Chuka Umunna tucking into a Nandos was the most memorable moment of their “historic” bid to block Brexit. Its calamitous rise and fall presents a cautionary tale: charismatic upstarts tend not to be the most collegiate. Mr Umunna is rumoured to have ditched his own party without even a phone call. Is Salmond set to buck the trend? We shall see.     "
,politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/03/did-free-people-become-relaxed-losing-liberty/,"Before this bizarre chapter comes to a definitive end and life really   (not “new”) normal, it is very important that we make a solemn promise to ourselves and the generations to follow. There must be a full and proper examination of what just happened. In the euphoric relief that will follow on the great unlocking, it will be tempting to dismiss the unprecedented transformation of our social and political condition as a bad dream – a transitory venture into what would, only moments before,   by a free people. We will need rigorous discussion, innumerable historical studies, and limitless debate about the reasons not only for what was done by governments and legal authorities but for the popular acceptance of those measures and the public attitudes that they engendered. If we fail to do this, we will lose what might be the best insight we could ever have had into the nature of liberty. There are broadly speaking two major interpretations of the events of the past year – the extraordinary powers seized by democratic governments and the reaction to those powers by national populations. The more optimistic (and flattering) is that there was a joint assumption of moral responsibility on both sides. Governments and their agencies saw it as their absolute duty to prevent loss of life at whatever cost and they took whatever drastic steps were required to do that. Then their electorates, in a quite remarkable demonstration of altruism and social conscientiousness cooperated with those steps. This was, in effect, a willing renunciation not only of civil liberties as guaranteed by constitutional democracy, but of the most fundamental aspects of common humanity: a supreme act of heroic sacrifice for the sake of the greater good. It could be seen as the fruition of the great democratic revolutions which placed so much emphasis on the conscience of the individual as a member of society. That would be the good news. Then there is the other possible analysis. Populations that have lived under democratic governance for centuries – whose everyday existence has assumed personal freedom to be an indispensable condition of life – were prepared to ditch their birthright overnight in the face of an alarming health threat. Even people who are not devout libertarians should have been provoked into asking the awful questions: just how deep does the commitment to freedom go? Do even the most intimate and instinctive bonds of family relations and physical affection become dispensable if enough fear can be generated? There are plenty of lessons from the terrible ideological wars of the twentieth century to demonstrate the power of induced fear – and the awful lengths to which ordinary people can be led by the propagation of it. Did something like that happen here? Of course, you might say, this was the very opposite: people were not being propelled into committing wicked acts by  . They were behaving unselfishly and honourably, helping to protect others at all costs. Their decisions may or may not have been justified but they were made with the best of intentions. But even accepting that this is true, wasn’t it shocking (or at least surprising) how little resistance or doubt there was about it: how few people actually paused long enough to question the wisdom of shutting down most normal societal relations for an indefinite period, before submitting to the orders? Even if these measures were as good and essential as they were presented as being, they were startling in their severity – much more severe in their effect on private life than were wartime restrictions which never forbade embracing loved ones – and yet very few people seemed to be startled. Isn’t that odd? Is it conceivable that the overriding impulse was not public-spirited generosity but self-preserving anxiety? That the modern obsessions with health and safety easily overwhelmed the principles on which our political system is supposed to be based? It is interesting to note here that the chief arguments used against lockdown have been on health grounds (the risk of other diseases, physical and mental, being ignored) rather than on moral ones (is it wrong to prevent children from hugging their grandparents?). Perhaps the greatest irony in all this is that it occurred in the post-Cold War West which was, until very recently, busily congratulating itself on its bloodless victory over the totalitarian system of the East. The triumph of freedom over those forms of tyranny which specialised in the control and surveillance of day-to-day existence and social intercourse was supposed to be the seminal lesson of our times. Given a choice, it seemed, people simply walked out from under the Soviet police state and brought about its collapse without a shot being fired. Such was the power of the  . Now here we were in the West consenting to a simulacrum of the surveillance and control that we had supposedly vanquished which was arguably more intrusive and limiting than anything the Stasi had contemplated. In the original plan, the post-Cold War discourse was going to be a fairly leisurely business. We would luxuriate in arguments about free market economics and social democratic values, on whether governments should aim for equality of opportunity or equality of outcome. Then suddenly the questions became, should families be allowed to gather together, and, is it legal to have a sexual relationship with someone outside your own household? There must be very few (perhaps not any) tyrannies in modern history which have dictated such intimate things – at least not that survived long enough to be recorded. That, of course, might be part of the answer. These measures were always presented as temporary. Maybe all those generations of democracy have produced sufficient trust in government for populations to believe their assurances. But there is a darker possibility. The conceit of enlightenment and its sacred values of individual freedom which modern democracies now believe can never be vanquished, which even saw off the communist dictatorships, can collapse into compliant terror – without a shot being fired."
,politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/03/time-discussion-covid-certification/,"As we face our second Easter under Covid restrictions and reflect on those we have lost to this malignant virus, we can take heart that better days are at hand. In the UK, 31 million of us have had our first vaccinations. Positive tests, patients admitted to hospital and, most importantly, deaths from Covid are all falling. But the virus is an implacable enemy against which we must always display discipline and vigilance. A third wave is now driving European Governments to embrace new lockdown measures. Around the world, rates of vaccination are much lower than the UK. While so many remain unvaccinated the virus continues to mutate into new variants which might undo all our good work. Vaccination is a hugely powerful tool, but it can never provide 100 per cent protection. That is why we need to look at every option potentially available to ensure the fastest, safest and most sustainable road back to normality. Which is where   could prove useful. In Israel, which is one of the few countries to have vaccinated a higher percentage of the population than we have in the UK, they have been using a “green pass” to get back to normal more quickly. This green pass system allows citizens who’ve been vaccinated, recently recovered from the virus or who’ve had a recent negative test to congregate in venues which had been closed for months such as theatres and nightclubs. We can expect more countries to adopt similar tools and, indeed, other countries to require our own citizens to provide proof of their Covid status to travel and visit. So it’s imperative that we explore, with friends and allies, how such certificates should work. There are already requirements for health certification to visit some parts of the world – so there are precedents – but we need to proceed with care. If we do accept that Covid certification is going to be required to travel abroad, the question then follows can these certificates help in other ways? If   its citizens’ returns to nightclubs, football stadia and theatres with these certificates, might we? We know that the virus spreads through social contact, and crowded venues which thrive on people mingling – like nightclubs – are the highest risk locations for infection. But the risk of the virus being transmitted in any setting is lower if we reduce the chances of the people there being infectious, because they have received the vaccine, have immunity from recently having had the virus, or have recently had a reliable negative test. Given the hit the night-time economy and the entertainment sector has taken over the last year, anything which might help businesses re-open sooner must be worth considering. That is why the Government proposes to pilot the use of certification criteria in a range of venues this month. Events which would have been closed to the public until much later this year will now be able to admit spectators who’ve been vaccinated or tested. There are, of course, a host of   we have to answer before we can consider a wider roll-out. For health reasons, some people cannot be vaccinated, so we have to ensure access to certification through testing or natural immunity as an alternative. The Israeli approach involves a smartphone app and the NHS app could serve a similar purpose here. But we must not exclude those who do not have a smartphone, so we’re exploring paper-based complements to the app. Privacy and data security must be watertight.   These questions aren’t easy to resolve but I don’t think we can duck them. At the moment, businesses could set up their own private certification schemes and use them to restrict access. Nightclubs and other venues already police entry. Some may well want to embrace any tool available to signal to visitors they are at low risk of infection. So we are looking closely at how we can guarantee fairness. I believe there are some places you should   to access – essential services such as the supermarket, the chemist or the GP surgery. We need to ask where else it would be wrong to require certification. And also consider where certification could, fairly, allow us to relax social distancing faster. That is why I want Telegraph readers and others to keep sharing their views on the way ahead. Certification will be an inevitability for international travel. It could be a valuable aid to opening up our domestic economy and society faster. Unless the Government takes a lead we risk others establishing the rules of the road. So where should the lines be drawn to help protect freedoms, respect privacy, promote equality and get us back to normality? And how can we ensure our approach is proportionate and time-limited? Those are the questions we need to ask in the days ahead - and I know Telegraph readers will help us find common-sense answers.  "

Kill the Bill protesters clash with police at rally addressed by Jeremy Corbyn 
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/03/protesters-clash-police-london-kill-bill-demo-jeremy-corbyn/,"A few hundred Kill the Bill protesters have clashed with police outside parliament after Jeremy Corbyn addressed the crowd. The isolated skirmishes took place in the evening after extra officers were brought in to help unblock the road so a McDonald’s lorry that had turned into Parliament Square could continue on its way through London.  By Saturday evening, the Metropolitan Police said that ""a small minority"" of protesters, who were not social distancing, were still in London's Parliament Square. Arrests were being made after they turned down requests to leave, police said. The Metropolitan Police later said that ten officers had been injured, ""none of these are believed to be serious"", and that 26 people had been arrested for a variety of offences including assault on police and breach of the peace. Earlier, Mr Corbyn, the former Labour Party leader, addressed crowds condemning the introduction of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which will see officers handed more powers. He said the proposed introduction of the news law was a “very dangerous, slippery slope” undermining the right to protest. “If we don’t protest, things don’t change,” he said, which drew cheers and applause from the crowd. Hundreds of people have taken to the streets in towns and cities across England in demonstrations against a crime bill. Cities including Newcastle, Birmingham, Liverpool and Bristol saw thousands of people attend marches despite the lockdown restrictions.  Avon and Somerset Police had to shut off part of the M32 motorway to traffic after protesters sat on the road. The motorway was closed to inbound traffic at junction 3 ""in the interests of safety"", a spokesman said. After a brief closure, the force tweeted: ""The M32 at Junction 3 is now open in both directions. ""Protestors briefly obstructed both carriageways before turning around and marching back into the city centre."" There was a low-key response from Northumbria Police as hundreds of people gathered beneath Grey's Monument in Newcastle. Protesters, including one who held up a placard saying ""we will not be silenced"", cheered as a singer with a guitar performed in opposition to the proposed bill. Demonstrators who marched from the monument through Newcastle city centre chanted: ""Whose streets, our streets."" Many took the knee at the Civic Centre and held a minute's silence for victims of oppression, after which a round of applause broke out. Dorset Police thanked those who took part in ""peaceful protests"" in Bournemouth and Weymouth, and stuck to the Covid-19 restrictions. In the capital protesters, including many who carried anti-sexism placards and chanted ""women scared everywhere, police and Government do not care"", marched past Downing Street. Organisers reminded demonstrators to stay socially distanced as crowds grew to more than 300 in London's Parliament Square, where speeches were made opposite the Houses of Parliament. Several women addressed the crowd and shared personal experiences of suffering abuse and being drugged. In a tweet he posted ahead of the demonstration, Mr Corbyn said the right to fight injustices and to give ""a voice to those often unheard"" is ""once again under threat from a dangerous bill which effectively criminalises peaceful protest"". He said: ""The right to protest is precious. Protest movements make history, from the eight-hour working day to the vote for women to the right for equal pay, the rights we take for granted had to be won through protest. We took them - they weren't handed to us by the rich and powerful."" After hearing from several speakers from various women's rights groups, demonstrators dispersed peacefully just after midday. However, a couple of hundred demonstrators remained in the area and blocked the route for McDonald’s lorry. The Metropolitan Police said: “The majority of people at today’s events in central London have tried to adhere to social distancing and Covid legislation. “A small minority are blocking the road at Parliament Square. Officers are on scene engaging and encouraging them to move so we can reopen the roads.” Demonstrators had gathered in the city centre to show their opposition to the Government's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which will see the police handed new powers to tackle demonstrations."

New 'woke' definition of a museum is Orwellian attempt to rewrite history, MPs warn
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/03/museums-will-pushed-rewrite-history-woke-orwellian-new-definition/,"A proposed ""Orwellian"" change in the international definition of a museum risks putting curators under pressure to rewrite history by “anyone with a political axe to grind”, it has been claimed. A consultation to replace a straightforward 44-word definition of a museum with a more bloated 99-word one by the International Council of Museums closed last week. The final definition will be announced next year, but there are fears that if the present draft is adopted it will turn museums into a new battleground in the culture wars. The change could see prominent museums being forced to rewrite descriptions of treasures under pressure from interest groups. One museum source said: “It will allow anybody with a political axe to grind to put pressure on museums and institutions to follow fashionable political ideologies rather than serve humanity as a whole.” Since 2007 the council's definition has said: “A museum is a non-profit, permanent institution in the service of society and its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purposes of education, study and enjoyment.” However, the new definition proposes: “Museums are democratising, inclusive and polyphonic spaces for critical dialogue about the pasts and the futures. Acknowledging and addressing the conflicts and challenges of the present, they hold artefacts and specimens in trust for society, safeguard diverse memories for future generations and guarantee equal rights and equal access to heritage for all people. “Museums are not for profit. They are participatory and transparent, and work in active partnership with and for diverse communities to collect, preserve, research, interpret, exhibit, and enhance understandings of the world, aiming to contribute to human dignity and social justice, global equality and planetary wellbeing.” There are fears it could lead to renewed calls for the British Government to  . Hartwig Fischer, the director of the  , gave a cautious welcome to the proposed change, saying: “We work in partnership with colleagues and communities across the world to explore and help preserve cultural heritage, to share our collection and invite a global public to engage with its objects. “It is therefore perfectly right that we ask questions of collections: how they were created; how they entered the Museum, and how they help us to understand the world.” He added: “In an increasingly globalized world, where change creates not only opportunities but also challenges and tensions for many people, I believe the museum plays a vital role in helping us to understand our human history in all its complexity and contradiction, in its unity and diversity. “It‘s a unique resource to define our place in the world, providing insight and encouragement, questioning certainties, and inviting us to engage with people from other eras and backgrounds.” However Tory MPs and peers were aghast at the proposal. Tim Loughton MP, chairman of the all party Parliamentary group on the British Museum, told The Telegraph: “Our great museums are next in the firing line for the virtue signalling woke activist nonsense that is engulfing so many aspects of society without invitation and without justification. “These new vacuous Orwellian-style definitions that some are now trying to impose on museums have little to do about preserving the past and less still about conserving its treasures. “Instead, if some get their way, they could become virtually empty shrines giving a blank canvas to activist curators to impose their latest politically correct interpretations of where we have come from, where it all went wrong and where we must go in the future to be virtuous citizens. “The great beauty of museums is as places to protect, explain and promote the remains of the past, inspire as wide an audience as possible to take an interest in the achievements of our ancestors and the ascent of man, warts and all, and to think for ourselves what we can learn from them.” Lord Cormack, the president of the all party group on arts and heritage, said: “The 2007 definition is precise, concise, and accurate. The proposed gobbledegook is wokery at its most cringingly verbose; an attempt to subvert – and pervert – scholarship with doctrine.” Tory MP Peter Bottomley, a member of the arts and heritage group, added: “The new definition subtracts from understanding rather than adds to it.” The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport declined to comment. A department source said: “This is independent of DCMS and we haven't contributed and it wouldn't affect government policy or our expectations of our sponsored museums."""

Matt Hancock summoned to High Court to justify opening shops before pubs
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/03/matt-hancock-summoned-high-court-justify-keeping-pubs-closed/,"Matt Hancock has been ordered to the High Court on Tuesday to justify why he is  . The legal action has been brought by nightclubs operator Sacha Lord and former Pizza Express boss Hugh Osmond to try to force the early opening of hospitality venues. According to High Court documents seen by   the pair are challenging “the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Steps) (England) Regulations 2021 to the extent that those Regulations provide for non-essential retail businesses to reopen before indoor hospitality businesses”. The order from Mr Justice Swift says that ""the Secretary of State shall by 10am on Tuesday April 6 2021 file and serve his response to the application"" from the pair. Although Mr Hancock has been summoned to the High Court, it is likely that officials in his department will have to attend court on his behalf.  , Mr Osmond said it “makes no sense to open indoor ‘non-essential’ retailers five weeks before indoor hospitality”. Non-essential retailers such as clothes shops, homeware stores, betting shops, auction houses, technology shops, car showrooms and market stalls can open from April 12. Indoor hospitality businesses have to wait until May 17. Mr Osmond said the case offered “some hope this weekend for those of us who cherish British freedom and who crave a return to rational and democratic governing”.  He added: “In a democracy, evidence and rationality should still matter, and so too should transparency, challenge and accountability.  “Government has been given an easy ride in Parliament with the official Opposition being nowhere to be seen.   “This has led to arbitrariness, randomness and a complete lack of logic in the rules, and we’re starting to see it being accompanied by something even more sinister: an arrogance, and a sense that ministers are above scrutiny.    “The Government left us no choice but to take it to court and regardless of the eventual outcome of the case, I am grateful to Mr Justice Swift (whose name seems so apt) for recognising that this is a truly urgent matter affecting the lives of millions of people, that simply cannot wait.”  A Government spokesperson said it could not comment on legal proceedings. She added: “As the Prime Minister has said, we want this lockdown to be the last. Our roadmap sets out a phased approach to cautiously easing restrictions, informed by scientific experts, and we continue to act in response to the latest available evidence to protect the NHS and save lives. “We have continued to support the hospitality sector throughout the pandemic, including our new £5 billion Restart Grant scheme, extending the furlough scheme and the VAT cut, and providing 750,000 businesses in hospitality and other sectors with business rates relief.”"

Nursery teachers should give lessons on white privilege, says guidance
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/03/nursery-teachers-should-give-lessons-white-privilege-says-guidance/,"Playgroup teachers need an ""understanding about white privilege"" so toddlers can learn to ""recognise racist behaviours and develop anti-racist views"", according to new guidance. The new advice, drawn up as an alternative to the Government's statutory guidance by representatives from unions and charities, said it was “time to challenge the widespread notion that ‘children do not see race’ and are colour blind to difference”. It states that ""children's racial prejudice"" is at risk of being ""maintained or reinforced"" unless teachers had specialist training to develop an ""understanding about white privilege, systemic racism and how racism affects children and families in early years settings”. On Saturday it was criticised by Conservative MPs for being the ""wrong way to go about"" combating racism as it risked early years learning ""becoming some kind of political Soviet indoctrination session"". It came a day after an   found that factors such as family structure, class, socio-economic background, geography, culture and religion had ""more significant impact on life chances than the existence of racism"". The new 128-page guidance – titled Birth to 5 Matters from the Early Years Coalition – was developed over the past six months by a 18-strong steering group including representatives from the National Education Union, the National Day Nurseries Association and the Association for Professional Development in Early Years. Birth to 5 Matters is seen as an alternative to the Government's non-statutory guidance on the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), titled Development Matters, which comes into effect in September. The official government guidance requires five-year-old children to “know some similarities and differences between different religious and cultural communities in this country, drawing on their experiences and what has been read in class”. However, Birth to 5 Matters goes further, advising staff that ""talking about race is a first step in countering racism. It is a mistaken assumption that treating all people in the same way and ignoring differences in race is a sufficient response to racism. “This approach simply allows the continuation of bias in society which disadvantages people from black and minoritised groups. Instead of a colour-blind approach to race, more proactive anti-racism is needed. “Practitioner training is an important step toward opening dialogue and developing understanding about white privilege, systemic racism, and how racism affects children and families in early years settings. “It is also time to challenge the widespread notion that 'children do not see race' and are colour blind to difference. “When adults are silent about race, children’s racial prejudice and misconceptions can be maintained or reinforced. “Encouraging dialogue and conversation about difference can evoke children’s strong sense of fairness and break down false assumptions about everyone being able to succeed on their merits, so that children recognise racist behaviours and develop anti-racist views.” Robert Halfon, the chairman of the House of Commons Education select committee, said: “This is just unacceptable. This dogma and doctrine is totally out of place. We have all got to combat racism but this is the absolute wrong way to go about it, and insults white working class people from disadvantaged backgrounds. “The whole purpose of children learning is to learn, not for some kind of political Soviet indoctrination session.” Sir John Hayes, the chairman of the Common Sense Group of Tory MPs, said: “Most parents would be horrified by the idea that their toddlers are going to be lectured about how privileged or underprivileged they were depending on their race. “If you tell some children they are privileged you have to by definition tell some others that they are not, that they are somehow disadvantaged or underprivileged. It is really destructive to the welfare of children.” On Saturday Beatrice Merrick, chairman of the Early Years Coalition, told The Telegraph that Birth to 5 Matters “includes a section on equalities to support practitioners in understanding how their legal duties under the EYFS and equalities legislation impact on their practice, and issues they need to consider in ensuring all children and families are treated equitably. “There is an increasing understanding of the importance of sensitively addressing these issues from the earliest years, and the guidance, drawn up by 100 practitioners and commented on by hundreds more, has been widely welcome by practitioners.” A Department for Education spokesman said: “Birth to 5 Matters is not government guidance. It has been produced by an independent organisation and it has not been endorsed by the Department.” A department source added: “Ultimately practitioners must assure themselves they are working in line with the EYFS statutory framework, which requires all early years settings to deliver a broad and holistic curriculum which helps children develop their own positive sense of self and learn about and understand our culturally and socially diverse world.” Last December   saying parents and grandparents should be teaching children about “white privilege”. The guidance from Barnardo's, still available online, says: ""If you’re a parent or carer, grandparent or guardian, we’re produced a helpful guide to speaking to children about the subject of ‘white privilege’. ""Teaching your child about the world - about who they are, what they can achieve, how they should treat others, what’s right and what’s wrong is a core part of nurturing. We believe educating children about white privilege is a part of that, and so is talking to them about how to be actively anti-racist."" That came after Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, said that teachers who tell their pupils that white privilege is a fact are breaking the law.    "

Peers to disclose legal fees paid by foreign governments following security concerns
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/03/peers-disclose-legal-fees-paid-foreign-governments-following/,"Peers have been told to disclose legal fees paid by foreign governments after security concerns were raised, putting pressure on MPs to do the same. The reforms – which also cover if their clients are companies controlled by foreign powers – go further than the disclosure requirements on MPs in the House of Commons. Last December the rules were changed to force peers to disclose how much they are paid and the source of the payment if it comes from ""a foreign state” or an organisation which is controlled by another country. However,   and might have clients with links to foreign powers. Now in fresh tightening of the rules, the House of Lords Conduct Committee has decided that there should be no exemptions to the rule after all. A statement said: “The Committee has concluded that the public interest in transparency in this area, which has been raised by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament among other bodies, trumps any duty of confidentiality. “It is therefore proposed that no exemptions to the transparency requirements should be permitted. ""In contrast the rules in the Commons state that MPs who have second jobs as lawyers are required to disclose the names of their clients “unless this would be contrary to any legal or established professional duty of privacy or confidentiality”. In practice this means that confidentiality trumps any requirement to disclose the names of MPs’ clients. The House of Lords moved to act after the Intelligence and Security Committee said in its Russia report that it was ""notable that a number of members of the House of Lords have business interests linked to Russia, or work directly for major Russian companies linked to the Russian state. “These relationships should be carefully scrutinised, given the potential for the Russian state to exploit them."" The Committee added that it recognised the sensitivity of some legal proceedings and so recommended that lawyers should be required to disclose the identity of clients only once the relationship has entered the public domain or they have been paid (wholly or in part) for the work, whichever comes first. The change is expected to be debated by peers after the Easter recess. Peers will be able to vote down the changes if they want. Last year The Telegraph disclosed how one peer – Lord Barker of Battle – was   without declaring the sum to the Lords' authorities. Lord Barker declared his position as ""independent non-executive director of EN+ Group"" in his entry in the House of Lords register of members' interests until February 2019 when he took a leave of absence. The peer said that ""only a very small proportion"" of the £6million he was paid by EN+, which has links to Putin ally Oleg Deripaska, that year related to the first two months of 2019 when he was an active peer. He also said that ""none of my remuneration relates in any way to membership of the House of Lords""."

Exclusive: Covid passports for return to normal life may not be ready for months
",politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/03/exclusive-covid-passports-return-normal-life-may-not-ready-months/,"Covid passports designed to return life to normal in Britain might not be ready until the autumn,   can reveal. Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, will on Monday confirm for the first time that a system is being developed that will allow people to return to  , as well as travelling overseas for holidays. The Government is trying to find a way to prove it is safe for people to gather at crowded events by either presenting proof of being vaccinated, or a recent negative test or being protected with antibodies from having the infection within the last six months. Pubs, restaurants and non-essential retail will still be allowed to open in coming weeks according to the Government’s roadmap as long as they follow Covid-safe guidance.  Michael Gove, who is leading a cross-government consultation on the moral and practical issues presented by Covid certificates, said they could ""allow us to relax social distancing rules more quickly"". But senior government sources warned that the new certification scheme – which will most likely work over a mobile app – would take “months, not weeks” to develop. Another insider said the app, which could also be used to gain entry to bars and nightclubs, is unlikely to be ready before September. One source said: “I don’t expect it to be until much later in the year.” The news came as it emerged that   before allowing family members into their birthday parties under plans drawn up by a Danish company developing an app for the UK Government. A separate “social distancing review” is considering whether vaccine passports could mean that the Government can “safely lift the one metre-plus rule and the working from home guidance”, No 10 said on Saturday.   Mr Gove makes clear there is “a host of practical and ethical questions we have to answer before we can consider a wider rollout”. These include how to treat fairly people who cannot be vaccinated. “We [will] have to ensure access to certification through testing or natural immunity as an alternative,” he says. Mr Gove says he is worried not to “exclude those who do not have a smartphone, so we’re exploring paper-based complements to the app. Privacy and data security must be watertight"". He adds: “These questions aren’t easy to resolve but I don’t think we can duck them… At the moment, businesses could set up their own private certification schemes and use them to restrict access. Nightclubs and other venues already police entry. “Some may well want to embrace any tool available to signal to visitors they are at low risk of infection. So we are looking closely at how we can guarantee fairness.” The news came as Mr Johnson hailed “another milestone in our vaccination programme with over five million people now having had their second jab”. More than half of the over-80s who are most at risk of dying from contracting Covid-19 have now had their second injection of the coronavirus vaccine. The plans for how to manage the release of the lockdown will be put to a meeting of the Cabinet on Monday and then unveiled by a press conference hosted by the Prime Minister in the evening. Covid passports were “expected to be most useful in managing risks where large numbers of people are in close proximity, at mass events such as festivals, sports matches and nightclubs”, No 10 said. They are likely to contain details of either someone’s up-to-date vaccine status, a recent negative Covid test result or proof of natural immunity for 180 days. However, ministers will gather evidence over the next few weeks to assess their “economic and public health impacts” in other settings like pubs and bars. But Mr Gove said: ""I believe there are some places you should never have to demonstrate your Covid status to access - essential services such as the supermarket, the chemist or the GP surgery."" The passports will be trialled at nine different events this month and next month including three football matches at Wembley in London - including the FA Cup Final - the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, a nightclub and comedy club in Liverpool, and a “mass participation run” at Hatfield House in Hertfordshire. Mr Johnson said: “We have made huge strides over the past few months with our vaccine programme and everyone in the country has made huge sacrifices to get us to this stage in our recovery from Covid-19. “We are doing everything we can to enable the reopening of our country so people can return to the events, travel and other things they love as safely as possible, and these reviews will play an important role in allowing this to happen.” The scale of opposition to Covid passports among Tory MPs could mean that the Prime Minister has to rely on Labour votes to get the vaccine passports through the Commons. Senior figures in the whips' office say it is likely that a vote on the floor of the House of Commons will be needed to bring in domestic vaccine passports. One Cabinet minister said that half of the party’s backbenches could vote against the measures. The minister said: “I do not think the majority of the Conservative Party is comfortable in certifying people to go to the pub or the shop or the theatre. “That sounds a little bit East German to me and I don’t think it will carry a majority of the Conservative Party, let alone the Commons.” If Labour votes against Covid passports then the plans could be defeated in the Commons. Last week Sir Keir Starmer, the party’s leader,   to require them to be used in everyday social activities once the pandemic has eased. Mr Johnson will also confirm on Monday that   once international travel is allowed again after May 17. Countries will be ranked by their vaccination programme, the infection rates, the prevalence of variants of concern and countries' access to genomic sequencing. There will be no isolation requirement for travel from countries in the new green category, although pre-departure and post-arrival tests will still be needed. The ""red"" and ""amber"" restrictions would remain as they are now, with the requirement to enter quarantine or self-isolation upon return. Families will be urged to wait until the traffic light list is published at the beginning of next month before booking any overseas holidays. The plans come in on May 17 and countries will only be put on the travel list a week or two before that date."
