California Gov. Gavin Newsom pushes COVID-19 vaccination efforts as cases increase across US,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/california-gov-gavin-newsom-pushes-covid-19-vaccination/story?id=76858713,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom patiently waited for the day that all Californians 50 and older became eligible for a COVID-19 vaccination, and on Thursday he received a dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Newsom told ABC News' Zohreen Shah- in an exclusive interview that he was thrilled to be ""one and done,"" as he recalled the first vaccine administered in Southern California, to nurse Helen Cordova, on Dec. 14. ""Eighteen million doses later, it's finally my turn,"" he said. ""Today we're making it eligible for everyone 50 and over. In two weeks, everybody 16 and over. We have that supply now."" Newsom received his vaccine in hard-hit south Los Angeles to emphasize vaccine equity in a community that's suffered immensely throughout the coronavirus pandemic. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, California has reported more coronavirus cases -- more than 3.57 million -- and virus-related deaths -- 58,269 -- than any other state. In Los Angeles County, residents identifying as Hispanic of Latino have accounted for approximately 53% of COVID-19-related deaths despite accounting for 48.6% of the population. ""This is why all our work has to be focused, mindful of the issue of equity, not just as a platform, not just as a promotion, not just as a promise,"" Newsom said. ""It's tough. It's gritty work. It's hard. It's stubborn. We know that as it relates to the issue of testing. Seven, eight months ago, that was our biggest issue -- equity on testing and access to testing opportunities. Now it's the same with vaccines."" Last month, the CDC issued a report that measured county's vaccine rollouts with regards to ""social vulnerability."" The vulnerability index included several factors, including race, education, poverty level and housing, which the agency noted has also been linked to higher coronavirus rates. The report examined roughly 49 million shots distributed between Dec. 14 and March 1. Of the 48 states surveyed, California ranked 44th when it came to vaccinations among residents in the most socially vulnerable counties. To date, California has delivered nearly 19.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, more than any other state. However, it ranks 30th for vaccines administered per 100,000 people. Newsom also added that getting children back to school will be of critical importance in returning to ""normal,"" especially children in minority communities that have been among the hardest hit during the pandemic. ""We have a unique moral responsibility to address systemically, once and for all, not just as a state, but I expect as a nation,"" he added. As California takes step to ease restrictions, coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths across the state have all declined significantly after peaking earlier this year. Since mid-January, the state's seven-day average of cases has declined by over 94%. But other states have seen surges recently -- two dozen have seen cases increase by at least 10% over the last week while 18 also have seen 10% increases in reported hospital admissions. And cases are increasing elsewhere. In France, for instance, said Newsom, schools and businesses are closing once more because of the virus's mutations and community spread. ""We have to be mindful this disease is not going away. It's not disappeared. It's as virulent. It's as deadly as it's ever been,"" Newsom said. Newsom also addressed the mounting controversy over his handling of the pandemic, which has resulted in an attempted recall election. ""I don't think it advantages the state of California,"" he said. ""Forget the Democratic Party. Forget the current occupant that happens to be the current governor. And so, for me, this is really an assault on California -- California values -- and I hope we can stay united."""

"Fake German heiress taken into US custody, faces deportation",lifestyle,https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/fake-german-heiress-us-custody-faces-deportation-76821010,"NEW YORK -- U.S.   authorities said Thursday they have detained Anna Sorokin, the con artist who passed herself off as a wealthy German heiress and served more than three years behind bars for defrauding New York banks and hotels. Sorokin, who finagled her way into the Manhattan elite using the name Anna Delvey, remained in New Jersey's Bergen County Jail days after she was scheduled to be deported to her native Germany. The 30-year-old was taken into U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody on March 25, agency spokesperson Marcus Johnson told The Associated Press. The delay could mean the one-time darling of New York's social scene is challenging her deportation, which has been in the works since she was         convicted in 2019 on multiple counts of larceny and theft. ICE declined to comment on Sorokin’s   proceedings. Sorokin's attorney also declined to discuss the case. A message seeking comment was left with the German embassy in Washington. Prosecutors said Sorokin falsified records and         defrauded financial institutions and Manhattan celebrities into believing she had a fortune of $67 million (60 million euros) overseas that could cover her high-end clothing and lavish hotel stays. Among other lies, she claimed her father — a former trucker who runs a heating-and-cooling business — was a diplomat or an oil baron. Her ruse included an application for a $22 million loan to fund a private arts club, complete with exhibitions, installations and pop-up shops, prosecutors said. She was denied that loan but persuaded one bank to lend her $100,000 that she failed to repay. In all, prosecutors accused her of stealing some $275,000. Sorokin, who became known as the “Soho Grifter,” was sentenced to four to 12 years in prison after a trial that drew international media attention. She         was released from prison in February. In a recent interview with the BBC, she suggested her audacious fraud had paid off, noting she is writing a book and working on several other projects. “I am trying to turn the attention I am getting into something positive,” she said. ——— Associated Press writer Michael R.

Blinken swipes at Trump administration in unveiling human rights report,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/blinken-swipes-trump-administration-unveiling-human-rights-report/story?id=76770342,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken repudiated the Trump administration's approach to human rights, with his most direct condemnation of his predecessor yet. Blinken launched the department's 45th annual human rights report Tuesday -- the gold standard in documenting abuses and atrocities in nearly 200 countries and territories around the world. The report, which covers 2020, found a further deterioration for human rights in many countries, particularly as governments used the   pandemic to curb their citizens' rights. The first report under the Biden administration also   that eliminated   of the Trump years, like ending former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's ""hierarchy"" of rights and re-introducing a section on women's reproductive rights that will be published later this year. When human rights defenders ""come under attack, they often look to the United States to speak up on their behalf. Too often in recent years, these defenders heard only silence from us,"" Blinken said. ""We are back for those brave advocates as well. We will not be silent."" In particular, Blinken ""decisively"" repudiated Pompeo's ""Unalienable Rights Commission,"" a panel of academics that said in a report last July that freedom of religion and right to property were the most important human rights. While Pompeo touted the report and said it would lay a foundation for future administrations, critics accused it of minimizing minority rights. Blinken essentially jettisoned the report, saying Tuesday, ""There is no hierarchy that makes some rights more important than others. Past unbalanced statements that suggest such a hierarchy, including those offered by a recently disbanded State Department advisory committee, do not represent a guiding document for this administration."" Human rights are increasingly under threat around the world, Blinken said, saying the trendlines ""are in the wrong direction."" In particular, he highlighted what he called the Chinese   of Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang province, attacks on civil society and   in Russia, Uganda and Venezuela and on pro-democracy protesters in Belarus,   in Yemen, atrocities ""credibly reported"" in Ethiopia's Tigray region, and abuses by the Syria's Bashar al-Assad's regime. While the report doesn't touch on Myanmar's coup and the military's bloody  , because they happened in 2021, Blinken took time to again condemn the events. But after weeks of steadily increasing U.S. sanctions that have not deterred the ruling junta, he had no specific answer on what else the U.S. could do to change the darkening trajectory there. Blinken also leaned into America's own human rights issues, particularly the moment of racial reckoning in the last year. Chinese officials and state-run outlets   U.S. race relations to say American officials are in no position to criticize Beijing -- comparing Uighur slave labor in Xinjiang to Black slaves in the U.S. South. ""We know we have work to do at home. That includes addressing profound inequities, including systemic racism. We don't pretend these problems don't exist. ... We deal with them in the daylight with full transparency, and in fact, that's exactly what separates our democracy and autocracies,"" he said, adding that open reckoning gives the U.S. ""greater legitimacy"" to address other countries' records, too. The Biden administration will use all tools available to impose consequences on human rights abusers and encourage better behavior, Blinken said,   Khashoggi policy that imposes visa restrictions on officials that target or harass their countries' dissidents. ""Standing up for human rights everywhere is in America's interests, and the Biden-Harris administration will stand against human rights abuses wherever they occur, regardless of whether the perpetrators are adversaries or partners,"" he said."

Civil rights groups sue Georgia over new voting law,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/civil-rights-group-sue-georgia-voting-law/story?id=76775186,"Civil rights groups on Tuesday said they have sued the state of Georgia over   enacted last week that they said   for all Georgia  , particularly people of color. In a joint press release Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Southern Poverty Law Center and law firms in the state said that the law was a direct response to the 2020 presidential   and Senate runoff election, where the state had   and Democrats won the state. The groups are suing in federal court on behalf of a church and other community groups. ""The elections were celebrated not just for their turnout, but also for their integrity, with Georgia officials praising them as safe and secure,"" the release said. ""But rather than act to expand participation in the political process, Georgia leaders responded by doing what they have done many times in the state's history: they placed burdensome, unjustified, and unnecessary restrictions on voters, particularly voters of color and other historically disenfranchised communities."" Sophia Lakin, deputy director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, pinned the motives of the law on race. ""This law is driven by blatant racism, represents politics at its very worst, and is clearly illegal,"" Lakin said in the statement. ""We urge the court to act swiftly to strike it down."" Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp defended the law from criticism last week, saying that critics -- including President Joe Biden -- hadn't read the law. ""This bill expands voting access, streamlines vote-counting procedures, and ensures election integrity,"" Kemp said in a tweeted statement. There is nothing 'Jim Crow' about requiring a photo or state-issued ID to vote by absentee ballot -- every Georgia voter must already do so when voting in-person."" Biden   an ""atrocity"" when speaking to reporters last week. In a statement Friday, he likened it to ""Jim Crow"" laws and called on Congress to pass a Democratic-supported federal measure to protect voting rights. ""This is Jim Crow in the 21st Century. It must end. We have a moral and Constitutional obligation to act. I once again urge Congress to pass the For the People Act and the   Voting Rights Advancement Act to make it easier for all eligible Americans access the ballot box and prevent attacks on the sacred right to vote,"" he said in the statement. Prominent Georgia voting rights activist and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams released a statement about the law shortly after it was passed last week. ""Every business, political, and civic leader must stand up and make their opposition to these desperate anti-democratic laws clear,"" Abrams said. ""At a time when Georgia ranks as the worst state for COVID vaccination rates, Georgia Republicans instead are singularly focused on reviving Georgia's dark past of racist voting laws."""
1st news media allowed inside overcrowded migrant facility under Biden ,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/1st-news-media-allowed-inside-overcrowded-migrant-facility/story?id=76768789,"The Biden administration for the first time on Tuesday allowed news media inside a Customs and Border Protection facility facing unprecedented overcrowding due to the recent surge of migrant children and families. A growing backlog inflamed by the coronavirus pandemic has caused delays for the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency responsible for housing children after they are apprehended by Border Patrol. Representatives from the press were allowed inside a temporary tent facility in Donna, Texas, which was meant to hold 250 migrants but had a population of more than 4,100 as of Tuesday. Of those, 3,400 were unaccompanied minors and more than 2,000 have waited beyond the legal limit of 72 hours, according to Customs and Border Protection. The video shows children and families packed into tight living quarters, sleeping on gray camping mats with mylar blankets for warmth. In transparent, plastic pods there is hardly room to walk with young children crammed shoulder to shoulder. Journalists also saw a fenced in recreation area where two groups of boys were playing soccer, agents in dark sunglasses watching over them. The facility spans 184,000 square feet and requires a staff of more than 500 agents. It takes $16 million per month to run the facility. ""As I have said repeatedly, a Border Patrol facility is no place for a child,"" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement Tuesday. ""We have been working around the clock, in coordination with HHS, to quickly move unaccompanied children out of these crowded Border Patrol stations and into the care of HHS so they can be placed with family members or other sponsors."" Earlier Tuesday morning, U.S. Border Patrol took a small group of journalists along dirt roads near the borderline, where they observed the arrest of migrants who had surrendered to authorities prior to their likely transfer to the Donna processing center. All unaccompanied children who are apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley are brought to the Donna facility where they receive a health screening and wait to be transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. CBP also takes temperatures as they arrive and refers them to additional health checks if they have a fever. Acting Executive Officer for Rio Grande Valley Operational Programs Division Oscar Escamilla showed reporters through the facility on Tuesday. ""Yes we are officers. Yes we enforce the   laws,"" Escamilla said. ""But when you have kids involved, we have to take care of these kids. This is not the right place for these kids."" Escamilla said children are offered the opportunity to call family members at least once every 48 hours while they are in the facility. The new administration took swift actions right from the start to reverse several immigration policies of the Trump era. While the new White House has come under fire for pulling back hard-line restrictions before it was fully prepared to handle the current surge of migrants, some remain in place. Biden administration officials are quick to point out one major departure from Trump’s pandemic-era immigration restrictions: the treatment of unaccompanied migrant children. When the Trump administration invoked a section of the public health code known as ""Title 42"" it gave immigration authorities the green light to start rapidly removing unaccompanied migrant children. Mostly in their teens, kids at the time were sent back to Mexico sometimes within a matter of hours. Customs and Border Protection said it was necessary to reduce overcrowding at its facilities. Legal advocates for immigrants have decried the use of Title 42 as illegal and unnecessarily cruel. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has taken on the responsibility of processing and caring for children who arrive at the border without a parent or guardian. The change, combined with an unprecedented increase in the number of kids found crossing the border, has strained government resources and sent the Biden administration scrambling to find more shelter space. Federal officials have enlisted convention centers in California and Texas, and even co-opted a NASA site for the mass housing effort. The difference in the application of the Title 42 so-called health mandates is also seen with migrant families who cross the border. Thousands have been turned back or ""expelled"" under the Biden administration, but the majority in recent weeks have remained in the U.S. for traditional immigration processing. Last February, nearly 20,000 migrant families were stopped at the border by U.S. immigration authorities. Of those, nearly 8,000 were rapidly ""expelled"" under Title 42. U.S. officials have said immigration officials on the other side of the border, in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, have refused to accept families with children under the age of 7."
SolarWinds cyberhack gained access to then-acting DHS chief's emails: Sources,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/solarwinds-cyberhack-gained-access-acting-dhs-chiefs-emails/story?id=76766289,"Authorities believe that the massive   allegedly carried out by Russia last year successfully breached the email accounts of then-DHS acting secretary Chad Wolf and dozens of other officials at the Department of Homeland Security, three sources familiar with the matter told ABC News. In fact, the email accounts of top officials at Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency -- the very DHS agency charged with fighting cyber threats -- may have been compromised by the cyberattack, according to one former government official familiar with the matter. In a statement, DHS acknowledges a ""small number"" of employees accounts were targeted in the breach, but there are no indicators that their networks are compromised as of now. ""A widespread intrusion campaign targeted many federal government and private sector entities, including DHS,"" according to a DHS spokesperson. ""Upon learning about the campaign, the Department took immediate steps to respond to the incident, including leveraging response teams from CISA and private sector partners, to continue executing its mission,"" the spokesperson said. ""However, this widespread intrusion campaign has again shown that our strategic adversaries are sophisticated, persistent, and have increasing capabilities.” The massive hack, discovered in December, affected nine federal agencies, according to Deputy National Security Adviser for cyber Anne Neuberger. Those responsible were ""likely of Russian origin,"" that the hack was ""launched from inside the United States” and that it could take ""several months"" to complete the investigation, she said at a press briefing in February. The administration has yet to outline what exactly their response will be to the hack. FBI Director Chris Wray, asked earlier this month by Senate Judiciary Chairman Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., what the U.S. government's response should be to the SolarWinds hack, said he didn't want to answer specifically because ""discussing the response in any detail is probably something that would be better done in a classified setting. That by itself might give you a little bit of a hint."" Wray said more generally that coming back from the SolarWinds hack would be a ""long, hard slog,"" even using the strategy that has been most effective for the U.S. in the past regarding countering cyber adversaries."
Can I still spread the coronavirus after I'm vaccinated?,lifestyle,https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/spread-coronavirus-vaccinated-76806052,"NEW YORK -- Can I still spread the   after I’m vaccinated? It’s possible. Experts say the risk is low, but are still studying how well the shots blunt the spread of the virus. The current   are highly effective at preventing people from getting seriously sick with COVID-19. But even if vaccinated people don’t get sick, they might still get infected without showing any symptoms. Experts think the vaccine would also curb the chances of those people spreading the virus. “A vaccinated person controls the virus better, so the chances of transmitting will be greatly reduced,” said Dr. Robert Gallo a virus expert at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Among the evidence so far: Studies suggesting if people do get infected despite vaccination, they harbor less coronavirus in the nose than the unvaccinated. That makes it harder to spread. Trying to settle the question, the U.S. is starting a study of college students willing to undergo daily nasal swab testing. Given the uncertainty and the arrival of more contagious variants, experts say fully vaccinated people should continue to wear masks and social distance in public and when visiting with unvaccinated people at high risk for severe illness if infected. “We still have to be cautious,” Gallo said. “The vaccine is essential. But it is not a cure-all that ends the epidemic tomorrow.” Other factors can also affect the likelihood of a vaccinated person spreading the virus, including vaccination rates in the community and whether there’s an ongoing surge in cases locally. “We want to think it’s all or none, but it’s very situation-specific,” said Dr. Laraine Lynn Washer, an infectious disease expert at the University of Michigan. —— The AP is answering your questions about the coronavirus in         this series.

Vaccine passport efforts draw opposition from GOP lawmakers,lifestyle,https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/vaccine-passport-efforts-draw-opposition-gop-lawmakers-76852995,"HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Vaccine passports being developed to verify COVID-19 immunization status and allow inoculated people to more freely travel, shop and dine have become the latest flash point in America’s perpetual political wars, with Republicans portraying them as a heavy-handed intrusion into personal freedom and private   choices. They currently exist in only one state — a limited government partnership in New York with a private company — but that hasn’t stopped GOP lawmakers in a handful of states from rushing out legislative proposals to ban their use. The argument over whether passports are a sensible response to the pandemic or governmental overreach echoes the bitter disputes over the past year about masks, shutdown orders and even the   themselves. Vaccine passports are typically an app with a code that verifies whether someone has been vaccinated or recently tested negative for COVID-19. They are in use in         Israel  and under development in parts of Europe, seen as a way to safely help rebuild the pandemic-         devastated travel industry. They are intended to allow businesses to more safely open up as the vaccine drive gains momentum, and they mirror measures already in place for schools and overseas travel that require proof of immunization against various diseases. But lawmakers around the country are already taking a stand against the idea. GOP senators in Pennsylvania are drawing up legislation that would prohibit vaccine passports, also known as   certificates or travel passes, from being used to bar people from routine activities. “We have constitutional rights and health privacy laws for a reason,” said Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff, a Republican. “They should not cease to exist in a time of crisis. These passports may start with COVID-19, but where will they end?” Benninghoff said this week his concern was “using taxpayer money to generate a system that will now be, possibly, in the hands of mega-tech organizations who’ve already had problems with getting hacked and security issues.” A Democratic colleague, Rep. Chris Rabb of Philadelphia, sees value in vaccine passports if they are implemented carefully. “There’s a role for using technology and other means to confirm people’s statuses,” Rabb said. “But we do have concerns around privacy, surveillance and inequitable access.” Republican legislators in other states have also been drafting proposals to ban or limit them. A bill introduced in the Arkansas Legislature on Wednesday would prevent government officials from requiring vaccine passports for any reason, and would ban their use as a condition of “entry, travel, education, employment or services.” The sponsor, Republican state Sen. Trent Garner, called vaccine passports “just another example of the Biden administration using COVID-19 to put regulations or restrictions on everyday Americans.” President Joe Biden's administration has largely taken a hands-off approach on vaccine passports. At a news conference this week, Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he considered them a project for the private sector, not the government. He said the government is considering federal guidelines to steer the process surrounding vaccine passports. Among its concerns: Not everyone who would need a passport has a smartphone; passports should be free and in multiple languages; and private health information must be protected. ""There will be organizations that want to use these. There will be organizations that don’t want to use these,” said Dr. Brian Anderson of Mitre, which operates federally funded research centers and is part of a coalition working to develop standards for vaccine certifications to make their use easier across vendors. Anderson noted the Vaccination Credential Initiative is not making recommendations on how — or even if — organizations choose to use the certifications. In Montana, GOP lawmakers this week voted along party lines to advance a pair of bills that would ban discrimination based on vaccine status or possession of an immunity passport, and to prohibit using vaccine status or passports to obtain certain benefits and services. And a freshman Republican state lawmaker in Ohio spoke out about the concept, saying more restrictions or mandates are not the answer to every COVID-19 problem. “Ohioans are encouraged to take the COVID-19 vaccine for the health and well-being of themselves and others,” Rep. Al Cutrona said. “However, a vaccine should not be mandated or required by our government for our people to integrate back to a sense of normalcy.” Republican Florida Gov. Ron         DeSantis on Friday issued an executive order that said no governmental entity can issue a vaccine passport, and businesses in that state can't require them. He said he expected the Legislature to pass a similar law. His order said requiring ""so-called COVID-19 vaccine passports for taking part in everyday life — such as attending a sporting event, patronizing a restaurant, or going to a movie theater — would create two classes of citizens.” U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, a newly elected member who has embraced and promoted a range of far-right political positions, told her supporters on Facebook earlier this week that “something called a vaccine passport” was a form of “corporate communism” and part of a Democratic effort to control people’s lives. And a GOP lawmaker in Louisiana has teed up a bill to keep the state from including any vaccination information on the Louisiana driver’s license or to make issuance of a driver’s license subject to vaccine status. In         New York, a government-sponsored vaccine passport called the Excelsior Pass is being introduced. A smartphone app, it shows whether someone has been vaccinated or recently tested negative for COVID-19. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo touted the idea as letting an event venue usher, for example, use their own smartphone to scan a concertgoer’s code. New York officials have not released specific details about how the app will work, access someone’s vaccination or testing status or protect a user’s name, date of birth or the location where their code was scanned. The app’s privacy policy says data will be “maintained in a secure manner” and won’t be used for sales or marketing purposes or shared with a third party. But some privacy experts say the public needs more specifics to ensure its information is protected. Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project at the Urban Justice Center, a New York–based civil rights and privacy group, warned the Excelsior Pass creates a new layer of surveillance without sufficient details about how it collects data or protects privacy. ""We basically only have screenshots of the user interface and not much more,” Cahn said of Excelsior Pass. ——— Associated Press writers Andrew Welsh-Huggins in Columbus, Ohio; Marina Villeneuve in Albany, New York; Candice Choi in New York; Andrew DeMillo in Little Rock, Arkansas; Amy Beth Hanson in Helena, Montana; and Melinda Deslatte in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, contributed."
Biden taps 11 judicial nominees with historic diversity,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-taps-11-judicial-nominees-historic-diversity/story?id=76768724,"President Joe Biden announced Tuesday the nomination of a diverse group of eleven judicial nominees, several of whom he said would make history if confirmed to the bench. “This trailblazing slate of nominees draws from the very best and brightest minds of the American legal profession. Each is deeply qualified and prepared to deliver justice faithfully under our Constitution and impartially to the American people — and together they represent the broad diversity of background, experience, and perspective that makes our nation strong,” Biden said in a statement. One notable choice is U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to take the place of Attorney General Merrick Garland on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

""These nominees consist of attorneys who have excelled in the legal field in a wide range of positions, including as renowned jurists, public defenders, prosecutors, in the private sector, in the military, and as public servants at all levels of government,"" Biden said in his statement. White House press secretary Jen Psaki also touted the group during a press briefing Tuesday. ""This is also a groundbreaking slate in many ways. It includes four nominees who have served as public defenders, four who are members of the [Asian-America Pacific Islander] community, a nominee who, if confirmed, would be the first Muslim American federal judge in history,"" Psaki said. ""Nine of the 11 nominees are women, and overall, this groups represents a paradigm shift in the type of people who can see themselves on the federal bench, while still maintaining the president's absolute highest standards for the qualifications, integrity, and fairness of each individual being considered."" Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is nominated for the D.C. Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. Jackson currently serves as a judge for the District of Columbia U.S. District Court.

The investigation, first reported by The New York Times, began last summer and focuses on whether Gaetz had a sexual relationship with an underage girl and paid for her to travel with him, and whether he violated federal sex trafficking laws, a source aware of the investigation confirmed to ABC News. Gaetz told the Times that his lawyers were informed that he was the subject, not the target, of an investigation. ""I have not had a relationship with a 17-year-old. That is totally false,"" Gaetz told Fox News' Tucker Carlson in an interview Tuesday night. ""That is false and records will bear that out to be false."" The New York Times reported that the inquiry into Gaetz is part of a larger inquiry into Joel Greenberg, a former Florida official indicted last summer on charges that included sex trafficking of a child and financially supporting people in exchange for sex. Greenberg has pleaded not guilty. On Fox News, Gaetz -- who, according to an Axios report earlier on Tuesday, had been telling confidants he was considering retiring from Congress and possibly joining the right-wing media outlet Newsmax -- appeared to confirm the investigation when he said he was approached by someone who claimed he could ""make this investigation go away."" ""There was a demand for money in exchange for a commitment that he could make this investigation go away along with his co-conspirators,"" Gaetz said, identifying the alleged extortionist as former DOJ official David McGee. McGee did not respond to ABC News' request for comment. In an interview with the Washington Post, McGee denied Gaetz's claim that he was part of an extortion effort targeting the Florida congressman. ""It is completely false. It's a blatant attempt to distract from the fact that he's under investigation for sex trafficking of minors,"" McGee told the Post. ""I have no connection with that case at all, other than, one of a thousand people who have heard the rumors."" ""I do believe that there are people at the Department of Justice who are trying to smear me,"" Gaetz said on Fox News. In a statement from his office, Gaetz said he had been cooperating with authorities and that his father ""has even been wearing a wire"" at the FBI's direction ""to catch these criminals"" seeking to extort him for $25 million. Asked in the Fox News interview how long the investigation had been going on, Gaetz said ""I don't know,"" and went on to suggest that someone is alleging there are ""pictures of me with child prostitutes,"" which he claimed was ""obviously false."" At one point during the interview, Gaetz claimed that two years ago he had dinner with Carlson and took along  a ""friend"" who was ""actually threatened by the FBI, told that if she wouldn't cop to the fact that somehow I was involved in some pay-for-play scheme that she could face trouble."" But Carlson promptly denied knowing what Gaetz was talking about, responding: ""I don't remember the woman you're speaking of or the context at all, honestly."" After returning from a commercial break, Carlson called the segment ""one of the weirdest interviews I've ever conducted."""

Biden faces the challenge of highlighting progress without relaxing restrictions,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-faces-challenge-highlighting-progress-relaxing-restrictions/story?id=76769929,"Several Republican governors bucked President Joe Biden's plea to   in place, even as his administration works to increase vaccination rates to   of what would be a fourth surge of the   in the U.S. ""I'm reiterating my call for every governor, mayor and local leader to maintain and reinstate the mask mandate. Please,"" Biden said Monday. ""This is not politics. Reinstate the mandate if you let it down. And businesses should require masks as well. The failure to take this virus seriously -- precisely what got us in this mess in the first place -- risks more cases and more ... deaths."" Biden's call for the American people to continue using masks to stop COVID from surging is nothing new. He has made the plea in nearly all of his remarks on the virus as president, warning that the country is not yet out the woods even as progress is made on vaccinations. Also on Monday, he announced at least 90% of Americans would be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine by April 19, and 90% of the population would have a vaccination site within 5 miles of their homes. But the rollback on restrictions at the state level highlights the competing challenge Biden faces on the pandemic: touting positive signs that hope is on the horizon, while also keeping a country fatigued of COVID-19 regulations and restrictions compliant. White House COVID-19 adviser Andy Slavitt also had a warning for states Tuesday. ""Lifting all of these restrictions, telling people not to wear masks, gathering in large crowds, that's the equivalent of playing with fire."" Despite the administration's dire warnings, Republican leaders moved forward with plans to do away with statewide mandates on masking. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, who last previously extended her state's mask mandate through the end of March, made clear she has no intention of issuing another extension. ""As Gov. Ivey has previously stated, Alabama's mask mandate ends April 9. We have made progress, and we are moving towards personal responsibility and common sense, not endless government mandates,"" Ivey spokeswoman Gina Maiola said in a statement to the Associated Press. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who has also previously extended his state's masking requirement, announced Tuesday his plans to immediately lift the mandate. ""This does not mean that the use of the mask will cease,"" Hutchinson argued, adding that ""common sense should govern"" mask usage and private businesses' decisions on masks should still be respected. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, who recently signed a bill repealing the state's mask mandate starting April 10, also has no plans to reverse course, his office confirmed to ABC News. In her press briefing Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki sidestepped questions about the impact Biden's message was having, arguing that local leaders and businesses could take action even if governors refused to do so. ""It's a tough message, (but) important for people to hear that we're still in war with this virus, and people need to still be vigilant in order to return to normal,"" Psaki said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now seeing an increase in the number of new COVID-19 cases and people hospitalized with the disease, according to CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, caused by increased travel in recent weeks, lifting restrictions and more relaxed behavior. The seven-day average of cases has seen a 10% increase over the previous period and hospitalizations and deaths also have increased. ""I'm going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom,"" Walensky said in an emotional plea at a White House briefing Monday. ""We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are, and so much reason for hope. But right now, I'm scared."""
'Make America become greater': Voters who saved Biden campaign rate early presidency,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/make-america-greater-voters-saved-biden-campaign-rate/story?id=76396185,"CHARLESTON, S.C.  -- After early primary defeats in  ,   and  , Joe Biden staked his bid for the presidency on the voters of South Carolina. They  ; now, many are looking to him to return the favor. ""We've given him what he asked for, so now it is time for us to receive that in return,"" said Quati Woodberry-Gadson of North Charleston. ""Yes,   is an issue, but so is housing, so is health care, so are all of these things that we have been voting for and have been striving to achieve and accomplish."" Biden has surpassed two months in the White House and   returned to the state that helped reinvigorate his faltering 2020 campaign to hear directly from voters about where he is meeting expectations, where he may be missing the mark and their feelings about the direction of the country in the post-Donald Trump era. ""We're still worried about the variants and things like that, but for us it's the hope that we see in the vaccine rolling out,"" said Marybeth Berry, a university professor and mother of two from Columbia, who broadly praised Biden's handling of the pandemic. ""He came in with a plan,"" added retired Army Maj. Christopher Berry, a lifelong Republican, ""and he's letting the medical community -- more or less,   -- be the mouthpiece instead of him getting up in front of everybody trying to convince them what's real and what's not so."" Nationwide, voters of both parties have  of Biden's handling of the pandemic and plan to bolster the economy. But there are signs that many Americans -- including loyal Democrats -- harbor misgivings about the administration's early approach to immigration and gun violence. ""The crisis at the border is very concerning to me,"" said Marybeth Berry, a Democrat who voted for Biden. ""The kids in cages -- I was appalled at that during the Trump administration. ... And now to see it happening even more so with this influx of children at the border, that is concerning."" ""It's not a crisis,"" said Felisha Woodberry, a longtime Sen.   supporter in North Charleston, ""but I feel like they should have had a plan ready to go from day one to put in place for those people who were here and those who were coming."" Mayor Michael Butler of Orangeburg, a heavily African American community that is a must-visit on the road to the White House for Democrats, even volunteered that the southern border situation is a source of disappointment in the new president. ""I know we want to help everyone, but we still have to have standards for people to go through the immigration process,"" Butler said of the administration's approach to a surge in migrants from Central America. Biden won the Democratic primary in South Carolina with 48.6% of the vote, overwhelmingly defeating his next closest competitor, Sanders, who captured just 19.8%. The state's African American voters powered his victory with nearly two-thirds backing the former vice president. ""He's presidential. He's given us someone to look up to and say this is our leader, he and his family,"" said Butler, the first black mayor in Orangeburg history. He initially supported New York City Mayor   in the Democratic primary but now calls Biden a ""savior."" ""We needed someone to take us through the Red Sea and he's the one leading us across,"" he said. ""I would tell him, 'President Biden, continue doing what you're doing; build on principles and things that you've stood for; and make America become greater.'"" While many South Carolina Democrats praised Biden for his decency and measured tone, some told ABC News they are still waiting to see bold action that was promised during the campaign. ""We need to act -- not tomorrow, not a year from now, but today,"" said Lawrence Nathaniel, a once-homeless son of Columbia who founded   South Carolina   of George Floyd in May. ""Right now we're   on the Senate, and making sure that we can get the   passed through,"" Nathaniel said. ""We want the president and vice president to put a little more focus on it and not make it just a ceremonial thing."" Nathaniel, who supported businessman   in the primary, said he's cautiously optimistic Biden shares his urgency for change but is not convinced. ""There are people out here that are still hurting and that need help and need to be sure they can trust you as president of the United States,"" he said of his message to the president. Nina Grey, a 77-year-old retired minister and progressive activist, said she takes Biden at his word but that voters like her need to keep up pressure for action. ""You have to help him by expressing your point of view. I think everybody needs to do that, and we all need to find our citizenship voice and engage,"" Grey said in an interview at her Columbia home. ""I think he can deliver quite a bit."" At Biden's first campaign rally in South Carolina in 2019,   to end longtime support for a ban on federal funding for abortions and he agreed. Her exchange with the candidate, captured on cellphone video, was the first time Biden publicly changed his position on the issue. ""Of course his Catholic faith is against that, but I have also seen him evolve,"" Grey said. Marybeth Berry questioned Biden at a campaign event days before the primary vote in 2020 -- a town hall moment that went viral on social media -- asking the candidate to display more ""fire"" in his approach. Berry said that so far she's getting what she hoped for. ""You know there's always still a little politician stuff that, you know, you sort of wish wouldn't happen, but overall I think that he's -- he seems to be honest, and I mean he's getting things done,"" she said. In North Charleston, where the pandemic and recession have exacerbated financial and education inequality, Felisha Woodberry, an unemployment claims processor and mother of two, said she still  . ""I'm OK with what (Biden is) putting in place,"" Woodberry said. ""Bernie was the person that I felt like had a plan to hit the road. And I feel like with Joe Biden, what's happened more so is that everybody's so concerned with what's happening with COVID and what needs to happen with COVID that everything else is pushed back."" Her daughter, Quati Woodberry-Gadson, is spending her final weeks in college on an internship with local nonprofit  , which is bridging gaps in government support for families. ""Now that the pandemic has hit and is in full swing, it has really highlighted the necessity, as far as what kids are missing and lacking,"" said Woodberry-Gadson, who helps stockpile food, clothing and hygiene products for children at a local school. ""If there was some kind of way that (President Biden) could make it to South Carolina to actually see the disparities and the poverty rate and everything that's needed and necessary, I feel like it would be monumental to my community and to the people who I'm advocating for,"" she said. Biden has not yet returned to South Carolina as president, but has spent extensive time in the state during his career. In 2015, after a white supremacist   at a bible study at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, then-Vice President Biden consoled the victims' families and worshipped with them out of the public spotlight. ""Faith that is not accompanied by action is dead,"" said  , who's wife Myra was among those killed in the church shooting. ""In Biden, faith is certainly not dead."" ""He just passed the   into law, and that's faith,"" Thompson added, ""because he's answering the needs of the people."" Thompson and his son, Anthony Thompson, Jr., said they were deeply moved by Biden's compassion after the massacre and are convinced he has the ability to bridge political divides. ""When we talk about criminal justice reform, you know, I think these are areas that are important to particularly the African American community,"" Thompson, Jr., said. ""And so for him coming out already for addressing those issues, I think that's very important and speaks to his leadership."" Days before the Thompsons spoke with ABC News, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a   that would strengthen gun-safety regulations and close the so-called Charleston background check loophole. The measure faces strong opposition from Republicans in the Senate. ""When they were checking   record, if they had just a lot more days, then my wife would still be here,"" the reverend said of the man who killed his wife with a gun obtained after a delay in his background check. ""One day it could be your family. Maybe your child, your wife, your best friend. You know, you just don't know how I feel, until it happens to you,"" he said. ""So why wait for it to happen to you or anybody close to you before you decide to do something about it."" As he reflected on divisions in American society and the challenges ahead in Biden's presidency, Thompson -- who has   his wife's killer -- said his prayer is that the idea of forgiveness will spread within our politics. ""People are trying to find a way to get peace from their burdens, and they just don't know how to do it, what to do. They think anger is going to be the thing to do it; revenge will be the thing to do it; but it never happens, just gets worse. That's what's happened to our country,"" Thompson said. ""We as people, as a nation, have to get past all the things that happened in the past, like slavery, like racism, discrimination, segregation. You got to begin in your family. Your family takes it, and it just spreads."""

 'Targeted violence' against schools preventable: Secret Service report,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/targeted-violence-schools-preventable-secret-service-report/story?id=76755511,"Targeted violence against schools is preventable, if the warning signs are identified, according to a new report by the Secret Service released Tuesday. The report by the Secret Service's National Threat Assessment Center studied 67 thwarted school violence plots and 100 plotters to come up with a framework to further  . The agency found that there were   in attacks that were prevented and attacks that happened, such as a history of discipline or law enforcement interaction, if the plotter had experienced bullying or had underlying mental health issues, intended to commit suicide or had been impacted by childhood conditions. Schools should intervene as quickly as possible, according to the Secret Service. Dr. Lina Althari, director of the Secret Service's National Threat Assessment Center, told ABC News that identifying warning signs of a student who could potentially carry out a mass attack is crucial in getting the student help. ""We want to make sure that we are identifying these kids before it gets to the level where they are engaging in criminal actions, and then face legal consequences for that,"" she said. ""We want to make sure we're catching them early on when maybe they are becoming more depressed, they are becoming more suicidal."" The Secret Service found that 45% of the attacks planned, but not carried out, were based on a grievance with a classmate. It also found that 15% of potential attackers wanted to kill. For example, according to authorities Matthew Vanderbeek threatened to shoot up his graduation ceremony in 2018. Vanderbeek wanted to emulate the 2012 Aurora, Colorado,   that killed 12, according to the Secret Service, even going so far as dyeing his hair to match that of the convicted gunman and advocating for his release from prison. Students are best positioned to report any concerning behavior of a classmate, the report said, but families are critical to identifying troubling behavior. In the foiled plots studied by the Secret Service, 69% of the communications about the plans were observed by students, classmates or peers. Often times, when reported early, student plotters are able to seek treatment rather than criminal prosecution, Althari said. ""Sometimes we know parents can be in denial,"" Althari said. ""But if it is swiftly explained to them what the goal of this process is which is about helping that student have successful outcomes in life."" The report also found that 64% of the student attack plotters had access to firearms and 15 of the foiled plots were set to be conducted on dates in April -- likely because of the Columbine High School shooting, which occurred on  . The Secret Service found that in nearly half of the planned plots, one or more of the co-conspirators had interest in the 1998 shooting at Columbine. And of the school attackers who planned but did not carry out the attack, 85% either researched how to obtain or obtained weapons. And in nearly all of the attacks, the plotter planned to use firearms in the attack itself and 51% had planned to use explosives. The report indicated that 75% of the plotters were discovered because they communicated their intent and most behaviors were observed and reported on the same day. In one instance, a 17-year-old male was reported to police by a friend after he indicated he wanted to carry out a school shooting. ""The plotter created cellphone videos in which he discussed his plot, stating he would kill more people than Columbine, Virginia Tech or the attack in Oslo, Norway,"" the report says. ""The plotter spoke about purchasing an AK-17 with a laser sight, told him that he perfected a timer for bombs and showed him a map of schools."" A majority of the plotters were also male, which is consistent with previous Secret Service research on mass attacks."
Biden's 'Jobs Cabinet' to sell infrastructure as GOP resists,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/bidens-jobs-cabinet-sell-infrastructure-gop-resists-76821672,"WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden set about convincing America it needs his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan on Thursday, deputizing a five-member “jobs Cabinet” to help in the effort. But the enormity of his task was clear as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's vowed to oppose the plan “every step of the way.” Speaking in Kentucky, McConnell said he personally likes Biden and they’ve been friends a long time. But the president will get no cooperation from the GOP, which objects to the corporate tax increases in the plan and says they would hurt America's ability to compete in a global economy. “We have some big philosophical differences, and that’s going to make it more and more         difficult for us to reach bipartisan agreements,"" the Republican leader said. White House chief of staff Ron Klain said the key to any outreach is that the proposal’s ideas are already popular. Americans want smooth roads, safe bridges, reliable public transit, electric vehicles, drinkable water, new schools and investments in manufacturing,         among the plan's many components, he said. “We kind of think it’s just right,"" Klain said in a televised interview with the news organization Politico. ""But we’re happy to have a conversation with people, less about the price tag, more about what are the elements that should be in the plan that people think are missing.” Those conversations could be limited to Democrats as McConnell declared: “I’m going to fight them every step of the way."" Biden told his Cabinet at its first meeting that he is enlisting several of them to help with the push: Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. “Working with my team here at the White House, each Cabinet member will represent me in dealings with Congress, engage the public in selling the plan and help organize the details as we refine it and move forward,"" Biden said. The task will involve lots of salesmanship for a legacy-making piece of legislation that Biden announced in a Wednesday speech. His administration must sway Congress. It needs to rally voters. It’s also looking to outside economists to back the plan. It’s monitoring Wall Street for any celebrations or jitters. It’s forming alliances with advocates, while dealing with critics of the plan's corporate tax hikes and project details. And Biden's administration also intends, per the plan, to cajole other nations to stop slashing their own tax rates in what has been a race-to-the-bottom to attract and retain multinational businesses. Biden's vehicle for financing his infrastructure plans is a key dividing line. Republicans object to raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, one of the many changes so that business   would fund infrastructure. Republicans had cut the corporate rate from 35% in 2017, a hallmark policy achievement of  's presidency. Within Washington and corporate board rooms, the administration is attracting its share of accolades and rebukes on his proposal. In Biden's own party, liberal Democrats in Congress want him to go bigger. And Democrats representing high-tax states want to remove a 2017 tax code change that limited deductions of state and local taxes for individuals. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed no qualms about the proposal's scope. “It was in the tradition of America -- to think big,” Pelosi said at a press conference Thursday. “And now, in this century, President Biden is undertaking something in the tradition of thinking big, being transformational and creating jobs for America.” While many leading business groups oppose the higher taxes, some major companies see reason for optimism because of the innovations that would be encouraged by the plan. Automakers Ford, General Motors and Toyota endorsed the general concepts of Biden’s plan, which calls for the construction of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 in what would be a shift away from gasoline-powered cars. But some environmentalists said the plan's shift away from fossil fuels that cause climate change was not substantial enough. “Biden has pledged to cut carbon emissions 50% and decarbonize our electricity sector, but this proposal won’t even come close,"" said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. The White House was quick to address the climate change concerns. Climate adviser Gina McCarthy said the administration expects the infrastructure package to include Biden’s pledge to set a national standard requiring utilities to produce 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The proposed electricity standard “is going to be fairly robust, and it’s going to be inclusive,’’ McCarthy said. “I think we can get to the results that we’re looking for in a number of different ways. If a clean energy standard can be done, we think it should be done.’’ For every criticism of the plan's details, there were also plaudits for its broader approach. Harvard University economist Larry Summers, a former treasury secretary, endorsed Biden's plan, after previously criticizing the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan because of its size and debt-based financing. He downplayed any risks from corporate tax hikes, since low interest rates mean the costs of obtaining capital are already low for many companies. “I am excited,” Summers said on Twitter. “The economy's capacity will go up.” The plan also carries a political dimension as organized labor is mobilizing to get the package passed, an important push given the steady recent Republican gains among working class voters. Biden's plan, with its focus on construction and manufacturing jobs, has the potential to reverse some of that slide — and the unions that backed him in 2020 are promising to help deliver votes on infrastructure. “Our members are an army a half-million strong, that will make calls, visit members of Congress and rally for good jobs building our nation’s infrastructure,"" said Terry O’Sullivan, general president of Laborers International Union of North America, one of the largest construction trades unions. ""We did it with boots on the ground to get President Biden elected.” ——— AP reporters Darlene Superville, Matthew Daly and Tom Krisher contributed to this report."
George Soros to give $500M to Bard College in New York,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/george-soros-give-500m-bard-college-york-76821691,"NEW YORK -- Billionaire philanthropist   has committed $500 million to a private liberal arts college in New York, which the school called a “transformational” gift that would be among the largest ever given to higher education in the United States. “This is the most historic moment since the college’s founding in 1860,” Bard College President Leon Botstein said Thursday in the announcement. In addition to the pledge from the 90-year-old investor, the school announced it raised $250 million for its endowment and plans to raise another $250 million over the next five years. The money will establish a new $1 billion endowment that will support ""the college’s full array of student financial aid, faculty, and program,” the school said, adding it will also “enable the college to sustain its mission and to grow its international profile.” Soros said in the announcement Thursday that “Bard has had an outsized impact, setting the standard in liberal arts education in prisons, in high school age students, and in the arts and in its international work.” Last year, the investor announced he would give $1 billion to establish the Open Society University Network to integrate teaching and research across higher education institutions worldwide, a plan Soros called the “most important and most enduring project” of his life. Bard College, located about 90 miles north of New York City, is one of the founding partners of the network along with Soros’         Central European University in Austria. —- The Associated Press receives support from the Lilly Endowment for coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits.

Travel rebound: United plans to hire about 300 new pilots,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/travel-rebound-united-plans-hire-300-pilots-76821840,"CHICAGO -- United Airlines said Thursday it plans to hire about 300 pilots, another sign that   feel more confident that a recent increase in travel will continue. The airline plans to start by hiring pilots who received conditional job offers or had a class for new hires canceled last year, when the industry was slammed by the   pandemic. “With vaccination rates increasing and travel demand trending upwards, I’m excited to share that United will resume the pilot hiring process that was halted last year,” Bryan Quigley, Chicago-based United’s senior vice president of flight operations, told employees. Nearly 1,000 United pilots have retired or taken voluntary leave since September. Federal payroll aid to   blocked furloughs. Quigley said United’s need for new pilots will depend on the airline’s recovery from the pandemic. Airlines report that bookings have increased in recent weeks, and the government says at least 1 million travelers a day have gone through airport checkpoints for the past three weeks. Still, U.S. air travel remains down nearly half from the same period in 2019. United CEO Scott Kirby said this week that domestic leisure travel demand “has almost entirely recovered,” but critical business and international travel remain severely depressed.

Company producing J&J vaccine had history of violations,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/company-heart-jj-vaccine-woes-series-citations-76803905,"The company at the center of           that led Johnson & Johnson to discard 15 million doses of its coronavirus vaccine has a string of citations from U.S. health officials for quality control problems. Emergent BioSolutions, a little-known company vital to the vaccine supply chain, was a key to           to deliver 100 million doses of its single-shot vaccine to the United States by the end of May. But the Food and Drug Administration repeatedly has cited Emergent for problems such as poorly trained employees, cracked vials and problems managing mold and other contamination around one of its facilities, according to records obtained by The Associated Press through the Freedom of Information Act. The records cover inspections at Emergent facilities since 2017. Johnson & Johnson said Wednesday that a batch of vaccine made by Emergent at its Baltimore factory, known as Bayview, cannot be used because it did not meet quality standards. It was unclear how the problem would affect future deliveries of J&J's vaccine. The company said in a statement it was still planning to deliver 100 million doses by the end of June and was “aiming to deliver those doses by the end of May.” “Human errors do happen,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said Thursday in an interview on CBS' “This Morning.” ""You have checks and balances. ... That’s the reason why the good news is that it did get picked up. As I mentioned, that’s the reason nothing from that plant has gone into anyone that we’ve administered to.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that none of the J&J vaccine doses on the market are affected and the company was on track to deliver 24 million doses in April and 100 million doses by the end of May. “These are doses that the U.S. government has purchased, but we also have plenty of doses from Pfizer and Moderna, regardless, Psaki said.” J&J locked arms with Emergent in April 2020, enlisting the lesser-known company to manufacture the vaccine J&J was developing with federal money. At the time, Emergent’s Bayview facility wasn’t scaled for making millions of doses of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, according to the FDA records, which describe the plant as a contract testing laboratory that “did not manufacture products for distribution.” Upgrades in technology and personnel were required before Bayview could begin making what is known as “drug substance” material for the vaccine, a two-month process during which the required biological cells are grown. The FDA inspected Emergent’s Bayview plant in April 2020, just as the agreement with J&J was being announced. The federal agency criticized Emergent for problems with its testing of a potential treatment for anthrax, according to the records obtained by the AP. The FDA’s lead investigator cited the company for failing to train employees “in the particular operations they perform as part of their function and current good manufacturing practices.” On the same day, Johnson & Johnson, in a separate news release, heralded its partnership with Emergent as a step toward the pharmaceutical giant’s goal of supplying more than 1 billion doses of the vaccine globally by the end of 2021. But the FDA’s inspection of Emergent’s Bayview plant had faulted the company for a series of quality control shortcomings, according to the records. Although the inspection was not triggered by work on a COVID-19 vaccine, the issues listed by agency inspectors stand out due to the large role Emergent would soon have to combat the pandemic. The FDA criticized the Bayview plant for failing to ensure that electronic data generated through testing of drug ingredients “was protected from deletion or manipulation.” A closer review found 202 deletions and 543 reprocessed files, yet the company had not investigated how those alterations had occurred or their possible impact, according to the records. The FDA’s lead investigator, Marcellinus Dordunoo, wrote that Emergent had not investigated what he described as “data integrity concerns.” Emergent also did not follow proper testing and lab procedures at Bayview, the FDA said, noting that “deviations from test methods are not investigated, and are manually corrected days after performance, with no supporting data or documented justification.” The FDA also criticized Emergent for carelessness in the handling of rejected materials in the Bayview plant. An inspector observed items in a “reject cage” that did not have reject labels, and wrote that “separate or defined areas to prevent contamination or mix-ups are deficient.” The inspection was the most recent in a series of critical reports from the FDA about Emergent, including one following a December 2017 inspection at a plant in Canton, Massachusetts, in which the FDA said the company had not corrected “continued low level mold and yeast isolates” found in the facility. In September 2018, agency investigators questioned why Emergent had “an unwritten policy of not conducting routine compliance audits” at a separate plant in Baltimore, known as Camden, where an anthrax vaccine, BioThrax, is filled into vials. A few months earlier, FDA inspectors noted that the company's processes there were flawed. “Your firm received 3 complaints for residue on the outside of the vials for 3 different lots,” the FDA's inspection report said. Tests on that residue confirmed it was vaccine, according to the June 2018 report. The agency, in another finding from that inspection, noted Emergent's ongoing problems managing contamination at the Camden facility: “Procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile are not adequately established and followed.” FDA's inspectors also noted that Emergent staff filling vials of vaccine held “their hands directly above open vials” in a way that violated sterility safeguards. The FDA declined repeated requests to discuss the inspections at Emergent’s facilities. A spokesman said the agency “cannot comment on any particular company or any potential or ongoing compliance matters.” In an emailed statement, Emergent spokesman Matt Hartwig said the company’s “rigorous quality checks” identified a batch of drug substance that did not meet its standards. “Discarding a batch of bulk drug substance, while disappointing, does occasionally happen during vaccine manufacturing, which is a complex and multi-step biological process,” he said. Emergent’s revenues skyrocketed during the Trump administration, from about $523 million in 2015 to more than $1.5 billion in 2020. Emergent has invested heavily in lobbying the federal government, according to disclosure records that show the company spent $3.6 million on lobbying in 2020 alone. Emergent is one of about eight companies that Johnson & Johnson is using to speed up manufacturing of its recently approved coronavirus vaccine, the company said. The Bayview factory where the tainted vaccine ingredient was found had not yet been approved by the FDA, so no vaccine in circulation is affected. President Joe Biden has pledged to have           by the end of May. The U.S. government has ordered enough two-dose shots from Pfizer and Moderna to vaccinate 200 million people to be delivered by late May, plus the 100 million single-dose shots from J&J. A federal official said Wednesday evening that the administration’s goal can be met without additional J&J doses. A J&J spokesman said earlier Wednesday that the company met the end-of-March goal. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s online vaccine tracker showed J&J had provided about 6.8 million doses to the U.S. vaccine effort. J&J has been shipping finished vaccines from its factory in the Netherlands to the U.S. J&J said it was putting more of its manufacturing and quality experts inside Emergent’s factory to supervise production of the COVID-19 vaccine, a move meant to enable delivery of an additional 24 million vaccine doses through April. J&J said it still expects to deliver more than 1 billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year. The J&J vaccine has been viewed as crucial for vaccination campaigns around the world because only one shot is required and it can be shipped and stored at standard refrigeration temperatures, unlike some other vials that must be kept frozen. The company also has pledged to sell the vaccine without a profit, but only during the pandemic emergency. The problem with the vaccine batch was first reported by The New York Times. The FDA said it was aware of the situation but declined further comment. ——— Lardner reported from Washington, Dearen from Gainesville, Florida, and Johnson from Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania.

"Biden aims to juice EV sales, but would his plan work?",business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/biden-aims-juice-ev-sales-plan-work-76822731,"DETROIT -- Dangling tax credits and rebates in his drive to fight climate change, President   wants you to trade your gas-burning car, truck or SUV for a zero-emissions electric vehicle. Some buyers would find his offer persuasive. Yet Biden's goal is a daunting one: Even if Congress approves his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan, along with its incentives, it would take many years to replace enough internal combustion vehicles with EVs to make a huge dent in tailpipe emissions. Right now, there are about 279 million vehicles on the road in the United States. The proportion that are fully electric, according to IHS Markit, is 0.36%. Of the 14.5 million new vehicles that were sold last year, 2% were fully electric. Even if every new vehicle sold were battery powered — something no one envisions — it would take about 15 years to swap out the entire fleet. What's more, cars built during the past two decades last far longer than previous vehicles, so buyers are keeping them longer. The average U.S. vehicle has been on the road for nearly 12 years. Research shows that each EV sold does cut emissions. But it could take a couple of years for an EV to reach that point if coal is used to generate power to recharge the vehicle, said Bruce Belzowski, a retired University of Michigan transportation researcher who runs a company that studies the auto industry's future. “If you don't start somewhere, you're never going to get anywhere,” Belzowski said. “Every electric vehicle that you sell is going to be net positive for the environment.” The Biden administration didn't offer specifics on just how much car buyers would receive to trade in their vehicles. But it plans to spend $174 billion over eight years on EVs. That figure includes incentives for consumers, grants to build 500,000 charging stations, and money to develop U.S. supply chains for parts and minerals needed to make batteries. “We're going to provide tax incentives and point-of-sale rebates to all American families,” Biden said Wednesday. The biggest incentive likely will be expansion of the electric vehicle tax credit, now $7,500, which is phased out after an automaker sells 200,000 battery-electric vehicles. Tesla and General Motors have exceeded the cap. Nissan is getting close. A summary of Biden's plan didn't have any numbers. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, though, are backing a bill that would raise the cap to 600,000. The bill also includes a tax credit of at least $1,250 for those who buy used EVs. Jeff Schuster, president of global forecasting for LMC Automotive, an industry consulting firm, said that either the administration doesn't yet have specific numbers or deliberately omitted them while negotiations take place among the auto industry, Congress and environmental groups. “They know there's going to be some level of compromise needed,” he said. The form and size of the rebates also were not detailed. But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has proposed large discounts to those who buy American-made EVs — a possible reprise of the 2009 “Cash for Clunkers” program that offered $4,500 rebates for people to trade in less-efficient vehicles. The rebates and charging stations address two key reasons why many consumers are wary about switching to electric vehicles, Schuster said. Combined, he predicts that the incentives would help elevate EV sales from about 358,000 this year to over 1 million by 2023 and up to 4 million by 2030. If Biden's plan succeeds and EV sales take off, shortages of computer chips, metals used to build batteries, and a lack of battery factory capacity could leave the industry falling behind buyer demand, at least for a couple of years, Schuster said. David Kirsch, a professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland, said the Biden plan isn't really a tipping point that will turn consumers from combustion to electric vehicles. “There will be some good changes that will happen because of the scale of this investment, and those should not be minimized,"" Kirsch said. “I think electrification was coming anyway.” Indeed, the industry already was spending billions to develop EVs. LMC Automotive said 22 new electric models are coming out this year. A 2018 study by Alix Partners found that the global auto industry would spend $255 billion on EVs by 2023. At the same time, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that represents General Motors, Ford, Toyota and most major automakers, wrote in a letter to Biden that despite battery costs declining, EVs still are more expensive than combustion vehicles. The group, joined by the United Auto Workers union and a parts supply association, is urging the government to help address the difference. It is seeking tax credits, research spending and requirements to replace the federal fleet with electric vehicles. Even with such added spending, people in general will likely drive less in the future, because in the aftermath of the pandemic, many companies will allow a combination of work from home and office work. That will make some people even more reluctant to replace their vehicles, Schuster said. Yet Kirsch says that no matter how effective Biden's plan is or isn't in fighting climate change, the spending on modernizing the transportation fleet and infrastructure is long overdue. “What we're doing is playing catch-up on some long-delayed investment,” he said."
"With King Kong, a little swagger returns to the box office",business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/king-kong-swagger-returns-box-office-76817658,"NEW YORK -- Once again, mayhem and mass destruction is back at the box office. It’s almost like old times. “Godzilla vs. Kong,” one of the few tentpoles to dare release during COVID times, is poised this weekend to set a new high in ticket sales during the pandemic. It won’t be the kind of blockbuster business such a big-budget release would typically manage, but experts forecast a launch of at least $25 million. Opening-day ticket sales on Wednesday for “Godzilla vs. Kong” totaled $9.6 million, Warner Bros. said Thursday — a single-day pandemic record and more than most 2020-2021 opening weekend hauls. Last weekend, the monster mash pulled in an impressive $123.1 million internationally. In China,         where moviegoing is close to pre-pandemic levels, the movie made about $70 million, double the debut of 2014's “Godzilla."" For the first time in a long time, there’s the faint hint of a hit at the box office. “It’s a good omen that the tastes of the consumer have not shifted so much that there’s no possibility of restarting the movie business,” says Joshua Grode, chief executive of Legendary Entertainment, which produced “Godzilla vs. Kong."" “This tells everybody: the moviegoing business is here, and, yes, it may be different post-pandemic. But there is a viable industry there.” Huge challenges remain to the revival of moviegoing. With so many cinemas shuttered for nearly an entire year, many moviegoers are out of the habit. Some are unlikely to return to sitting indoors with strangers until they're vaccinated or the pandemic has ebbed. And even those who have been convinced of the safety of moviegoing by         theaters’ health protocols, they now have only more in-home options. “Godzilla vs. Kong” is streaming simultaneously on HBO Max in North America. But few scream big screen as much as King Kong and Godzilla. To help kickstart moviegoing and bring back a little chest-thumping swagger to theaters, the industry is counting on two of the movies’ most iconic, long-running leviathans. Laying another metropolis to waste might help movie theaters build themselves back up. “The issue is less convincing consumers to go to the movies than it is convincing studios to open their movies,” says Rich Gelfond, IMAX'S chief executive. “There’s been a hesitancy on the part of Hollywood studios to release movies because they haven’t been convinced the demand is there. What I really hope this weekend shows is that there is a lot of demand there and it convinces them to open a lot of movies that have been sitting on the shelf.” Since the launch of “Tenet” fizzled last August, and virus cases soared, most studios have been postponing or rerouting their biggest releases to streaming services. But as vaccinations have ramped up and restrictions have eased, more theaters have opened. About 60% of theaters will be open this weekend, according to data firm Comscore. On Monday,         Los Angeles County will expand cinema capacity from 25% to 50%. For the first time since last winter, wide release will mean playing in more than 3,000 theaters. That's still about 1,200 shy of typical for a title like “Godzilla vs. Kong."" Recently, ticket sales, while still far below their usual levels, are ticking upward. The best debut of 2021 was         “Tom & Jerry,” with $13.7 million in late February. The pandemic-high belongs to “Wonder Woman 1984,”         which launched with $16.7 million in December. Each were Warner Bros. releases that landed simultaneously on HBO Max —          a once controversial release plan  that has helped theaters stay afloat and proved an interesting test case for how viewers prefer to see, and pay for, a movie. Nevertheless, the Walt Disney Co.         recently delayed the planned summer-kickoff of “Black Widow” to July, while pushing a number of titles to its streaming platform, Disney+. Part of what’s holding blockbusters back is the need for a global release to make back their sizable production budgets and marketing spend. (“Godzilla vs. Kong” cost about $160 million to make.) While moviegoing in much of Asia is rejuvenated, rising cases in Europe and in countries like Brazil have, for now, made a full worldwide rollout impossible. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, believes “Godzilla vs. Kong” will be “another building block in our education in where the industry is heading.” “The theatrical experience will prove to be viable and resilient as it always has,” says Dergarabedian. “But it’s going to be a different world, no question. I think it’s going to be a leaner, meaner business going forward.” Some of the old standard practices that have governed blockbusters aren't coming back. Studios like Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures         have made deals to         shorten exclusive theatrical windows. Warner Bros. next year will hold movies in theaters for a minimum of 45 days, or half of the traditional window, before moving releases to at-home platforms. Such new models mean a recalibrating of what movies get greenlit and how much they're worth. “The value of those streaming/pay-TV rights are more valuable now because you’re getting access to them much, much earlier than you did before,” says Grode. “So you kind of have to rerun your model of how the movie is going to perform over its lifetime.” It's also meant some tense negotiations over profit participation. When Warner Bros. surprised with its hybrid release plans for 2021, Legendary — whose highly anticipated “Dune” is to be released in the fall by Warner Bros. — considered legal action before arriving at an agreement. “We obviously didn’t like the way they announced what they were doing in 2021, and I think they would admit they didn’t handle it perfectly,” says Grode. “But when you look at the state of the world, the facts as we all knew them at the time, their decision made a lot of sense.” “You get over that pretty quickly and you get back to business,” he added. Helping theaters get back to business, Gelfond believes, are large-format screens “that differentiate the couch as much as they can.” IMAX accounted for 14% of the Chinese box office for “Godzilla vs. Kong.” This weekend, the film will be playing on 1,170 IMAX screens worldwide. Showings in New York and Los Angeles, Gelfond said, are already sold out, albeit at lower capacity. The box office might not quite roar again this weekend, but “Godzilla vs. Kong” may show it has a little bite left. Says Grode: “In years from now, when people write about coming back to the movies, I’m very proud that ‘Godzilla vs. Kong’ will be in that history."" ——— Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP"
Auto sales rise 11% in 1Q on strong showing in March,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/auto-sales-rise-11-1q-strong-showing-march-76825057,"DETROIT -- U.S. auto sales rose more than 11% in the first quarter, as strong March sales far outpaced last year when   pandemic began. Automakers sold more than 3.9 million vehicles during the first three months of the year, with several major companies reporting March sales that nearly doubled from the same month a year earlier, according to figures compiled by Edmunds.com. Sales at Honda were up 93% in March, while Toyota sales rose 87%. Hyundai-Kia posted a 78% gain, while Nissan was up 65%.   reported a 46% increase, while Fiat Chrysler (now Stellantis) was up 45% and Ford reported a 26% increase. Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights for Cargurus.com, said retail sales to individual buyers were strong, but overall sales remain lower than pre-pandemic levels because of reduced fleet purchases. When the pandemic started, he said, buyers pulled back and retail sales fell for about a month. “I would say autos have been outperforming the greater economy from that point on,” he said. The combination of a $1.9 trillion government stimulus program and people looking for   to keep themselves isolated from others due to the virus should keep sales strong, he said. But         a shortage of computer chips is forcing automakers to cut production, and that could affect sales later in the year. Plus dealer supplies are tight and a lack of selection could make people delay purchases, Roberts said. Many others, though may want to buy immediately to drive rather than come in contact with others while traveling, he said. Industry analysts and executives say the chip shortage is likely to continue until at least the third quarter of the year."
Anticipation is building for a boom in US hiring this year,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/anticipation-building-boom-us-hiring-year-76818675,"WASHINGTON -- With hopes rising for a powerful rebound in hiring this year, Friday's jobs report for March will provide crucial insight into whether those rosy expectations may prove true. The most optimistic economists are predicting that the government will report that as many as 1 million jobs were added in March — a blistering gain that would help recover a decent chunk of the 9.5 million jobs that remain lost to the pandemic. Still, the increase might not be quite that large: Overall, economists surveyed by data provider FactSet have forecast an increase of 615,000. After a year of epic job losses, waves of coronavirus infections, and small business closures, numerous trends are brightening the outlook. Consumer confidence in March           since the pandemic intensified. Americans have increased their spending as the latest stimulus checks have been distributed. More states and cities are easing restrictions on restaurants, bars and indoor gatherings. Vaccinations are being increasingly administered, although new confirmed infections have risen from lower levels in recent weeks. The $1,400 checks in President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion           have sharply increased consumer spending, according to Bank of America's tracking of its debit and credit cards. Spending jumped 23% in the third week of March compared with pre-pandemic levels, the bank said. “We're seeing a powerful response to stimulus payments from the consumer,” said Michelle Meyer, an economist at Bank of America. “It's hard to keep up with the economic strength.” Lower-income Americans responded with particular vigor, with spending among cardholders earning under $50,000 soaring 69% compared with pre-pandemic levels. More than 127 million of the stimulus payments, worth $325 billion, have been distributed. Spending had begun to rise in March even before the stimulus checks arrived as viral case counts have tumbled from their heights in January. Americans are increasingly willing to venture out from home to travel and eat out, though not yet at their pre-pandemic pace. Roughly 1.5 million people traveled through airports on March 28, according to the Transportation Services Administration. That was roughly eight times the figure of a year ago, although it was still down sharply from 2.5 million on the same day in 2019. The transportation analytics firm Inrix has calculated that daily car trips           late last month. Many of those trips have likely been to restaurants, where the volume of seated diners was just 25% below pre-pandemic levels, on average, in the last week of March, according to OpenTable, a restaurant software provider. That's up from 50% below pre-pandemic traffic just six weeks earlier. The burgeoning economic activity is showing signs of translating into more jobs. Karen Fichuk, CEO of Randstad North America, a recruiting firm, said the company is seeking to fill 38% more permanent jobs than it was at the end of last year. Demand for workers is particularly strong in manufacturing, information technology, logistics, and health care. “We are definitely starting to see the economic recovery reach a turning point, including in the hardest hit industries, such as hospitality,” Fichuk said. “We can hardly keep up.” Job listings on the website Indeed.com jumped in the last week of March, with available jobs now 13.5% above pre-pandemic levels. Jed Kolko, Indeed's chief economist, said that job postings in higher-paid sectors, such as financial services and technology, have accelerated in the past couple of months. That increase is “a sign of longer-term economic confidence,” Kolko said, because employers typically don't advertise such positions until they're confident that the prospects for growth are sustainable. Robust job growth in March, however, will raise an important question: Can it continue at the same pace? Besides the 9.5 million fewer jobs that now exist in the U.S. economy than just before the virus struck, an additional 2 million or so jobs would have been added in the past year under normal circumstances. That means the U.S. economy still needs roughly 11.5 million more jobs to regain something close to full health. Louise Sheiner, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and formerly an economist at the Federal Reserve, estimates that hiring could average between 700,000 and 1 million a month for the rest of the year, if the economy expands at the 6.5% pace that the Fed and many economists expect. That would leave total job growth for 2021 at somewhere between 7 million and 10 million. In part, her forecast is based on the fact that the pandemic recession has deeply hurt labor-intensive parts of the economy, from hotels and restaurants to health care and the entertainment industry. A recovery in those sectors, even a partial one, would require significantly more hiring. In addition, Sheiner said, higher consumer spending, fueled by stimulus checks and pent-up savings, should drive job growth in other industries. For now, some recent economic figures have been disappointing, because of unseasonably cold weather and damaging storms in Texas and some other Southern states during February. Sales at retail stores, home construction and demand for large factory goods all slipped in that month. Yet the bounce-back from the severe weather may add to hiring gains in March, economists say. Construction companies could be one example. Collectively, they cut 61,000 jobs in February. But demand for new homes remains high, and most analysts say they think construction jobs snapped back in March."
"Asian shares higher after S&P 500 tops 4,000 points",business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/asian-stocks-follow-wall-st-strong-japan-korea-76805915,"BANGKOK -- Asian shares were higher Friday after a broad rally pushed the S&P 500 past 4,000 points for the first time. Many markets were closed for Good Friday. Tokyo surged more than 1% and Seoul and Shanghai also gained. Various industries are getting a lift from President Joe Biden’s massive infrastructural renewal initiative. The S&P 500 jumped 1.2% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.8%. ‘’As we enter Q2, optimism abounds as unquestionably spring is in the air with the macro focus squarely on the U.S. and the Biden administration infrastructure plan,"" Stephen Innes of Axi said in a report. Hopes are rising that the recovery from the pandemic and the boost to spending will spur a powerful rebound in U.S. hiring this year and           will provide crucial insight into whether those rosy expectations may prove true. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.4% to 29,821.30 and the Kospi in South Korea added 0.6% to 3,103.45. The Shanghai Composite index picked up 0.4% to 3,481.39. Stereo maker Onkyo Home Entertainment's shares plunged nearly 29% after falling 68% on Thursday as the company is due to be delisted in Tokyo after it reported a negative net worth for two straight years. The company has so far failed to raise enough funding to cover its debt and has forecast a net loss of 5.9 billion yen ($53.6 million) for the fiscal year that ended March 31. On Thursday, a tech company rally pushed the S&P 500 up 1.2% to 4,019.87, its first close above the 4,000 mark. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5% to 33,153.21. The technology-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.8% to 13,480.11. Smaller companies that stand to benefit from a quickly growing economy continued to notch solid gains. The Russell 2000 index picked up 1.5%, to 2,253.90. Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Google's parent company also were among the winners. Health care, household goods stocks and utilities were the only laggards. Technology stocks benefited from another drop in bond yields, which have been the driving force for the market for several weeks. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 1.67% from 1.73% the day before. Higher bond yields make stocks seem more expensive by comparison, and tech stocks are among the most expensive after their significant rise last year. The rally capped a holiday-shortened week for the stock market. U.S. stock exchanges will be closed in observance of Good Friday, though bond trading will be open for half a day, closing at noon Eastern time. Companies that would benefit from greater sales of electric vehicles also rose Thursday, a day after President Joe Biden outlined various measures to support their use as part of his          . Part of that plan includes installation of thousands of additional charging stations around the country. Electric vehicle charger operator ChargePoint gained 11.8%. Consumer sentiment has been improving along with construction spending and the accelerating rollout of vaccines. Investors are shifting money into companies and sectors that will benefit from people getting back to some semblance of a pre-pandemic normal. Airlines have been making gains this year as more people bet on a budding recovery for travel, but the industry still faces turbulence ahead. Discount carrier           underwhelmed on its first day of public trading. The Denver-based airline opened at $18.61, below the low end of a $19 to $21 price target, and closed at $18.85. The Labor Department said the number of Americans who           last week rose to 719,000 last week from 658,000 the previous week. That figure was expected to decline."
EXPLAINER: Who are the rebels in northern Mozambique?,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/explainer-rebels-northern-mozambique-76830097,"JOHANNESBURG -- With more than a week of fierce fighting including beheaded bodies in the streets, the battle for the northern Mozambique town of Palma has highlighted the southern Africa country’s insurgency and threats to its multibillion-dollar investments. Here's a look at what is known about the rebel group and the challenges facing Mozambique. WHO ARE THE REBELS? They're mostly unemployed young Muslim men from Cabo Delgado, the northernmost province on the country's long Indian Ocean coastline. For centuries, most people there have been Muslims who traded with Swahili dhow sailors and coexisted with Catholicism brought by Portuguese colonial rulers. Despite rich natural resources, the province has been one of Mozambique's least developed, with low levels of education,   services, and nutrition. In recent years some unemployed youths have studied abroad on scholarships from Muslim organizations and locals say many returned preaching a more radical form of Islam. In 2017, violence erupted against government targets by a few small bands, often using machetes to kill police and officials. The rebels have grown to several hundred, they use motorcycles and are now well-armed with automatic weapons and mortars. Military experts say many weapons come from abroad. WHAT ARE THEY CALLED? They are known locally as al-Shabab — Arabic for “youth” — but it seems to be just a handy nickname as they don't have any known affiliation with Somalia's jihadi rebels of the same name. For a few years, the insurgents didn't appear to be linked to any group, but in 2019, the Islamic State group began claiming responsibility for their attacks, calling them the Islamic State Central African Province. IS also posts photos and videos of the militants, often standing by the group's black flag. A video posted this week showed them dressed in a mix of camouflage and black shirts and red scarves, and speaking Swahili and some Arabic. ARE THEY GAINING GROUND? The number of attacks since 2017 has risen to more than 838, and more than 500 of those have been in the past year, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project. More than 2,600 people have been killed. The humanitarian crisis has also dramatically increased, from 90,000 displaced at the start of 2020 to more than 670,000 now, according to U.N. organizations. More than 900,000 people in the area need food aid, according to the World Food Program. After years of hit-and-run attacks, the rebels captured the port town of Mocimboa da Praia in August and have held it since then. They've attacked smaller towns in the surrounding area. In one massacre, they beheaded 50 people on a soccer pitch, according to a report confirmed by the Catholic bishop of Pemba, the provincial capital, where hundreds of thousands have fled. The rebels target government offices, kill local officials and rob banks. HOW IS THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDING? President Filipe Nyusi's government in Maputo, in the southernmost part of Mozambique, has launched a counterterrorism offensive by the national police and the military. It also has used a private military organization based in South Africa, the Dyck Advisory Group, which has sent helicopter gunships and other aircraft to find and attack the rebels. Because the rebels often mingle with civilians, military action is difficult. Atrocities have been committed by all sides — the rebels, the government forces and the mercenaries — according         to a March 2 report  by Amnesty International. The government and the Dyck group deny the charges, saying they are investigating them. IS MOZAMBIQUE GETTING HELP? The United States last month declared Mozambique's rebels to be a terror organization and sent special operations forces officers         to carry out a two-month training of Mozambique's marines. Portugal said it's sending 60 officers to provide training and said the European Union is considering military support. Mozambique is a member of the 16-nation Southern African Development Community, which has been closely watching the instability. The group has had a few meetings on the rebels but Mozambique hasn't yet requested direct military help from neighboring countries, including South Africa and Zimbabwe. WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC IMPACT? Rebel violence had caused a suspension of work by the French oil and gas firm Total in January. On March 24, Total said security had improved enough to allow it to resume, but within a few hours, the rebels attacked Palma, and Total once again evacuated workers from the fortified construction site. Experts say it will be a long time before stability is sufficiently restored for Total to get back to work. The huge deposits of natural gas are reported to be among the world's largest, and the government was hoping the projects would bring much-needed economic growth. Exxon also was planning an investment, but that appears to be on hold. “The whole gas gamble was bet on a promise of security, and Nyusi -- and Mozambique -- lost the bet,” wrote academic Joseph Hanlon in the newsletter Mozambique News Reports and Clippings. WHAT IS THE OUTLOOK FOR MOZAMBIQUE AND AFRICA? The rebels have grown in size and organization. Once viewed as a ragtag bunch of dissatisfied youths, their attacks are more strategic and they are spreading their reach over a large part of northern Cabo Delgado. Military experts say restoring stability will be a long, violent and challenging process. A more long-range solution would be to improve local governments and provide better services and living conditions, according to analysts and military experts. But that will be difficult, with the rebels already entrenched. Africa's arc of extremism — from the Sahel region in West Africa, to Nigeria's Boko Haram insurgency in central Africa and al-Shabab's entrenched conflict in Somalia in East Africa — has a new foothold in southern Africa in Mozambique that will be hard to dislodge."
"Italy may be in Easter lockdown, but the party's on at sea",business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/italy-easter-lockdown-partys-sea-76829872,"ABOARD THE MSC GRANDIOSA -- Italy may be in a strict   lockdown this Easter with travel restricted between regions and new quarantines imposed. But a few miles offshore, guests aboard the MSC Grandiosa cruise ship are shimmying to Latin music on deck and sipping cocktails by the pool. In one of the anomalies of lockdowns that have shuttered hotels and resorts around the world, the Grandiosa has been plying the Mediterranean Sea this winter with seven-night cruises, a lonely flag-bearer of the global cruise industry. After cruise ships were early sources of highly-publicized coronavirus outbreaks, the Grandiosa has tried to chart a course through the pandemic with strict anti-virus protocols approved by Italian authorities that seek to create a “health bubble” on board. Passengers and crew are tested before and during cruises. Mask mandates, temperature checks, contact-tracing wristbands and frequent cleaning of the ship are all designed to prevent outbreaks. Passengers from outside Italy must arrive with negative COVID-19 tests taken within 48 hours of their departures and only residents of Europe's Schengen countries plus Romania, Croatia and Bulgaria are permitted to book under COVID-19 insurance policies. On Wednesday, the Grandiosa left the Italian port of Civitavecchia for its weeklong Easter cruise, with 2,000 of its 6,000-passenger capacity and stops planned in Naples and Valletta, Malta, before returning to its home port in Genoa. Passengers welcomed the semblance of normalcy brought on by the freedom to eat in a restaurant or sit poolside without a mask, even if the virus is still a present concern. “After a year of restrictive measures, we thought we could take a break for a week and relax,” said Stefania Battistoni, a 39-year-old teacher and single mother who drove all night from Bolzano, in northern Italy, with her two sons and mother to board the cruise. The pandemic has plunged global cruise ship passenger numbers from a record 30 million in 2019 to over 350,000 since July 2020, according to Cruise Lines International, the world’s largest cruise industry association representing 95% of ocean-going cruise capacity. Currently, fewer than 20 ships are operating globally, a small fraction of CLIA’s members’ fleets of 270 ships. The United States could be among the last cruise ship markets to reopen, possibly not until fall and not until 2022 in Alaska. Two Royal Caribbean cruise lines that normally sail out of Miami opted instead to launch sailings in June from the Caribbean, where governments are eager to revive their tourism-based economies. MSC spokeswoman Lucy Ellis said positive virus cases have cropped up on board MSC ships, particularly during the fall surge. “The important thing is we have never had an outbreak,’’ she said. The Grandiosa is equipped with a medical center with molecular and antigen testing facilities, as well as a ventilator. Extra cabins are set aside to isolate suspected virus cases. Because of the contact tracing wrist bands, if a passenger tests positive, medical personnel can identify anyone with whom they were in contact. Once the situation is clear, anyone who is positive is transferred to the shore. According to an independent consulting firm, Bermello Ajamii & Partners, just 23 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed on ships since the industry began its tentative relaunch last summer, for a passenger infection rate of 0.006%. But cruise industry critics say the risk isn’t worth it and add that cruise companies should have taken the pandemic timeout to address the industry's longstanding environmental and labor problems. “All large cruise ships burn huge volumes of the dirtiest, cheapest fuel available,” said Jim Ace of environmental group Stand Earth, a member of the Global Cruise Activist Network. “Cruise ship companies could have used the COVID shutdown to address their impacts on public health and the environment. Instead, they scrapped a few of their oldest ships and raised cash to stay alive.” On board, though, passengers are relishing the chance to enjoy activities that have been mostly closed in Italy and much of Europe for a year: a theater, restaurant dining, duty-free shopping and live music in bars. The rest of Italy is heading back into full lockdown over the Easter weekend, with shops closed and restaurants and bars open for takeout only to try to minimize holiday outbreaks. In addition, Italy’s government imposed a five-day quarantine on people entering from other EU countries in a bid to deter Easter getaways. “Let’s say that after such a long time of restrictions and closures, this was a choice done for our mental health,” said Federico Marzocchi, who joined the cruise with his wife and 10-year-old son Matteo. The cruise industry is hoping for a gradual opening this spring. Cruises are circulating on Spain’s Canary islands in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa, including the company AIDA catering to German tourists. Costa Cruises, which with MSC is one of Europe’s largest cruise companies, will resume cruises on May 1, with seven-night Italy-only cruises. Costa plans to begin sailing in the western Mediterranean from mid-June. Britain is opening to cruise ships in May, with MSC and Viking launching cruises of the British Isles, among several companies offering at-sea “staycation” cruises aimed at capturing one of the most important cruise markets. The cruise industry is hoping Greece will open in mid-May, but the country hasn't yet announced when it will reopen tourism. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a “framework” for resuming cruises in the U.S., but the industry says the health agency hasn't spelled out the details that companies need to operate their ships. Once the CDC provides technical requirements, industry officials say it takes about 90 days to prepare a ship for sailing. The cruise companies complain that last fall’s CDC framework is outdated and should be scrapped. They say it was issued before vaccines were available and before the restart of cruises in Europe, which they say have safely carried nearly 400,000 passengers under new COVID-19 protocols. And they complain that cruising is the only part of the U.S. economy that remains shuttered by the pandemic. The Cruise Lines International Association trade group is lobbying for an early July start to U.S. cruising. “Cruisers love to cruise, and they will go where the ships are sailing,” said Laziza Lambert, a spokeswoman for the trade group. “The longer cruises are singularly prohibited from operating in the United States, the more other places in the world will benefit from the positive economic impact generated by an influx of passengers.” ——— AP reporters Colleen Barry in Soave, Italy, Nicole Winfield in Rome, and David Koenig in Dallas, contributed to this report. ——— Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak"
Ford announces new carbon neutral targets,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/ford-announces-carbon-neutral-targets/story?id=76796290,"Ford has announced two new  al sustainability targets as part of its goal to become carbon neutral by 2050, in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. The targets are part of the automaker's first-ever combined sustainability and financial report. ""The integrated report underscores what we do to achieve our goals for the environment,"" Cynthia Williams, global director for sustainability, homologation and compliance at Ford Motor Company, told ABC Radio. ""It's also the social matters and governance. It's vital for success on behalf of all of our key stakeholders as we move forward. I think combining those is key to success for Ford."" In June 2020, Ford announced plans to go carbon neutral, meaning that the number of emissions released by the company will be reduced or offset by renewable energy, carbon sequestration or carbon credits. Ford plans to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from operations by 76%, based on 2017 emissions, and scope 3 emissions from all of the company's products by 50%, based on 2019 emissions, by 2035. Scope 1 emissions include emissions directly controlled by Ford, like the buildings and company vehicles. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions, such as the electricity used to power offices or manufacturing buildings, while scope 3 is all the emissions from its supply chain. The scope 1 and 2 targets are aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement. ""We've always been grounded in science and we've been committed to climate change, and so developing a carbon-neutral strategy is just part of what we've done to continue to align with our Paris Agreement,"" said Williams. The two new targets are endorsed by the Science-Based Targets Initiative, a collaboration between U.N. agencies, businesses and industry leaders that help companies set emission reduction targets. Ford says it wants to focus on three main areas to reduce emissions: car production, company facilities and suppliers. The company plans to invest $22 billion in electric vehicles through 2025. That includes electrifying some of its most popular cars. ""Expanding our EV plan is part of our solution to [become] carbon neutral by 2050. It's key and I think doubling our investment to EV (electric vehicle) technology and infrastructure ... is just an example of what we're doing to make sure that we stay on the path to get to carbon neutrality,"" said Williams. To reduce global emissions at Ford facilities, the company has set a goal to use 100% locally sourced renewable energy by 2035. Ford says its Michigan assembly plants in Dearborn and Wayne, along with its research, engineering and Corktown campuses, will meet this goal by January 2022. To reduce emissions from its suppliers, Ford says it plans to work with suppliers to understand its collective environmental footprint, help selected suppliers reduce emissions by using its Partnership for A Cleaner Environment program and continue to collaborate with partners in the automotive industry to lower supplier emissions. But Williams says Ford knows it cannot achieve these goals alone. ""We need partnerships with our suppliers, public-private partners, with the utilities and the like to make sure that we can realize these goals,"" said Williams."
Dutch coalition building must reboot after Rutte rebuke,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/dutch-coalition-building-reboot-rutte-rebuke-76831329,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte needs a political reboot only two weeks after a major   victory because new questions about his trustworthiness are undermining the process of forming a new coalition government. Rutte, who has been in power for more than a decade and is seeking to build his fourth governing coalition, narrowly survived a no-confidence motion in the early hours of the morning after a marathon debate in parliament in which he claimed to not remember talking about a critical Christian Democrat lawmaker. Rutte last week publicly denied discussing the lawmaker at all. Opposition lawmakers accused prime minister of lying and of wrecking public trust in the country’s politicians. Rutte denied lying and vowed to work hard to rebuild trust. He plans to continue looking to form a new coalition, but that could prove difficult after two of the key parties he would seek to enlist tabled a motion of censure against him that was supported by a large majority in the 150-seat lower house of parliament. “I have gotten the message and taken it to heart,” said Rutte, who is sometimes called the Teflon premier for his ability to avoid scandals sticking to him. It was a stunning fall from grace for Rutte, coming just over two weeks after his conservative party won the most seats in parliament in the  , putting him in line to become the country’s longest-serving prime minister if he can create a new coalition. If he wants to achieve the feat, he will have to mend bridges first. “My trust in Mr. Rutte has been seriously dented today,” Sigrid Kaag, leader of the centrist D66 party told Parliament in the early hours of Friday. “The distance between him and me is wider. I regret that.” D66 finished second in the elections and is a current member of Rutte’s coalition. The country’s Christian Democrats party, a favored coalition partner for Rutte, co-sponsored the censure motion, but left open the possibility of working together. “It is crucial that we restore trust,” Christian Democrat leader Wopke Hoekstra said. Lawmakers are now expected to install a new official to restart coalition talks, which are expected to take months. The coalition crisis comes against a backdrop of rising numbers of   infections despite a lockdown that has lasted months. More than 16,700 people are confirmed to have died of COVID-19 in the country and Rutte’s government faced harsh criticism for the slow start of its vaccination campaign. Central to the crisis is Christian Democrat lawmaker Pieter Omtzigt, who has long been a thorn in the side of Rutte with his critical questions about scandals that have dogged the prime minister in recent years. Lawmakers accused Rutte of seeking to sideline Omtzigt in preliminary coalition talks after one of the two officials leading the talks was photographed carrying notes including the legible line: “Position Omtzigt, function elsewhere.” After the note was photographed, Rutte told reporters he hadn't discussed Omtzigt in coalition talks. But he did, according to notes made by civil servants that were published before the debate that started Thursday. Rutte said in the debate that he didn't remember that part of the discussion and had answered reporters’ questions “in good conscience.” “I am not standing here lying. I am telling the truth,” Rutte said. Rutte apologized to Omtzigt and pledged: “Where trust has been violated … I will work hard to restore it.” Omtzigt wasn't present for the debate. He is taking time off, citing exhaustion. Kaag said she had seen a “pattern of forgetfulness, amnesia” from Rutte over his more than a decade in office. “How can you, in the greatest crisis that we face in the Netherlands, restore the trust that has again been damaged?” Kaag asked."
EU nations struggle to full show vaccination solidarity,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/eu-nations-struggle-full-show-vaccination-solidarity-76830165,"BRUSSELS -- The European Union is struggling to show complete   vaccination solidarity among member nations, after a week of negotiations over the distribution of extra doses exposed fissures on Friday. Five EU nations that struggled most to get their vaccination drive going were given extra doses from an alliance of 19 other countries. Three nations weren't part of the deal, however, showing the difficulties of compromise politics when COVID-19 cases are surging again. At an EU summit last week, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz criticized the allocation of shots in the 27-nation bloc, saying that some countries were receiving more than their fair share at the cost of others. EU leaders failed to agree on a correction mechanism, leaving it to their EU ambassadors. Late Thursday, a deal was reached on how to distribute an early batch of 10 million Pfizer-BioNTech doses with Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia receiving a proportionally large number of doses. Austria, along with the Czech Republic and Slovenia, didn't get additional shots. “We are grateful for the remarkable efforts"" and solidarity of fellow EU member states, Latvian Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš said. He said the extra shots “will bring us closer to our common goal — a collective immunity across the EU.” Under the joint procurement program set up by the European Commission, doses are allocated on a pro rata basis, but some nations are taking less than their share. A large majority of EU members think the system is working well, but said some nations made a mistake to focus on AstraZeneca shots instead of diversifying their vaccine portfolios. AstraZeneca shots are cheaper and easier to handle than   from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna. Overall, the EU continues to lag well behind nations like the United Kingdom and United States when it comes to vaccinations. ——— Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak"
Tesla 1Q sales of 185K more than double last year's numbers,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/tesla-1q-sales-185k-double-years-numbers-76833499,"DETROIT -- Tesla says it delivered nearly 185,000 electric vehicles in the first quarter despite a shortage of computer chips that has hit the global auto industry. The number was more than double the deliveries for the same period last year. And it beat Wall Street estimates of 168,000 for January through March. The company says in a statement that the Model Y small SUV in China has been well received. Tesla lists no production figures for its older models, the S sedan and X SUV, during the quarter, but it delivered just over 2,000 of them. It says new equipment has been installed at the Fremont, California, factory and production of new versions is in the early stages. The strong sales are a sign that demand for the company's relatively expensive vehicles remains strong despite the pandemic. Analysts polled by data provider FactSet estimate that the average selling price of a Tesla is $49,100. Shares of Tesla Inc. are down more than 9% so far this year as some of the shine wore off electric vehicle and tech stocks, which had experienced a big runup last year. The stock closed Thursday down just under 1% at $661.75. Markets are closed for the Good Friday holiday. Tesla sold just under 500,000 vehicles last year, barely missing a target set by CEO  . The company hasn’t given much guidance for this year’s sales figures. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called the first-quarter numbers a “jaw dropper,” and a huge home run in the eyes of bullish investors. “We believe China and Europe were particularly robust this quarter as the trajectory now puts Musk & Co. to exceed 850k for the year which is well ahead of whisper expectations,” he wrote Friday. The Model 3 small car and the Model Y accounted for nearly all of the Palo Alto, California, company’s first-quarter sales. Tesla said it sold 182,780 of both models combined. Ives wrote that analysts expected more than 12,000 sales of Models S and X, with the miss driven by the chip shortage. The strong sales came even though the company shut down much of its Fremont production for several weeks in late February and early March. It did not say why, but it’s likely that the company ran short of computer chips. President Joe Biden's announcement this week of $174 billion in spending on electric vehicle incentives and charging stations, and rising global demand for electric vehicles should shift sentiment toward Tesla stock, Ives wrote. “It's been a brutal sell-off for Tesla and EVs, but we believe that will now be in the rearview mirror,” he wrote."
Russian entrepreneurs adapt to virus lockdown challenges,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/russian-entrepreneurs-adapt-virus-lockdown-challenges-76830237,"MOSCOW -- Valentina Konstantinova remembers well when Russia locked down for the   a year ago. Her 18-room boutique hotel, called Skazka, or “Fairytale,” was full, and within a couple of days, it had only one guest left. “I still don’t understand how people could have vanished in one day, and where,” she recalled. The lockdown lasted six weeks, but with borders closed, her business prospects were grim. One year later, Skazka is still open — thanks to some creative thinking by its owners — but with fewer guests than before. Russia was never fully locked down again after last spring, and as a result, its economy and some of its businesses didn't suffer as much as those in some countries during the pandemic. But it also has seen its mortality rates rise. When infections surged again in the fall, the government resisted imposing restrictions that would have shut many businesses. Had there been another lockdown, “we'd be closed already,” Konstantinova said. A six-week lockdown still damaged the weakening economy and compounded Russians' frustrations over declining incomes and worsening living conditions. President Vladimir Putin's approval rating fell from 69% in February 2020 to a historic low of 59% two months later before rebounding, according to the Levada Center, Russia's top independent pollster. For the rest of 2020, industries and enterprises mostly stayed open. During a virus resurgence in the fall, some regions imposed restrictions that limited the hours or capacity of bars, restaurants and other businesses, but rarely were they closed altogether. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Russia’s gross domestic product fell by just 3.6% — a little more than the global average of 3.4%. By comparison, GDP in the U.K. shrank by 9.9%. France by 8.2%, Germany by 5.3%, and Canada by 5.4%. Still, it was Russia’s biggest plunge since 2009. In recent years, its GDP grew by about 1-2% per year. At the same time, Russia saw a significant increase in mortality, said Sergei Guriev, economics professor at Sciences Po institute of political studies in Paris. The number of overall deaths in 2020 grew by nearly 324,000, compared with the previous year, according to the statistical agency Rosstat. The country recorded over 97,000 deaths from COVID-19, according to Johns Hopkins University, although experts say the actual number is probably higher and even Rosstat said over 200,000 people with the virus died between April 2020 and January 2021. “These losses, which could have obviously been avoided, are the price of the Russian economy not shutting down and of the Russian GDP only shrinking by 3%,” Guriev said. Online sales had a good year. Ozon, a major Russian e-commerce platform similar to Amazon, saw sales jump almost 2.5 times last year, the company’s communications director Maria Zaikina said. But even without a second lockdown, some small- and medium-sized businesses needed creative ways to stay afloat, with government support mostly limited to tax deferrals, cheap but hard-to-get loans, and relatively small direct subsidies. Many aren't earning what they did before the pandemic. A survey of 5,000 such enterprises found that about a third are still seeing a decline in revenue at the start of 2021. The survey, conducted by Russia's business ombudsman Boris Titov and cited by the news outlet RBC last month, said about 27% reported revenue at the same level as last year and nearly one in 10 was looking to close. Only about 19% said they are slowly starting to recover. Nearly 60% of the companies asked pointed to a still-depressed demand for products and services as one of the biggest difficulties they face. Russians’ incomes fell by 3.5% last year, Guriev said, noting that Moscow spent much less supporting businesses and consumers than other countries, where governments took “unprecedentedly generous measures."" That could be because the government, with its sovereign wealth fund worth $165 billion in April 2020, was reluctant to open state coffers last spring, when oil prices had plunged. During the first lockdown, Konstantinova still wanted to make use of her hotel, which is located in a museum and entertainment complex built in a style that mimics 17th-century Russian architecture. Working with NGOs and aid groups, she offered free rooms to victims of domestic violence, refugees, doctors and foreigners who got stuck in Russia. With tourists unlikely to return anytime soon, Konstantinova was looking for ways to transform her hotel. Some of her nonpaying guests were originally from India, and she decided to tap their expertise to add a restaurant serving authentic Indian cuisine. The project took off, and her business is now breaking even. “Profit is out of the question at this point, of course, as is early repayment of loans,"" she said. ""But the fact that we’re working at a break-even level is important. It means that when the market recovers, the business is likely to earn a profit.” Artyom Borovoy, co-founder of a company that builds stands for exhibitions, was in a similar situation. When convention business ground to a halt, Borovoy’s company Stend-Do started making folding desks for those working from home — an idea he said came from Zoom discussions with his friends “out of desperation.” Simple, inexpensive plywood desks that fold like an easel and can be used either sitting or standing proved popular for those working remotely from tiny apartments. Borovoy sold about 2,100 last year, but admits the new project is making only enough to cover costs. “In terms of profit, there isn’t any yet,” he said. Both Borovoy and Konstantinova say they didn't get any significant government support, aside from tax deferrals. Amid the restrictions, some businesses turned to acts of defiance to preserve their income. In St. Petersburg, where tough restrictions were imposed because of a virus surge during the New Year's holidays in December and January, there was a backlash from restaurant and bar owners who were ordered to shut between Dec. 31 and Jan. 3, and required to close at 7 p.m. for a week after that. Dozens of owners joined what was called the “Map of Resistance” — a short-lived website listing bars and restaurants that refused to obey the restrictions. “How else were we supposed to survive?"" said Mikhail Kavin, manager of the Commode bar — just off the city's famed Nevsky Prospekt — that features rooms named for different cultural figures such as “Gershwin,” “Brando,” “Rockefeller” and “Lebowski.” “People needed to be able to eat and work. The authorities were unwilling to enter into a dialogue. They did not provide any support, neither to employees nor business owners,"" he said, noting that joining the Map of Resistance ”was our only way to be heard."" Police raided Commode in early December for serving customers behind closed doors past 11 p.m. Security video showed a dozen officers in balaclavas breaking through the door and later walking amid patrons who apparently were made to lie on the floor, and beating some with batons. Authorities eventually eased the restrictions: Cafes, restaurants and bars were still banned from operating between Dec. 31 and Jan. 3 unless they had “winter terraces” serving customers outside, but they could open between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. the week after that. Commode operated during the holidays despite the restrictions, but even with flouting the rules, it hasn't bounced back to its pre-pandemic level of sales, Kavin said. “Maybe some months or weeks were an exception to the rule, but it’s a long, long way to go to a full recovery,” he added. ——— Daniel Kozin reported from both Moscow and St. Petersburg. ——— Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine https://apnews.com/hub/understanding-the-outbreak"

According to an independent consulting firm, Bermello Ajamii & Partners, just 23 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed on ships since the industry began its tentative relaunch last summer, for a passenger infection rate of 0.006%. But cruise industry critics say the risk isn’t worth it and add that cruise companies should have taken the pandemic timeout to address the industry's longstanding environmental and labor problems. “All large cruise ships burn huge volumes of the dirtiest, cheapest fuel available,” said Jim Ace of environmental group Stand Earth, a member of the Global Cruise Activist Network. “Cruise ship companies could have used the COVID shutdown to address their impacts on public health and the environment. Instead, they scrapped a few of their oldest ships and raised cash to stay alive.” On board, though, passengers are relishing the chance to enjoy activities that have been mostly closed in Italy and much of Europe for a year: a theater, restaurant dining, duty-free shopping and live music in bars. The rest of Italy is heading back into full lockdown over the Easter weekend, with shops closed and restaurants and bars open for takeout only to try to minimize holiday outbreaks. In addition, Italy’s government imposed a five-day quarantine on people entering from other EU countries in a bid to deter Easter getaways. “Let’s say that after such a long time of restrictions and closures, this was a choice done for our mental health,” said Federico Marzocchi, who joined the cruise with his wife and 10-year-old son Matteo. The cruise industry is hoping for a gradual opening this spring. Cruises are circulating on Spain’s Canary islands in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa, including the company AIDA catering to German tourists. Costa Cruises, which with MSC is one of Europe’s largest cruise companies, will resume cruises on May 1, with seven-night Italy-only cruises. Costa plans to begin sailing in the western Mediterranean from mid-June. Britain is opening to cruise ships in May, with MSC and Viking launching cruises of the British Isles, among several companies offering at-sea “staycation” cruises aimed at capturing one of the most important cruise markets. The cruise industry is hoping Greece will open in mid-May, but the country hasn't yet announced when it will reopen tourism. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a “framework” for resuming cruises in the U.S., but the industry says the health agency hasn't spelled out the details that companies need to operate their ships. Once the CDC provides technical requirements, industry officials say it takes about 90 days to prepare a ship for sailing. The cruise companies complain that last fall’s CDC framework is outdated and should be scrapped. They say it was issued before vaccines were available and before the restart of cruises in Europe, which they say have safely carried nearly 400,000 passengers under new COVID-19 protocols. And they complain that cruising is the only part of the U.S. economy that remains shuttered by the pandemic. The Cruise Lines International Association trade group is lobbying for an early July start to U.S. cruising. “Cruisers love to cruise, and they will go where the ships are sailing,” said Laziza Lambert, a spokeswoman for the trade group. “The longer cruises are singularly prohibited from operating in the United States, the more other places in the world will benefit from the positive economic impact generated by an influx of passengers.” ——— AP reporters Colleen Barry in Soave, Italy, Nicole Winfield in Rome, and David Koenig in Dallas, contributed to this report. ——— Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak"

UK bans travel from 4 more nations over virus; 39 in all,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uk-bans-travel-nations-virus-39-76833908,"LONDON -- The British government is gearing up to ban international arrivals from four more countries — Bangladesh, Kenya, Pakistan and the Philippines — amid concerns over new virus variants but opted against including European nations that are facing a resurgence of the virus. The Department for Transport said Friday the number of countries on its “red list” will reach 39 when the latest restrictions take effect in England beginning April 9. The other nations of the U.K. — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — have similar lists. Under the travel bans, international visitors who have departed from or traveled through red-list countries in the preceding 10 days are refused entry into England. Countries on the list include Brazil and South Africa, where two of the most concerning virus variants have been identified. British and Irish citizens and people who have residence rights in the U.K. can enter, as commercial flights are not banned. However, they must quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days at their own expense and must take a COVID-19 test on days two and eight of their self-isolation. The measures are aimed at reducing the risk posed by new virus variants into the U.K., which has recorded Europe’s highest COVID-related death toll, with over 126,500 deaths. No European nations are on the British red list, even though much of Europe is witnessing a resurgence of the virus that has prompted many countries to reimpose lockdown restrictions. Health experts say the surge is being driven by virus variants, including the one first identified in Britain, that are sweeping the continent. The World Health Organization on Thursday bemoaned the slow pace of vaccinations in European nations other than Britain, saying they were losing the race to protect their people. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government has faced questions in recent days as to why France, which is suffering one of the worst outbreaks in Europe, is not on the list. Yet putting France on the red list could have serious implications for trade flows in and out of the U.K., given its reliance on traffic from cross-Channel ports. The U.K. transport department said the majority of cases of the South African variant detected in England so far were linked to international travel and that very few are thought to have come from Europe. The U.K. has seen new coronavirus infections and deaths fall sharply since the winter amid a strict 3-month lockdown and a rapid rollout of coronavirus vaccines. The U.K. has now given a first vaccine shot to over 31 million people, or around 46% of its population, a much higher rate than the rest of Europe. This week restrictions on gatherings in England were relaxed following a big drop in new cases from a daily rate of around 70,000 earlier this year. The U.K. on Friday recorded 3,402 new infections, its lowest level since mid-September. The main easing this week allows groups of up to six people, or two households, to meet outdoors. Johnson on Friday urged people to follow the rules and to not mix indoors during this Easter weekend even if people have received a vaccine shot. “Even though your friends and family members may be vaccinated, the vaccines are not giving 100% protection, and that’s why we just need to be cautious,"" he said during a question and answer session on Twitter. “We don’t think that they entirely reduce or remove the risk of transmission.” ——— Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at                     and         "
Russia fines Twitter for not taking down calls to protest,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/russia-fines-twitter-taking-calls-protest-76834925,"MOSCOW -- A court in Moscow on Friday fined Twitter for not taking down calls encouraging minors to take part in unauthorized rallies, the latest in a series of moves against the social media giant that has been used to amplify dissent in Russia. The court found Twitter guilty on three counts of violating regulations on restricting unlawful content, ordering the company to pay three fines adding up to 8.9 million rubles (about $117,000). The ruling comes two weeks after Russia's state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor threatened to block Twitter within 30 days if it doesn't take steps to remove banned content. Roskomnadzor last month accused Twitter of failing to remove content encouraging suicide among children, as well as information about drugs and child pornography. The agency         announced on March 10 it was slowing down the speed of uploading photos and videos to the platform because of that. Twitter in response has emphasized its policy of zero tolerance for child sexual exploitation, the promotion of suicide and drug sales. Less than a week later, deputy chief of Roskomnadzor Vadim Subbotin         argued that Twitter still wasn’t complying with the demands of the Russian authorities, adding that “if things go on like this, then in a month it will be blocked."" Russian authorities earlier this year criticized social media platforms for bringing tens of thousands of people into the streets across Russia in January to demand the release of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most well-known critic. The wave of demonstrations was the largest in years and posed a major challenge to the Kremlin. The authorities alleged that social media platforms failed to remove calls for children to join the protests. Putin has urged police to act more to monitor social platforms and to track down those who “draw the children into illegal and unsanctioned street actions.” Twitter on Friday offered no comment on the Moscow court ruling. The Russian government’s efforts to tighten control of the internet and social media date back to 2012, when a law allowing authorities to blacklist and block certain online content was adopted. Since then, a growing number of restrictions targeting messaging apps, websites and social media platforms have been introduced in Russia. The government has repeatedly aired threats to block Facebook and Twitter but stopped short of outright bans, probably fearing the move would elicit too much public outrage. Only the social network LinkedIn, which wasn’t very popular in Russia, has been banned by the authorities for the failure to store its user data in Russia. However, some experts have said Russian authorities might be seriously considering the possibility of bans this time around. ——— Associated Press writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report."
"Unemployment rate falls to 6% in March, employers add 916,000 jobs",business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/unemployment-rate-falls-march-employers-add-916000-jobs/story?id=76788420,"The U.S. unemployment rate last month slipped to 6% as some 916,000 jobs were added to the economy, the Department of Labor said Friday. Friday's jobs report comes amid glimmers of hope that the end of the pandemic is within sight, as   across the country and vaccine access is  . The economy, however, still bears deep scars from the health crisis. Before COVID-19 shocked the economy, the unemployment rate in the U.S. was at a historic low of 3.5%. President Joe Biden reacted to the report, which beat analysts' expectations, during a press briefing. ""This morning we’ve learned that our economy created 900,000 jobs in March. That means the first two months of our administration has seen more new jobs created than the first two months in any administration in history,"" Biden said. ""But we still have a long way to go to get our economy back on track after the worst economic and jobs crisis in nearly a century."" The president touted his American Rescue Plan for contributing to the robust job gains last month. He also discussed the accelerating U.S. vaccination program, which he called ""the envy of the world."" Biden also urged Congress to take action in passing his  . The president called the roughly $2 trillion plan to modernize roads, bridges, broadband access and more a ""once in a generation investment in our economic future."" Despite the positive job gains, Biden said Friday's report also ""reminds us how deep a hole we started in,"" noting that there are still 8.4 million fewer jobs in the economy today than in March 2020. In the report, the Department of Labor credited the improvements in the labor market to the ""continued resumption of economic activity that had been curtailed due to the   (COVID-19) pandemic."" ""Job growth was widespread in March, led by gains in leisure and hospitality, public and private education, and construction,"" the DOL added. The leisure and hospitality industry added some 280,000 jobs last month, with nearly two-thirds of them in food services and drinking places (which saw an uptick of 176,000 jobs). Employment in public and private education also rose last month, with an uptick of 76,000 in local government education, a rise of 50,000 in state government education and an increase in 64,000 jobs in private education. Construction, meanwhile, added some 110,000 jobs last month. Robust job gains in the leisure and hospitality sector is ""a good indication that employers in that sector are starting to feel more optimistic about at least the medium to short term future,"" Nick Bunker, the director of economic research at hiring site Indeed, told ABC News ahead of Friday's report. ""Gains there are very good see because not only is that indication that there's some optimism there, but also those are the kinds of jobs that have been hit hardest,"" he added. Employment in leisure and hospitality is still down by 3.1 million jobs, or 18.5%, compared to February 2020, the BLS said. Broken down by racial groups, the unemployment rate for white workers last month was 5.4% versus 9.6% for Black workers, 7.9% for Hispanic workers and 6% for Asian workers. ""The impact of the pandemic and the fallout in the labor market have been disproportionately borne by workers of color and women -- women of color in particular -- so it's important ... that we're seeing job gains particularly for people who have been hit hardest,"" Bunker said. Friday's better-than-expected jobs report offered economists some optimism for the pace of the recovery. ""Springtime is here for the economic recovery, as today's jobs report showed the economy growing at its fastest pace since September,"" Daniel Zhao, a senior economist at Glassdoor, said in a commentary Friday morning. ""March's jobs report is the most optimistic report since the pandemic began."" ""While the pandemic is not over yet, the finish line appears close and the economy is surging forward in a last sprint toward a full reopening,"" Zhao added. ""If that momentum continues, we may be looking at a bright summer with monthly gains of over a million jobs, getting us much closer to pre-pandemic employment."""
Biden's 'jobs Cabinet' to sell infrastructure as GOP resists,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/bidens-jobs-cabinet-sell-infrastructure-gop-resists-76836604,"WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden is setting about convincing America it needs his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan, deputizing a five-member “jobs Cabinet” to help in the effort. But the enormity of his task is clear after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's vowed to oppose the plan “every step of the way.” Speaking in Kentucky on Thursday, McConnell said he likes Biden and they’ve been friends a long time. But the president will get no cooperation from the GOP, which objects to the corporate tax increases in the plan and says they would hurt America's ability to compete in a global economy. “We have some big philosophical differences, and that’s going to make it more and more         difficult for us to reach bipartisan agreements,"" the Republican leader said. Biden, speaking at the White House on Friday, noted that Republicans have been talking for years about the need to rebuild the nation's infrastructure, and he predicted that GOP lawmakers would face pressure from their supporters if they don't act. “I think the Republican voters are going to have a lot to say about whether we get a lot of this done,"" Biden said. White House chief of staff Ron Klain said the key to any outreach is that the proposal’s ideas are already popular. Americans want smooth roads, safe bridges, reliable public transit, electric vehicles, drinkable water, new schools and investments in manufacturing,         among the plan's many components, he said. “We kind of think it’s just right,"" Klain said in a televised interview with the news organization Politico. ""But we’re happy to have a conversation with people, less about the price tag, more about what are the elements that should be in the plan that people think are missing.” Those conversations could be limited to Democrats as McConnell declared: “I’m going to fight them every step of the way."" Biden told his Cabinet at its first meeting that he is enlisting several of them to help with the push: Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. “Working with my team here at the White House, each Cabinet member will represent me in dealings with Congress, engage the public in selling the plan and help organize the details as we refine it and move forward,"" Biden said. The task will involve lots of salesmanship for a legacy-making piece of legislation that Biden announced in a Wednesday speech. “Changes in my plan are certain,” Biden acknowledged on Friday, “but inaction is not an option.” His administration must sway Congress. It needs to rally voters. It’s also looking to outside economists to back the plan. It’s monitoring Wall Street for any celebrations or jitters. It’s forming alliances with advocates, while dealing with critics of the plan's corporate tax hikes and project details. And Biden's administration also intends, per the plan, to cajole other nations to stop slashing their own tax rates in what has been a race-to-the-bottom to attract and retain multinational businesses. Biden's vehicle for financing his infrastructure plans is a key dividing line. Republicans object to raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, one of the many changes so that business   would fund infrastructure. Republicans had cut the corporate rate from 35% in 2017, a hallmark policy achievement of  's presidency. Within Washington and corporate board rooms, the administration is attracting its share of accolades and rebukes on his proposal. In Biden's own party, liberal Democrats in Congress want him to go bigger. And Democrats representing high-tax states want to remove a 2017 tax code change that limited deductions of state and local taxes for individuals. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed no qualms about the proposal's scope. “It was in the tradition of America -- to think big,” Pelosi said at a press conference Thursday. “And now, in this century, President Biden is undertaking something in the tradition of thinking big, being transformational and creating jobs for America.” While many leading business groups oppose the higher taxes, some major companies see reason for optimism because of the innovations that would be encouraged by the plan. Automakers Ford, General Motors and Toyota endorsed the general concepts of Biden’s plan, which calls for the construction of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 in what would be a shift away from gasoline-powered cars. But some environmentalists said the plan's shift away from fossil fuels that cause climate change was not substantial enough. “Biden has pledged to cut carbon emissions 50% and decarbonize our electricity sector, but this proposal won’t even come close,"" said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. The White House was quick to address the climate change concerns. Climate adviser Gina McCarthy said the administration expects the infrastructure package to include Biden’s pledge to set a national standard requiring utilities to produce 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The proposed electricity standard “is going to be fairly robust, and it’s going to be inclusive,’’ McCarthy said. “I think we can get to the results that we’re looking for in a number of different ways. If a clean energy standard can be done, we think it should be done.’’ For every criticism of the plan's details, there were also plaudits for its broader approach. Harvard University economist Larry Summers, a former treasury secretary, endorsed Biden's plan, after previously criticizing the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan because of its size and debt-based financing. He downplayed any risks from corporate tax hikes, since low interest rates mean the costs of obtaining capital are already low for many companies. “I am excited,” Summers said on Twitter. “The economy's capacity will go up.” The plan also carries a political dimension as organized labor is mobilizing to get the package passed, an important push given the steady, recent Republican gains among working class voters. Biden's plan, with its focus on construction and manufacturing jobs, has the potential to reverse some of that slide — and the unions that backed him in 2020 are promising to help deliver votes on infrastructure. “Our members are an army a half-million strong, that will make calls, visit members of Congress and rally for good jobs building our nation’s infrastructure,"" said Terry O’Sullivan, general president of Laborers International Union of North America, one of the largest construction trades unions. ""We did it with boots on the ground to get President Biden elected.” ——— AP reporters Darlene Superville, Zeke Miller, Matthew Daly and Tom Krisher contributed to this report."
"Even with pretax profits, many big companies pay zero US tax",business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pretax-profits-big-companies-pay-us-tax-76842308,"NEW YORK -- Just as President Joe Biden is pushing to raise   on companies to help pay for his infrastructure plan, a report from a Washington policy group is highlighting how many firms pay zero despite making big pretax profits. More than 50 of the largest U.S. companies paid nothing in federal income   last year, with many getting rebates, even though they reported almost $40.5 billion in pretax profits as a group, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The group believes the tax system needs to raise more tax revenue. The 55 companies named in          the report issued Friday cross many industries, from agriculture to high tech, and they include such big names as Nike and Duke Energy. The report says the companies took advantage of breaks that were preserved or expanded under President  's 2017 overhaul of the tax code, as well as the economic rescue package that Washington passed last spring. Under the 2017 tax cut, the rate on corporate profits is 21%. But companies can use many tools to avoid taxes, such as writing off expenses related to the stock options they give their CEOs and other executives. Companies can also use a suite of available tax credits by making investments that the U.S. government is trying to encourage, similar to how individuals can get tax breaks for saving in a retirement fund or making their home more energy efficient. At Duke Energy, one of the nation's largest utility owners, the company recorded $110 million in tax credits last year for producing renewable energy through wind facilities, for example. That and other credits helped the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company net a $281 million rebate for federal income taxes last year, after reporting $826 million in pretax U.S. income from continuing operations. “Lawmakers developed these tax policies to encourage corporate taxpayers to make investments in economic growth, infrastructure and renewables,” Duke spokesperson Catherine Butler said. She said federal tax rules allowed Duke to delay some cash payments for taxes into the future, but not eliminate them. The company had about $9 billion in deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2020, which Butler said will become future tax payments over time. Nike, meanwhile, used a federal tax credit meant to encourage corporate research and development. The athletic apparel giant also took tax benefits related to share-based compensation for its fiscal year that ended on May 31. Altogether, it received $109 million in federal tax rebates after reporting total pretax income of $2.9 billion for the year. Officials at Nike, which is based in Beaverton, Oregon, could not be immediately reached for comment. “Most CEOs of large, publicly trade corporations are not going to risk prison to get out of paying taxes when Congress provides them with so many legal ways to do so,” said Steve Wamhoff, director of federal tax policy at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The $2.2 trillion rescue package that Washington approved last spring to ease the pain caused by the pandemic opened more avenues for companies to limit their federal tax bills. The law allowed corporations to takes losses reported in 2018 through 2020 and use them to reduce tax liabilities from earlier years, even ones where income was taxed at higher rates. “When President Trump signaled his intention to cut corporate taxes in 2017, he and Congress had an opportunity to pare back the many loopholes that have allowed companies to avoid tax on much of their income since the early 1980s,” the authors of the report, Wamhoff and Matthew Gardner, wrote. “But now, with three years of data published on the effective tax rates paid by publicly traded companies, it is clear that the Trump law has not meaningfully curtailed corporate tax avoidance and may even be encouraging it.” Corporations altogether paid nearly $243 billion in total tax receipts in 2019, down 30% from five years earlier. One of every three corporations with more than $1 billion in assets paid zero in federal income taxes from 2013 through 2017, according to a report prepared last year by the staff of the House of Representatives’ joint committee on taxation. For smaller companies, with less than $1 billion in assets, two out of three companies have zero federal income tax liability in a given year. In 2019, corporate taxes made up 3.9% of total U.S. tax revenue, according to the Tax Foundation, a group that wants tax policies that lead to greater economic growth. That compares with an average of 9.6% across the economies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That figure could rise if Biden can push through the changes to corporate taxes he's suggested to help pay for his          $2.3 trillion plan to renew the nation's infrastructure. A proposal to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% may not make much of a difference for the companies using tax credits and other tools to avoid paying any tax. But Biden's plan to enact a 15% minimum tax on the income that corporations report to their investors, known as book income, could force some zero-tax corporations to start paying, depending on how it's done. Republicans in Congress have also already resisted corporate tax increases, saying they would hurt the U.S. economy. ——— Sweet reported from Charlotte, North Carolina."
Traffic jam eases further in Suez Canal after ship unblocked,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/traffic-jam-eases-suez-canal-ship-unblocked-76832227,"CAIRO -- The maritime traffic jam on both ends of the Suez Canal eased further on Friday, four days after the dislodging of a massive containership that had blocked the waterway, authorities said. On Monday, salvage teams freed the skyscraper-sized Ever Given, ending a crisis that had clogged one of the world’s most vital waterways and halted billions of dollars a day in maritime commerce. At the time, canal officials said that more than 420 ships had been waiting for the Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned ship to be freed so they could make the crossing. Lt. Gen. Osama Rabie, head of the Suez Canal Authority said 80 cargo ships carrying carrying a total load of 4.7 tons transited through the canal on Friday, including the American aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. “This proves the global maritime community has great faith in the Suez Canal and Egypt's ability to guarantee safety and security to different types of vessels,” Rabie was quoted in a statement. Earlier, Leth Agencies said that a total of 357 vessels have crossed the Canal since the ship was re-floated by a flotilla of tugboats, helped by the tides. The number of vessels waiting to transit fell to 206 on Friday, the company said, from over 300 earlier in the week. The Ever Given had crashed into a bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez. That forced some ships to take the long, alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip — a 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) detour that costs ships hundreds of thousands of dollars in fuel and other costs. Others waited in place for the blockage to be over. The unprecedented shutdown, which raised fears of extended delays, goods shortages and rising costs for consumers, added to strain on the shipping industry, already under pressure from the coronavirus pandemic."
Dutch halt AstraZeneca coronavirus shots in under-60s,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/dutch-halt-astrazeneca-coronavirus-shots-60s-76835491,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Dutch government said Friday it is temporarily halting AstraZeneca   vaccinations for people under 60 following reports of very small number of people suffering unusual blood clots after receiving the shot. The Dutch decision comes three days after authorities in         Germany also stopped using the AstraZeneca’s vaccine in the under-60s, also citing fresh concerns over unusual blood clots reported in a tiny number of those who received the shots. Earlier Friday, a Dutch organization that monitors vaccine side effects said it had received five reports of blood clots with low blood plate counts following vaccinations. All the cases occurred between seven and 10 days after the vaccinations and all the people affected were women aged between 25 and 65 years. The organization said in the period when the five cases were reported, some 400,000 people were vaccinated in the Netherlands with the AstraZeneca shot.

Global stocks rise; Treasury yields rally after jobs report,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/asian-shares-higher-sp-500-tops-4000-points-76830202,"NEW YORK -- Stocks rose in many of the markets worldwide that were open on Good Friday, while Treasury yields rallied after a report showed U.S. employers added hundreds of thousands more jobs last month than economists expected. The U.S. bond market closed early after an holiday-shortened session that saw the yield on the 10-year Treasury climb to 1.72% from 1.68% late Thursday. It's been rising sharply this year on expectations that a supercharged economic recovery and higher inflation are on the way due to COVID-19 vaccinations and massive spending by the U.S. government. The yield began the year close to 0.90%. In Asia, stocks in Tokyo, Seoul and Shanghai all rose a day after the S&P 500 passed the 4,000-point level for the first time. Many major  s were closed in observance of Good Friday, including in New York and much of Europe. Futures for U.S. stock indexes rose, suggesting the S&P 500 may add to its record when trading resumes on Monday. Friday morning's U.S. jobs report was highly anticipated, and investors hoped it would show their expectations for a strong economic recovery were warranted. Hiring blew past expectations, with employers adding 916,000 more jobs than they cut last month. Economists had forecast growth of 617,500. It was nearly double the jobs growth from February, and it was the strongest since August. The data helped S&P 500 futures climb 0.4%, following the 1.2% rise for the index on Thursday to an all-time high. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq 100 also climbed. “This is about as clear as it gets, the reopening is happening faster than nearly anyone expected,” Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, said in a statement. He also pointed to how the U.S. government said hiring in January and February was stronger than earlier estimated. The numbers reassured investors that a sustained recovery appears to be taking root as more people get vaccinated and businesses reopen. So too did a corner of the jobs report showing workers' wages aren't jumping yet, even as hiring accelerates. Average hourly earnings dipped 0.1% in March from a month earlier, on a seasonally adjusted basis. While that's frustrating for workers, it encourages investors who had worried that a burst of inflation may be on the way. If inflation were to shoot higher and remain there, it would likely send Treasury yields spiking even higher. Higher interest rates make investors less willing to pay high prices for stocks, particularly those seen as the most expensive. They also hurt stocks of companies asking investors to wait many years for big profit growth to come to fruition. Such worries have hurt the momentum for big technology stocks in particular this year. Helping to counterbalance such concerns in the   this year has been immense spending by the U.S. government, which investors expect to help boost corporate profits. President Joe Biden unveiled details of his latest push earlier this week, a $2.3 trillion plan to shore up the nation's infrastructure. In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.6% to 29,854.00 on Friday. The Kospi in South Korea added 0.8% to 3,112.80, and stocks in Shanghai picked up 0.5% to 3,484.39. —— AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed."
CEO of Google's self-driving car spinoff steps down from job,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/ceo-googles-driving-car-spinoff-steps-job-76840526,"SAN RAMON, Calif. -- The executive who steered the transformation of Google's self-driving car project into a separate company worth billions of dollars is stepping down after more than five years on the job. John Krafcik announced his departure as CEO of Waymo, a company spun out from Google,         in a Friday blog post that cited his desire to enjoy life as the world emerges from the pandemic. “I'm looking forward to a refresh period, reconnecting with old friends and family, and discovering new parts of the world,"" Krafcik, 59, wrote. Two of Krafcik's top lieutenants will replace him as co-CEOs. Dmitri Dolgov, who has been working on self-driving cars since Waymo began within Google in 2009, will focus on the technology for the autonomous vehicles. Tekedra Mawakana, a lawyer who had been Waymo's chief operating officer, will handle the business side of the operation. Krafcik will remain an adviser to Waymo, a company that established itself as the clear leader in autonomous driving since Google hired him in 2015. Not long after that, Google's self-driving division morphed into Waymo, a company owned by Alphabet, which is also Google's parent. Under Krafcik's leadership, Waymo forged partnerships with several major automakers and launched the first ride-hailing service to pick up passengers without a driver or anyone else in the vehicles. That service, called Waymo One, only operates in the Phoenix metropolitan area, but Waymo plans to expand into other markets as the company continues to refine a technology that is expected to transform the auto industry. Waymo's inroads have left it with an estimated market value of about $30 billion, based on analyst estimates made last year         after the company raised $2.25 billion  in its first round of investments from outside Alphabet. Waymo subsequently received $1 billion from outside investors to close that round of financing. But last year's estimated $30 billion valuation was down dramatically from 2018 when a Morgan Stanley research report estimated Waymo was worth about $175 billion. The huge swing reflects the challenges of building self-driving cars that can navigate the roads safely while still dealing with traditional vehicles under the control of humans. That task has proven far more difficult than Waymo and dozens of other companies working on self-driving technology envisioned five or six years ago. For all its progress in autonomous driving, Waymo isn't believed to have ever made money during Krafcik's reign. Waymo doesn't disclose its financial results. It operates within an segment of Alphabet called “Other Bets"" that includes several other far-flung projects financed by the huge profits generated from Google's digital advertising empire. Alphabet's “Other Bets"" have lost nearly $13 billion during the past three years."
"Biden aims to juice EV sales, but would his plan work?",business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/biden-aims-juice-ev-sales-plan-work-76827906,"DETROIT -- Dangling tax credits and rebates in his drive to fight climate change, President   wants you to trade your gas-burning car, truck or SUV for a zero-emissions electric vehicle. Some buyers would find his offer persuasive. Yet Biden's goal is a daunting one: Even if Congress approves his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan, along with its incentives, it would take many years to replace enough internal combustion vehicles with EVs to make a huge dent in tailpipe emissions. Right now, there are about 279 million vehicles on the road in the United States. The proportion that are fully electric, according to IHS Markit, is 0.36%. Of the 14.5 million new vehicles that were sold last year, 2% were fully electric. Even if every new vehicle sold were battery powered — something no one envisions — it would take about 15 years to swap out the entire fleet. What's more, cars built during the past two decades last far longer than previous vehicles, so buyers are keeping them longer. The average U.S. vehicle has been on the road for nearly 12 years. Research shows that each EV sold does cut emissions. But it could take a couple of years for an EV to reach that point if coal is used to generate power to recharge the vehicle, said Bruce Belzowski, a retired University of Michigan transportation researcher who runs a company that studies the auto industry's future. “If you don't start somewhere, you're never going to get anywhere,” Belzowski said. “Every electric vehicle that you sell is going to be net positive for the environment.” The Biden administration didn't offer specifics on just how much car buyers would receive to trade in their vehicles. But it plans to spend $174 billion over eight years on EVs. That figure includes incentives for consumers, grants to build 500,000 charging stations, and money to develop U.S. supply chains for parts and minerals needed to make batteries. “We're going to provide tax incentives and point-of-sale rebates to all American families,” Biden said Wednesday. The biggest incentive likely will be expansion of the electric vehicle tax credit, now $7,500, which is phased out after an automaker sells 200,000 battery-electric vehicles. Tesla and General Motors have exceeded the cap. Nissan is getting close. A summary of Biden's plan didn't have any numbers. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, though, are backing a bill that would raise the cap to 600,000. The bill also includes a tax credit of at least $1,250 for those who buy used EVs. Jeff Schuster, president of global forecasting for LMC Automotive, an industry consulting firm, said that either the administration doesn't yet have specific numbers or deliberately omitted them while negotiations take place among the auto industry, Congress and environmental groups. “They know there's going to be some level of compromise needed,” he said. The form and size of the rebates also were not detailed. But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has proposed large discounts to those who buy American-made EVs — a possible reprise of the 2009 “Cash for Clunkers” program that offered $4,500 rebates for people to trade in less-efficient vehicles. The rebates and charging stations address two key reasons why many consumers are wary about switching to electric vehicles, Schuster said. Combined, he predicts that the incentives would help elevate EV sales from about 358,000 this year to over 1 million by 2023 and up to 4 million by 2030. If Biden's plan succeeds and EV sales take off, shortages of computer chips, metals used to build batteries, and a lack of battery factory capacity could leave the industry falling behind buyer demand, at least for a couple of years, Schuster said. David Kirsch, a professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland, said the Biden plan isn't really a tipping point that will turn consumers from combustion to electric vehicles. “There will be some good changes that will happen because of the scale of this investment, and those should not be minimized,"" Kirsch said. “I think electrification was coming anyway.” Indeed, the industry already was spending billions to develop EVs. LMC Automotive said 22 new electric models are coming out this year. A 2018 study by Alix Partners found that the global auto industry would spend $255 billion on EVs by 2023. At the same time, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that represents General Motors, Ford, Toyota and most major automakers, wrote in a letter to Biden that despite battery costs declining, EVs still are more expensive than combustion vehicles. The group, joined by the United Auto Workers union and a parts supply association, is urging the government to help address the difference. It is seeking tax credits, research spending and requirements to replace the federal fleet with electric vehicles. Even with such added spending, people in general will likely drive less in the future, because in the aftermath of the pandemic, many companies will allow a combination of work from home and office work. That will make some people even more reluctant to replace their vehicles, Schuster said. Yet Kirsch says that no matter how effective Biden's plan is or isn't in fighting climate change, the spending on modernizing the transportation fleet and infrastructure is long overdue. “What we're doing is playing catch-up on some long-delayed investment,” he said."
Young professionals cut ahead of older Italians for vaccine,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/young-professionals-cut-ahead-older-italians-vaccine-76850400,"ROME -- Octogenarians in Tuscany watched in disbelief and indignation as lawyers, magistrates, professors and other younger professionals got vaccinated against COVID-19 before them, despite government pledges of prioritizing  ’s oldest citizens. Even some of their adult children jumped ahead of them. By one estimate, the failure to give shots to the over-80s and those in fragile health has cost thousands of lives in a country with Europe’s oldest population and its second-highest loss of life in the pandemic. As the elderly were elbowed aside, a dozen prominent senior citizens in Tuscany published a letter calling out the authorities, including the region's governor, for what they said was a violation of their health care rights enshrined in the Italian Constitution. “We asked ourselves, ‘What’s the reason for this disparity?’” said signatory Enzo Cheli, a retired constitutional court judge who is a month shy of 87. By late March, he still hadn't been vaccinated, three months into Italy’s inoculation campaign. “The appeal was born of this idea that errors were being made, abuses,’’ Cheli said in a telephone interview from his country home near Siena. He noted that investigations are underway in Tuscany and other regions where professionals received priority status. Those over 80 in Tuscany have the lowest vaccination rate nationally. Another signatory was 85-year-old editorial cartoonist Emilio Giannelli, who hasn't been vaccinated, while his son, a lawyer, has. A Giannelli cartoon appeared on the front page of Corriere della Sera depicting a young man in a business jacket kicking an old man leaning on a cane out of a vaccine line. In a country where many citizens have learned not to count on often weak national governments, outsize influence is wielded by lobbying groups, sometimes derided as “castes.” Premier Mario Draghi has decried such “contractual clout,” saying last month that the “basic line is the need to vaccinate the most fragile people and the over-80s.” His government insists that vaccinations proceed in descending order by age, with the only exceptions being school and university employees, security forces, prison personnel and inmates, and those in communal residences such as convents. According to a calculation by the ISPI think tank, opening vaccination rolls to younger Italians cost 6,500 lives from mid-January through March, a period in which nearly 28,000 died. ISPI researcher Matteo Villa said any decision to vaccinate non-health care professionals who face infection risks should have been limited to those 50 and older. “If we give 100   to people over 90, we save 13 lives,"" Villa said in a phone interview, citing mortality rates. “But it takes 100,000   to 20- to 29-year-olds to save just one life.” The current average age of pandemic dead in Italy is 81. Throughout the pandemic, the oldest Italians have made up the majority of deaths, and not just in Tuscany. Just before Draghi sounded the alarm about lobbying groups, journalists in the small region of Molise had been poised to get early vaccinations. In Lombardy, veterinarians were given priority. In Campania, the region including Naples, drug company salespeople got priority status. Regional leaders blame vaccine delivery delays, alleging the previous government's vaccine rollout opened the door to lobbying groups. Some regions like Lazio, which includes Rome, resisted their pressure. By the end of March, nearly 64% of those 80 and older in Lazio had received at least one COVID-19 shot, compared with 40% in Tuscany. Speaking about society's most fragile, Lazio Gov. Nicola Zingaretti told the Corriere della Sera newspaper: “It's true everyone risks getting COVID, but the difference is that they are among those who, if they catch it, risk dying more than others."" Of Italy's 4.4 million residents 80 or older, fewer than 29% had been vaccinated, and another 27% had gotten only the first dose by the end of March, said the GIMBE foundation, which monitors health care in Italy. That compares with 95% of that age group in Malta who have received at least one dose, and 85% in Finland, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Italy. In Britain, where the vaccine rollout began roughly a month before the EU's, most of the over-50s have received at least one dose. GIMBE official Renata Gili linked much of Italy's uneven performance to varying organizational capabilities as well as “an excess of autonomy in regions in the choice of priority categories to vaccinate.” Some lobbying groups aren't backing down. The National Magistrates Association, which represents most of Italy’s more than 9,600 magistrates, threatened to further slow down the snail-paced judicial system if they aren't given priority. On Thursday, the tourism lobby demanded priority vaccines for its workers, describing them as essential to the country's recovery. On Friday, a top Health Ministry official, Giovanni Rezza, sought to cut off any more jockeying for priority. “There was a struggle between categories'' to get vaccine priority, Rezza told a news conference when asked if supermarket clerks could get special status. “We said, ‘Let’s finish the teachers, the security forces, but let's not have any more categories.' We simply will use criteria of age.” The army general who was tapped last month by Draghi to shake up Italy's COVID-19 vaccination campaign acknowledges its widespread problems. “Is everything going well? No,’’ Gen. Francesco Figliuolo told reporters Wednesday in Milan. Just how many people in Italy received priority vaccines isn't known. Tuscany's health commission office said that before Draghi pulled the plug on special interest groups, 10,319 lawyers, magistrates, courthouse clerks and personnel had received a dose in the region. Allowing lawyers and others to have quick access to vaccines is “an issue, and everyone is pissed off about it,’’ said Nathan Levi, an antiques dealer in Florence who turns 83 next month and is still waiting. “That’s what Italy is all about. The people who put the pressure” get ahead. Of the 10.6 million doses so far administered in Italy, around 1.6 million went to people categorized as ’’other,” prompting some politicians to demand to know who they are. When questioned, Figliuolo’s office admitted it has no idea and said it was pressing the regions for specific details. Italians in their 70s, who are largely out of the workforce, are still waiting for their shots. By March 31, only 8% had received a first dose and fewer than 2% had received both. Then there are people in fragile health, who have a priority category on the government's rollout chart. “The situation for the ‘fragile’ is one of huge uncertainty,’’ said Francesca Lorenzi, a 48-year-old lawyer in Milan with breast cancer. She noted that if cancer patients have finished therapy more than six months ago, they are no longer considered “fragile.” “Meanwhile, they gave doses of Pfizer to 60-year-olds in great health because they have university contracts. I don’t understand why a university professor or a lawyer should get vaccinated before the others,” she said. ——— Colleen Barry reported from Milan.

AP PHOTOS: Spain's Seville settles for subdued Easter Week,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/ap-photos-spains-seville-settles-subdued-easter-week-76850504,"SEVILLE, Spain -- Few Roman Catholics in devout southern   would have ever imagined an April without the pomp and ceremony of Holy Week processions. With the   pandemic unremitting, they will miss them for a second year. The streets of Seville and other Spanish cities again went without Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday and Good Friday celebrations marking the life, death and resurrection of Christ. The infection rate for COVID-19 is still too high for groups to be allowed to gather. For 50-year-old Roberto Ruiz, the extravagant Semana Santa, or Holy Week, processions mark the cycle of time in Seville. Without them, he feels unsettled. “You don’t fully wake up if Palm Sunday isn't celebrated,” he said. “The year neither begins nor ends. This is like being trapped in Groundhog Day. Every day is the same as the rest. The feeling is that of a year which has been lost.” In Spain, the virus has claimed tens of thousands of lives, destroyed hundreds of thousands of jobs, and jolted even the most fervently maintained traditions. Before the pandemic, Seville would be awash with Easter week crowds gathering to see Catholic brotherhoods hoist “pasos” adorned with Jesus, the Virgin Mary and other figures of the Passion onto their backs and slowly trudge through the streets. The burden of the porters carrying the manual floats contrasts with the beauty of the painted wooden statues; their struggle is joined with the other's glory. This week, Seville residents made do with Mass at the local parish church. They lined up to get inside and had to wear masks and keep a safe distance apart. The Rev. Francisco Ortiz, a priest in Seville’s Nuestra Señora de La Candelaria parish, hopes that faith can ease the physical, emotional and material pain caused by the yearlong virus crisis. “This celebration is bittersweet,” Ortiz said. “We are happy to be able to celebrate Mass together once again. It is a joy that helps us live with the anguish and bitterness that has made many people’s lives worse. There are many people in this neighborhood who are poorer than ever.” The absence of the thousands of tourists who normally flock to Seville has forced merchants with businesses built around the processions to adapt. “For our business, the cancellation of Easter Week festivities has been a disaster,” said Inmaculado Serrano, who makes embroidered embellishments for the outfits worn by brotherhood members. “We have been able to keep the shop open thanks to having reinvented ourselves into makers of face masks."" María Morilla said she was grateful simply to have made it to another Easter. “Easter Week is about more than just the processions,"" she said. ""We Catholics and members of the brotherhoods are people who know how to wait.” ——— Joseph Wilson contributed to this report from Barcelona."

EXPLAINER: What we know about the Amazon union vote count,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/explainer-amazon-union-vote-count-76852833,"If you want your bottle of laundry detergent or shipment of toilet paper,   can get it to your doorstep the next day. But if you want to know how workers at an   warehouse voted on whether or not to unionize, you're going to have to wait. The final day for the nearly 6,000 workers in Bessemer, Alabama to cast their ballots was March 29. But it could take several more days or even weeks to review and tally everything before we know the outcome. The vote itself has garnered national attention because of the potentially wide-reaching implications. Labor organizers hope a win in Bessemer will inspire thousands of workers nationwide — and not just at Amazon — to consider unionizing. For Amazon, it would mean a big blow to its profits and could alter its business operations. Here's what we know about the vote: WHAT DO ORGANIZERS WANT? Besides higher pay, they want Amazon to give warehouse workers more break time and to be treated with respect. Many complain about their back-breaking 10-hour workdays with only two 30-minute breaks. Workers are on their feet for most of that time, packing boxes, shelving products or unpacking goods that arrive in trucks. WHAT’S AMAZON’S RESPONSE? Amazon argues the warehouse created thousands of jobs with an average pay of $15.30 per hour — more than twice the minimum wage in Alabama. Workers also get benefits including health care, vision and dental insurance without paying union dues, the company said. HOW ARE THE VOTES BEING TALLIED? The National Labor Relations Board, which is overseeing the process, is going through the votes with representatives from Amazon and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. Names and signatures are being reviewed, but not how those workers voted, which will be done afterwards in an anonymous tally. Voters put their ballots in two envelopes to keep the vote secret. Amazon or the retail union could contest those votes for various reasons, such as the person no longer works at the warehouse or has a job title that disqualifies them. Any contested votes will be set aside and remain unopened. Then, the other “yes"" or “no"" votes will be counted. Members of the media will be able to watch that count through a livestream. Which side wins is determined by a majority of the votes cast. WHEN WILL WE KNOW THE RESULTS? That part is still unclear. A lot depends on how many people voted. The NLRB has not released a figure on the number of ballots submitted, nor how many have been contested so far. If the number of contested votes are enough to change the final outcome, hearings may be held to have those votes counted. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE UNION WINS? Amazon would need to start negotiating a contract with the New York-based RWDSU, which is leading the organizing efforts for Bessemer warehouse employees and represents 100,000 workers at poultry plants; cereal and soda bottling facilities; and retailers such as Macy’s and H&M. But the company could file objections to the vote or start legal battles, delaying the contract negotiations by weeks, months or even longer. In the past, labor experts said employers have done all kinds of things to not recognize a union, including closing stores or warehouses. In 2005, for example, Walmart closed a store in Canada where some 200 workers were close to winning a union contract. At the time, Walmart said demands from union negotiators made it impossible for the store to sustain itself. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE UNION LOSES? The retail union could file unfair labor practice charges against Amazon based on the company's conduct during the election to influence the outcome. Under that scenario, the union says the NLRB would schedule a hearing and determine if the election results should be set aside because the employer “created an atmosphere of confusion or fear of reprisals"" for workers. If that happens, the election results may be overturned or another election takes place. ————— Follow Joseph Pisani on Twitter: @         josephpisani"
The push to diversify banking from within the industry ,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/push-diversify-banking-industry/story?id=76568426,"The racial reckoning in America calling for diversity has touched every industry including banking. According to a report from the   -- a bank workers' advocacy group -- Black and Latino employees have a significantly smaller chance of holding an executive position in corporate banks in comparison to their white counterparts. ""I heard lots of stories of workers of color who said, 'I've applied for 15 jobs, 20 jobs, never got an interview, I always had good, performance reviews by my manager ...  but never got an interview,'"" Nick Weiner the lead author of the CBB report told ABC News. The report finds that Black and Latino employees at 13 major U.S. banks have a less than 25% chance of being promoted or hired for a senior management or executive position in comparison to their white colleagues. Black and Latinos also have a very high likelihood of being in an entry-level position with limited mobility, such as bank teller and call center employees in comparison to their white colleges, the report also found. The study gave the financial industry a ""C"" grade for diversity. African American and Latino representation were given a ""D"" and Asian representation, a ""C."" A lack of diversity in corporate America is nothing new, but the impact is even more widespread in banking. African Americans and Hispanics are less likely than their white counterparts to receive home mortgages, personal loans and are more likely to lack trust in banking and lack banking access and resources. Reese Giddins, the co-founder and CEO of  , Bank who worked in corporate banking for several years before helping to start minority-focused and owned bank Greenwood, said the lack of diversity may contribute to the lack of trust in financial institutions from minorities. ""When you don't have people that look like you, that can't understand you, and can't help you, it's hard to build that trust. With Greenwood, we're trying to rebuild that trust in our community along with the recirculation of the dollars into the community as well as bringing in that talent,"" Giddins told ABC News. Many banks including those studied in the CBB report released statements following the death of George Floyd, promising to diversify and provide racial equity. However, further steps to diversify the industry are needed, said Wells Fargo employee Ted Laurel. ""I would say that we would need more change beyond just adding more ranks of minorities into our leadership ... A two-prong approach would definitely help moving the employees up from the bottom that we already have, and then also recruiting more diverse talent, especially from those minority colleges,""  Laurel said. A number of banks including US Bank and Wells Fargo were given an ""F"" grade in the report. According to the report authors, these banks declined to provide its researchers with data on ""the total number of employees within race groups at the company."" A spokesperson from Wells Fargo told ABC News, the company has work to do with improving diversity, but is making strides. ""Wells Fargo is committed to doing the work to ensure we provide our employees with an inclusive and respectful workplace where diverse talent flourishes. While we have more work to do, we have taken steps that include creating a diverse segments, representation and inclusion group reporting directly to the CEO that is accountable for progress and execution of new and existing programs, conducting diversity-focused talent reviews and sponsorship programs to help promote underrepresented groups, assessing senior leaders on increasing diverse representation at leadership levels, and requiring unconscious bias training for all managers. We are committed to sharing results,"" Well Fargo told ABC News via a statement. ""In 2020, we broadly disclosed our EEO-1 data for the first time, and we intend to publish our 2019 and 2020 Consolidated EEO-1 gender/race employment data in the summer of 2021 as part of our updated ESG reporting process. Wells Fargo values diversity and inclusion not just as a business imperative, but because it's the right thing to do,"" Wells Fargo senior vice president Kate Pulley also said in a statement to ABC News.  has also recently hired Kleber Santos in November of 2020, to lead Diverse Segments, Representation & Inclusion to improve internal diversity and equity. US Bank employee Marcus Dodson said transparency is needed to fully see how the issue is being resolved. ""What I would like to see is transparency ... a focus on diversity. From what I've seen, we've had these trainings that we take online. I would say that there hasn't been a focus on minority hiring, minority issues or having difficult conversations,"" Dodson said US Bank declined ABC News' request for an interview but released the following statement: ""The findings in this report are not accurate and do not reflect information we've released publicly, including in our 2020 Environmental, Social and Governance Report, which is available on our  ,"" US Bank vice president Lee Henderson said in a statement. According to its Social and Governance report, US Bank has committed to $100 million annually in access to capital for Black business owners, and provided $1 million to Black-led community development financial institutions. Greenwood, which Giddins says officially will launch this summer, is one of those Black-led community development financial institutions, and US Bank is one of Greenwood's investors, he said. However, Reese is hoping the partnership from their investors which he said also includes Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Chase, leads to more than just financial gains.

The Latest: Italy enters strict 3-day lockdown over Easter,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/latest-germany-faces-crisis-trust-amid-pandemic-76850837,"ROME — Italy has entered a three-day strict nationwide lockdown to deter Easter travel and help prevent new surges of the coronavirus. Even though the Health Ministry says the rate of infections is coming down, all regions were placed into the strictest “red zone” lockdown through Monday as a precaution. The lockdown, announced last month, means restrictions on personal movement, with limited travel and visits to relatives. Non-essential shops are closed and restaurants and bars are only open for take-out. Police set up road checks to ensure people were staying close to home. Extra patrols were ordered up to break up large gatherings in squares and parks, which over Easter weekend are usually packed with picnic goers. Italy, where the European outbreak began, has recorded 3.6 million cases and more than 110,000 deaths from the coronavirus, more deaths than any other European country but Britain. It has administered 10.8 million vaccines, though only 3.3 million of the country’s 60 million people have received both doses. ——— THE VIRUS OUTBREAK: —           for vaccine — UK regulator reports           linked to AstraZeneca shot — Ukraine hits daily high of 20,000 virus cases — AP PHOTOS: Spain’s Seville settles for          ——— Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at          ,           and          ——— HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING: SAN FRANCISCO -- Volunteers in California are working to ensure thousands of farmworkers who daily toil in the fields are receiving coronavirus vaccinations. Farmworkers are particularly vulnerable because they live in crowded housing and travel to farms in packed vehicles. Officials say most farmworkers are eager to get the vaccinations but may not have the ability to sign up online. California was the first state to make agricultural workers eligible for vaccinations, followed by others including Washington, Michigan and Georgia. Arizona hasn’t prioritized farmworkers, but some private growers have offered vaccinations. California is the nation’s top producer of fruits and vegetables, and its growers rely on the labor of as many as 800,000 farmworkers. Some arrive under the H2A visa program that allows employers to hire them legally, but many are hired regardless. Researchers at Purdue University estimate about 9,000 agricultural workers in the U.S. have died of the coronavirus and nearly a half million have been infected. ——— KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine recorded a new daily high of more than 20,000 coronavirus cases. Health Minister Maxim Stepanov says 20,341 new infections were registered in the previous day, nearly 500 more than the record on Friday. Ukraine began vaccinations late February, but only about 230,000 people have received the shots because of widespread reluctance. The sharply rising numbers prompted the mayor of the capital Kyiv to order schools and public transportation closed for two weeks starting Monday. Overall, more than 1.7 million infections and 34,000 confirmed deaths have been recorded during the pandemic. ——— HARRISBURG, Pa. — Vaccine passports developed to verify COVID-19 immunization status have become the latest flash point for some U.S. politicians. Supporters say the passports would allow inoculated people to more freely travel, shop and dine. But Republicans portray them as a heavy-handed intrusion into personal freedom and private health choices. Vaccine passports currently exist in only one state -- a limited government partnership in New York with a private company. Vaccine passports are typically an app with a code that verifies whether someone has been vaccinated or recently tested negative for the coronavirus. They are used in Israel and under development in parts of Europe, considered a way to safely help rebuild the pandemic-devastated travel industry. They are intended to allow businesses to safely open as the vaccine drive gains momentum. They mirror measures already in place for schools and overseas travel that require proof of immunization against various diseases. ——— ISLAMABAD — Pakistan federal authorities will start coronavirus vaccinations for residents over 80 on Monday. The country received 60,000 doses of the CanSino vaccine from China early in the week. Pakistan is already using the Sinopharm vaccine, donated by Beijing last month. The National Command and Control Center says the vaccine administration will begin in all the four provinces for people over age 80. Pakistan reported 4,723 new coronavirus cases and 84 confirmed deaths in the last 24 hours. The country is facing a virus surge, which the government says is worse than last year’s outbreak when a nationwide lockdown was imposed. Pakistan has reported a total of 68,288 cases and 14,697 confirmed deaths. ——— DHAKA, Bangladesh — Bangladesh authorities are imposing a one-week nationwide lockdown on Monday to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Cabinet Minister Obaidul Quader announced the plan on Saturday. The government says 5,683 new infections and 58 deaths were recorded in the last 24 hours. Forhad Hossain, the country’s junior minister for public administration, says organizations providing emergency services will be available during the lockdown. He says industries will remain open and employees must work in shifts, following health guidelines. The government has already banned travel from all European countries, except the United Kingdom, and 12 other countries for three weeks. Bangladesh has registered a total of 630,277 cases and 9,213 confirmed deaths. Health experts say the actual number is likely higher. ——— PARIS — French hospitals brought in extra staff for the Easter holiday weekend to cope with more coronavirus patients. With a new virus variant spreading fast and French intensive care units as full as they were last April, the government closed all schools and imposed new rules taking effect nationwide on Sunday. In Paris, police say they’re deploying 6,600 officers to enforce the new restrictions, which include a ban on traveling more than 10 kilometers (6 miles), a ban on outdoor gatherings of six people or more and a continued nationwide 7 p.m. curfew. On the Mediterranean shores of Marseille, police patrolled amid sunbathers and fined people drinking in public or not wearing masks. Crowds filled Paris-area train stations on Friday night to head to the countryside. The SNCF national rail authority says its expecting 600,000 people to travel over the weekend. France has registered 4.8 million coronavirus cases, the most in Europe and fourth globally. It’s confirmed more than 96,000 deaths, eighth highest in the world. The U.S. leads with 30.6 million cases and more than 554,000 confirmed deaths. ——— BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Argentine President Alberto Fernández says he had an initial positive test for coronavirus, despite having been vaccinated in January. Fernández sent a tweet Friday saying took a quick antigen test for the virus after feeling a headache and fever. He says other than light symptoms, he is “physically well” and isolating. He adds he’s awaiting a confirmation of the result using a more rigorous PCR test. The president received a dose of the Sputnik V vaccine on Jan. 21 and a second dose a few days later. The Russian Gamaleya Institute, which produced the vaccine, tweeted the shot has a 91.6% rate of effectiveness against infection and 100% against critical cases. “If the infection is confirmed and occurred, the vaccination assures a rapid recovery without severe symptoms,” it said. Argentina recently tightened border restrictions following a surge in cases. It has administered more than 4 million doses of vaccine. The nation of 45 million has registered nearly 2.4 million infections and 56,000 confirmed deaths. ——— LONDON — Britain’s medicines regulator is urging people to continue taking the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, despite revealing seven people in the U.K. have died from rare blood clots after getting the shot. The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, says it isn’t clear if the shots are causing the clots. It says its “rigorous review into the U.K. reports of rare and specific types of blood clots is ongoing.” Though the agency said late Friday that seven people had died as a result of developing blood clots, it didn’t disclose any information about their ages or health conditions. In total, MHRA says it's identified 30 cases of rare blood clot events out of 18.1 million AstraZeneca doses administered through March 24. Concerns over the AstraZeneca vaccine prompted some countries to restrict its use to older people. The World Health Organization has urged countries to continue using the shot. ——— NAIROBI, Kenya — Kenya has ordered a suspension on private importations of vaccines. The National Emergency Response Committee says the move is meant to ensure transparency and accountability in the process of vaccinations. Private health facilities have been charging about $80 for the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, while the governments institutions are giving free AstraZeneca vaccines received from the global COVAX initiative. In recent weeks, the Kenyan government has been on a sensitization campaign to reduce the reluctance of frontline workers to take the AstraZeneca vaccine. About 160,000 people have been vaccinated in more than a month since 1 million doses were received. President Uhuru Kenyatta on March 26 led his cabinet in getting vaccinated publicly after announcing stricter restrictions on movement and assembly due to a surge of coronavirus cases and deaths. Kenya’s government says the country’s positivity rate increased from 2.6% at the end of January to 19.1% on April 2. ——— FRANKFURT, Germany — Germany’s president says the country is enduring a “crisis of trust” as it weathers a second Easter under pandemic restrictions amid dissatisfaction over the government’s response. In the text of an address to be broadcast Saturday, Frank-Walter Steinmeier conceded “there were mistakes” regarding testing, digital solutions and vaccinations. He urged Germans not to wallow in the negative but to pull together and trust approved vaccines. Germany, along with the European Union as a whole, has lagged some countries in the speed of its vaccination effort amid the slower procurement of vaccines because of supply and distribution issues from the vaccine companies. He pointed out vaccine deliveries would increase sharply in the coming weeks and both citizens and government had to pull together and not “outdo each other in pessimism.” ——— ROME — Octogenarians in Tuscany watched in disbelief and indignation as lawyers, magistrates, professors and other younger professionals got vaccinated against COVID-19 before them, despite government pledges of prioritizing Italy’s oldest citizens. Even some of their adult children jumped ahead of them. By one estimate, Italy’s failure to prioritize the over-80s and those with fragile health conditions has cost thousands of lives in a country with Europe’s oldest population and its second-highest loss of life in the pandemic. As the elderly were elbowed aside, a dozen prominent senior citizens in Tuscany published a letter calling out the authorities for what they said was a violation of their health care rights enshrined in Italy’s Constitution. ——— SEVILLE, Spain — Few Roman Catholics in devout southern Spain would have imagined an April without the pomp and ceremony of Holy Week processions. With the coronavirus pandemic unremitting, they will miss them for a second year. The streets of Seville and other Spanish cities again went without Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday and Good Friday celebrations marking the life, death and resurrection of Christ. The infection rate for coronavirus is still too high for groups to gather. For 50-year-old Roberto Ruiz, the extravagant Semana Santa, or Holy Week, processions mark the cycle of time in Seville. Without them, he feels unsettled. “You don’t fully wake up if Palm Sunday isn’t celebrated,” he said. “The year neither begins nor ends. This is like being trapped in Groundhog Day. Every day is the same as the rest. The feeling is that of a year which has been lost.” ——— SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s daily increase in coronavirus infections exceeded 500 for the fourth straight day, a pace unseen since January, as experts raise concern about another viral surge amid a slow rollout in vaccines. The 543 new cases reported by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on Saturday brought the national caseload to 104,736, including 1,740 deaths. More than 320 of the new cases came from the Seoul metropolitan area, home to half of the country’s 51 million people, where officials have struggled to stem transmissions tied to various places, including bars, offices, factories, schools, and gyms. Health authorities this week said they are considering whether to approve rapid coronavirus tests that would allow people to regularly test themselves at home as they look for further tools to fight the virus. South Korea has wrestled with a slower rollout of vaccines than many other developed economies, with officials insisting they could afford a wait-and-see approach as its outbreak isn’t as dire as in the United States or Europe. ——— SAN FRANCISCO — California cleared the way for people to attend indoor concerts, theater performances and NBA games for the first time in more than a year as the rate of people testing positive for the coronavirus in the state nears a record low. State officials won’t require testing or proof of vaccination for some of those events, but they do limit the number of people allowed to attend. Events that do require testing and vaccinations will be allowed to have more paying customers than those that don’t. Only people who live in California can attend these live performances. The rules are different for private indoor gatherings, including weddings, meetings or conferences. Those are only to be allowed if all guests test negative for the coronavirus at least 72 hours in advance or show proof of full vaccination. ———"
UK: Benefits outweigh risks for AstraZeneca despite 7 deaths,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uk-regulator-reports-30-clot-cases-linked-astrazeneca-76850734,"LONDON -- Britain’s medicines regulator is urging people to continue taking the AstraZeneca   vaccine, despite revealing that seven people in the U.K. have died from rare blood clots after getting the jab. The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, said it wasn't clear if the shots are causing the clots, and that its “rigorous review into the U.K. reports of rare and specific types of blood clots is ongoing.” Though the agency said late Friday that seven people had died as a result of developing blood clots, it didn’t disclose any information about their ages or   conditions. In total, MHRA said it had identified 30 cases of rare blood clot events out of 18.1 million AstraZeneca doses administered up to and including March 24. The risk associated with this type of blood clot is “very small,” it added. “The benefits of COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca in preventing COVID-19 infection and its complications continue to outweigh any risks and the public should continue to get their vaccine when invited to do so,” said Dr. June Raine, the agency’s chief executive. Concerns over the AstraZeneca vaccine have already prompted some countries including Canada, France, Germany and the Netherlands to restrict its use to older people. The U.K., which has rolled out coronavirus   faster than other European nations, is particularly reliant on the AstraZeneca vaccine, which was developed by scientists at the University of Oxford. It has also been using the vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, of which the agency has not seen any reported blood clot events. Figures Saturday showed that the U.K. has given a first dose of vaccine to 31.4 million people, or around 46% of its population, a much higher rate than the rest of Europe. Delivering second doses is the priority for April, with 5.2 million people now having received two jabs. The relative success of the country's vaccination program has been credited for helping to sharply reduce new coronavirus infections in the U.K. after a winter surge, paving the way for a modest easing of lockdown restrictions on gatherings. On Saturday, the U.K. recorded another 3,423 infections, slightly up on the previous day's six-month low of 3,402. It also recorded only 10 coronavirus-related deaths, its lowest daily total since early September. Despite the improved coronavirus backdrop, the U.K. has recorded Europe’s highest COVID-related death toll, with over 126,500 deaths. In France, which has restricted use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to people over 55, the family of a 38-year-old woman who died after suffering post-vaccination blood clots in the brain filed a criminal complaint in Toulouse on Saturday seeking a manslaughter investigation. She is among four people in France who died after suffering blood clots in the weeks after getting an AstraZeneca vaccine shot. France’s national medicine safety agency says it is investigating those cases and eight other cases of severe blood clotting in people who survived. MHRA's view about the relative benefits of the vaccine is shared by the European Medicines Agency. It has said a causal link between unusual blood clots in people who have had the AstraZeneca vaccine is “not proven, but is possible,"" and that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks of side effects. The World Health Organization has also urged countries to continue using the jab. Adam Finn, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Bristol, said the “extreme rarity” of the blood-clotting events in the context of the millions of jabs administered in the U.K. makes the decision very straightforward. “Receiving the vaccine is by far the safest choice in terms of minimizing individual risk of serious illness or death,” he said. ——— Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report. ——— Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak"
Pressure mounts on corporations to denounce GOP voting bills,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pressure-mounts-corporations-denounce-gop-voting-bills-76848495,"ATLANTA -- Liberal activists are stepping up calls for corporate America to denounce Republican efforts to tighten state voting laws, and businesses accustomed to cozy political relationships now find themselves in the middle of a growing partisan fight over voting rights. Pressure is mounting on leading companies in         Texas, Arizona and other states, particularly after         Major League Baseball’s decision Friday to move the 2021 All-Star Game out of Atlanta. A         joint statement  from executives at nearly 200 companies, including HP, Microsoft, PayPal, Target, Twitter, Uber and Under Armour, took aim at state legislation “threatening to make voting more difficult"" and said “elections are not improved” when lawmakers impose new barriers to voting. The outcry comes a week after         Georgia Republicans enacted an overhaul of the state's   law that critics argue is an attempt to suppress Democratic votes. Other companies have, somewhat belatedly, joined the chorus of critics. Delta Air Lines and The Coca-Cola Co., two of Georgia’s best-known brands,         this past week called the new law “unacceptable,"" although they had a hand in writing it. That only angered Republicans, including Gov. Brian Kemp and several U.S. senators, who accused the companies of cowering from unwarranted attacks from the left. The fight has thrust corporate America into a place it often tries to avoid — the center of a partisan political fight. But under threat of boycott and bad publicity, business leaders are showing a new willingness to enter the fray on an issue not directly related to their bottom line, even if it means alienating Republican allies. “We want to hold corporations accountable for how they show up when voting rights are under attack,” said Marc Banks, an NAACP spokesman. “Corporations have a part to play, because when they do show up and speak, people listen.” Kemp said at a news conference Saturday that baseball “caved to fear and lies from liberal activists” and moving the game means ”cancel culture” is coming for American businesses. Kemp said state leaders worked in good faith with leaders in the business community on the legislation, including some of the same companies that have now “flip-flopped on this issue.” He added: “We shouldn’t apologize for making it easy to vote and hard to cheat."" Civil rights groups have sued to block the new Georgia law, which was passed after Democrats flipped the once-reliably Republican state in an   that Donald Trump falsely claimed was rife with fraud. Some activists have called for consumer boycotts of Delta, Coca-Cola and others. They dismiss business leaders’ assertions that they helped water down the bill to ease earlier, more restrictive proposals; those leaders, they argue, should have tried to block the plan altogether. In Texas, the NAACP, League of Women Voters and League of United Latin American Citizens, among other organizations, are urging corporations in the state to speak out against a slate of Republican-backed voting proposals. “Democracy is good for business,” the campaign says. Nine organizations took out full-page ads in The Houston Chronicle and The Dallas Morning News, the state’s leading newspapers, urging corporate opposition to the plan. The Texas proposal would limit some early voting hours, bar counties from setting up drive-thru voting and prohibit local officials from proactively sending applications for mail ballots before voters request them. Unlike their Georgia-based counterparts, American Airlines and Dell Technologies didn’t wait for the Texas measure to pass. “To make American’s stance clear: We are strongly opposed to this bill and others like it,” American said in a statement. Arizona, which Biden flipped from Trump in November, hasn’t seen high-profile corporate players engage yet. But 30-plus groups sent a joint letter to Allstate Insurance, CVS Health and Farmers’ Insurance, among others, urging their public opposition to proposed voting restrictions. Emily Kirkland, executive director of Progress Arizona, a progressive group that signed the letter, said there's been no response yet. Other groups are demanding that corporations focus on Washington, where         congressional Democrats are pushing measures intended to make it easier for Americans to vote, regardless of state laws. Among the changes, Democrats would enact automatic voter registration nationally and standardize access to early and mail voting. Democrats also want to restore parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that require the federal government to approve all election procedures in states and locales with a history of discrimination. The Supreme Court struck down those provisions, which applied to Georgia and Arizona, among other states, in 2013. Corporate giants were mostly quiet when Trump falsely claimed he lost because of fraud. Business leaders largely maintained that caution as Republican state lawmakers used Trump's lie to justify a flood of new bills to make it more cumbersome to vote. The reticence was a stark contrast to how chambers of commerce reacted six years ago when Republican-run states pushed “religious freedom” measures. Indiana, under then-Gov. Mike Pence, the future vice president, saw immediate corporate backlash. After North Carolina passed a “bathroom bill” limiting LGBTQ rights in 2016, PayPal scuttled expansion plans there and the         NBA moved its all-star game from Charlotte.         An AP analysis in 2017 found the reaction would eventually cost North Carolina at least $3.76 billion in lost business. Then, Georgia’s corporate lobbying groups — with Delta’s and Coca-Cola’s backing — took no such chances, speaking out forcefully against Georgia conservatives' version of a “religious freedom” bill. Lawmakers passed it anyway but Kemp’s predecessor,         Republican Nathan Deal, vetoed it amid the chamber outcry. Today, Delta and Coca-Cola's response to the Georgia voting fight is standing as a cautionary tale for other businesses. Ed Bastian, the airline’s chief executive, initially released a statement noting the business lobby’s role in altering the bill as it moved through the General Assembly. Officials at the Atlanta Metro Chamber, where Bastian currently serves as president, detailed how corporate lobbyists spent weeks at the Capitol on mitigating provisions. Some Georgia Republicans wanted to roll back the state’s no-excuse absentee voting law, end automatic voter registration and ban Sunday early voting used heavily by Black churches. They also wanted to require photocopies of state IDs to receive and submit absentee ballots, while banning “drop boxes” as ballot collection receptacles. The final law preserved no-excuse absentee voting and automatic registration. The new ID requirement for absentee ballots allows a voter to write their state ID number, rather than produce a photocopy, and the legislature included funding for free state IDs. The law also codifies in-person early voting on weekends, although it allows counties to choose whether to be open for voting for up to two Sundays. And it made drop boxes of mail ballots a permanent fixture in Georgia, but limited the number. Business leaders’ philosophy, according to Democratic state Sen. Jen Jordan, was “basically, Republicans are going to pass something, so they might as well try to keep from being awful.” But by Wednesday, the same day 72 Black business executives published a letter in The New York Times urging corporate leaders to speak out, Bastian was more direct. He sent a companywide memo declaring the law “unacceptable” and “based on a lie” — though he didn’t mention Trump. Big business’s mistake, Jordan said, was “thinking there was ever any version that wouldn’t end up like this.” ——— Associated Press writers David Koenig in Dallas; Acacia Coronado and Paul J.

Amazon apologizes to congressman for bogus ‘peeing’ tweet,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/amazon-apologizes-congressman-bogus-peeing-tweet-76854324,"NEW YORK -- Amazon is sorry for tweeting about peeing. The company apologized in a late Friday         blog post for a tweet it sent to a congressman more than a week ago denying that its employees work so hard they must urinate in empty water bottles. It also admitted that some delivery drivers might have had to urinate in bottles and it vowed to improve their working conditions. The matter was first raised March 24 by   U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, who responded to a tweet by an   executive that said the company was a progressive workplace. “Paying workers $15/hr doesn’t make you a ‘progressive workplace’ when you union-bust & make workers urinate in water bottles,” Pocan said in his         tweet. Amazon         responded: “You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us.” In the Friday night blog post,   apologized to Pocan and acknowledged that delivery drivers “can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes.” The online shopping giant said COVID-19 has made the issue worse, since many public restrooms are closed. “Sigh,” Pocan responded in a Saturday morning         tweet. “This is not about me, this is about your workers—who you don’t treat with enough respect or dignity.” Amazon wrote in its blog post that urinating in bottles is an industry-wide problem. To try and prove its point, it shared links to news articles about drivers for other delivery companies who have had to do so. “Regardless of the fact that this is industry-wide, we would like to solve it,” the company said. “We don’t yet know how, but will look for solutions.” Amazon's treatment of workers has been a hot topic recently as it faces the         biggest union push in its history at an Alabama warehouse. Organizers there are pushing for more break time and better pay, with many complaining about the back-breaking 10-hour workdays that include only two 30-minute breaks. Seattle-based Amazon didn’t respond to a request for comment. ————— Follow Joseph Pisani on Twitter: @         josephpisani"
Italy enters 3-day Easter lockdown amid vaccination snags,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/italy-enters-day-easter-lockdown-amid-vaccination-snags-76855617,"ROME -- Italy entered a three-day nationwide coronavirus lockdown Saturday to deter Easter travel and get-togethers even as the country's variant-fueled spike in new infections began to wane. The government had announced last month that it would place all regions into the strictest “red zone” lockdown over the Easter weekend to limit the chances of contagion, taking the same precautions it enforced over Christmas and New Year’s. Travel between regions and visits to relatives were being limited through Monday. Nonessential shops were closed and restaurants and bars were only open for take-out. “People are tired, but they are aware that protecting health is essential in these times,” said Maj. Fabio Palletta, a Carabinieri military police officer manning a checkpoint in Rome on Saturday, one of many set up around the country this weekend to ensure people on the roads were authorized to travel. The Interior Ministry also ordered up extra foot police patrols to break up large gatherings in squares and parks, which over Easter are usually packed with picnic-goers. “I’m glad they are doing checks. It means something is working in this whole mess,” said Amato Monatanari, who was pulled over for a check in Rome. Italy, where Europe's outbreak began, has recorded more than 110,000 COVID-19 dead, more than any other European country but Britain. Another 21,000 infections were reported Saturday in  , along with 376 dead. An estimated 87% of  ’s newest cases have been traced to the highly contagious variant first detected in Britain. But the Health Ministry reported Friday that for the second week in a row, new cases had “slightly diminished.” But because Italian hospitals in most regions are still well over their COVID-19 capacity in both intensive care units and other wards, the ministry concluded that new infections were still “too high ... to allow any reduction in current restrictive measures.” Italians, however, are upset over the country's stumbling vaccination campaign, which despite having promised to prioritize older people has left          many of Italy's eldest, most vulnerable people behind while teachers, police officers and other professional workers get their jabs. The Lombardy region, Italy’s biggest, has          suffered more COVID-19 infections and deaths than any other but still has had a faltering vaccination campaign, earning a personal visit this week from Italy’s new virus czar, Gen. Francesco Figliuolo. “There are things that aren’t going well,” Figliuolo said. “We’ll note them, and then we’ll fix them together.” More than three months into Italy’s nationwide vaccination campaign, Lombardy this week opened a new centralized appointment portal after its previous system sent some elderly people hundreds of kilometers (miles) from home to get a jab and left others unable to get an appointment. Lombardy’s embattled regional governor, Attilio Fontana, acknowledged “some difficulties” but insisted that they hadn’t impacted the overall vaccination campaign. He said the criticism of the regional effort was “nauseating.” Italy has administered 10.8 million   nationwide, though only 3.3 million of the country’s 60 million people have received both doses. Lombardy, which counts one sixth of the population and has long prided itself on its health care system, has administered 1.7 million doses. On Saturday in Sicily, a church opened its doors temporarily to become a pop-up vaccination center. “For those who are Christians celebrating Easter, today means above all to be a good and honest citizens,” said the Rev. Michele Viviano, parish priest of the Salesian parish of Don Bosco in San Gregorio di Catania, Sicily. “This means also cooperating with the immunization campaign, participating in it and organizing it,” he said. ——— Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic,         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine and         https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak"

Lombardy’s embattled regional governor, Attilio Fontana, acknowledged “some difficulties” but insisted that they hadn’t impacted the overall vaccination campaign. He said the criticism of the regional effort was “nauseating.” Italy has administered 10.8 million   nationwide, though only 3.3 million of the country’s 60 million people have received both doses. Lombardy, which counts one sixth of the population and has long prided itself on its health care system, has administered 1.7 million doses. On Saturday in Sicily, a church opened its doors temporarily to become a pop-up vaccination center. “For those who are Christians celebrating Easter, today means above all to be a good and honest citizens,” said the Rev. Michele Viviano, parish priest of the Salesian parish of Don Bosco in San Gregorio di Catania, Sicily. “This means also cooperating with the immunization campaign, participating in it and organizing it,” he said. ——— Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic,         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine and         https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak"
"New to DC, Buttigieg looks to build bridges with Biden plan",business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/dc-buttigieg-build-bridges-biden-plan-76864685,"WASHINGTON -- Pete Buttigieg was a few weeks into his job as   secretary, buried in meetings and preparing for the launch of President  ’s $2.3 trillion public works plan, when evening arrived along with a time to try something new in Washington. Instead of climbing into the back seat of a black SUV like most Cabinet secretaries, he headed to a bike-share rack. Helmet on, and with a couple of Secret Service agents flanking him, he pedaled the mile-long trip to his home in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. It wasn't a one-time stunt. On Thursday, Buttigieg arrived at the White House for a Cabinet meeting on his two-wheeler. And that wasn't his only “regular guy” moment. Dog park devotees in the District of Columbia have also seen him there, chatting up anyone from children to members of Congress such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Buttigieg first had his eye on the job of the man who is now his boss, Biden.         Buttigieg's presidential campaign was surprisingly successful — he essentially tied for first with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Iowa caucuses and finished a close second to him in the New Hampshire primary — and he made a strong impression as someone who represented the future of the Democratic Party. Now the man known during his campaign as “Mayor Pete"" — he was the mayor of South Bend, Indiana — faces the first test of that potential in his first job in Washington: leading a Cabinet department with a $75 billion annual budget and a mandate to help spur an infrastructure program that Biden has likened to the the building of the interstate highway system in the 1950s. He will have to navigate the complicated politics of both an entrenched bureaucracy at the Transportation Department and the fraught politics of a bitterly divided Washington. He may have found a way by just riding a bike, which has gained fans from even skeptics in Congress. “You've got to keep your head up,” Buttigieg told The Associated Press, explaining the path and potential dangers posed from unaccustomed drivers, but he said it can be a much quicker journey from point A to B. Biden on Thursday tasked Buttigieg and four other Cabinet members — the “Jobs Cabinet” — with selling the administration's infrastructure and climate plan, a flood of money for roads, bridges, airports, broadband communications, water systems and electric cars. But the plan has already hit a wall with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who objects to the corporate tax increases Biden says will pay for the plan and pledges to oppose it “every step of the way.” On the other side, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, says the package should be significantly larger. Daunting as it may seem, the challenge of helping build consensus fits the ambition of the man who had the audacity to run for president from the perch of being mayor of a midsize town in Indiana. When Biden selected the smooth-talking Naval reserve veteran for the   post, he praised him as offering “a new voice with new ideas determined to move past old politics.” In an interview, Buttigieg said he believes that bipartisan consensus is attainable. Joining Buttigieg in selling the plan are Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. “I’ve had enough conversations, especially the one-on-one conversations away from the cameras with members from both sides of the aisle, to know there really is a sincere interest in getting this done,” Buttigieg told the AP. “Now politics can get in the way of that of course. But I think unlike a lot of other issues where there is just deep passionately felt profound disagreement about what to do, here there’s a really healthy overlap in terms of our ideas about what has to happen, even if there is a lot of difference on how to get there.” Translation? Republicans like smooth roads and fast internet for their constituents, too. But so far, there is no indication Republicans share his position. The proposal offers big stakes for Buttigieg at the department, where he pledges to promote public transit and other green alternatives to gas-guzzling cars and apply an “equity lens” to infrastructure projects. “Black and brown neighborhoods have been disproportionately divided by highway projects or left isolated by the lack of adequate transit and transportation resources,” Buttigieg tweeted in December. Under Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, he said, ""we will make righting these wrongs an imperative.” Just two months into the job, Buttigieg has met with two dozen House members and 13 senators and in recent days has upped that pace, talking to lawmakers both parties every day. Republicans describe the former McKinsey consultant as likable and open-minded, even if they wonder at times about his actual level of sway on legislation. Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis, the top Republican on a key panel overseeing highways, said he’s talked with Buttigieg twice, once at a meeting with Biden and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House. He called the conversations “really good.” “I’m very excited to be able to work with him,” said Davis, a cyclist back home in his rural district, who thinks the former mayor can bring a valuable street-level perspective to filling potholes and easing congested streets. “If he wants to go for a ride to discuss bike lanes and public transit, I’d welcome that,” he said. Though the youngest Cabinet member at age 39, Buttigieg possesses a star power matched by few others in the group. He's displayed an ability to command media attention and use those moments — including during a series of memorable Fox News hits around the election — to sway the public, including those not always apt to vote Democratic. He’s spoken at the popular SXSW conference in Texas, joined Gov. Ralph Northam, D-Va., to promote expanded passenger rail, and tweets at a frequency to a wider public that comes close to rivaling Donald Trump when he was president. Buttigieg promotes transit policy both on his official and personal account, where he also expresses devotion to his husband, Chasten. Buttigieg, who owns two dogs, has even been seen at a neighborhood park with Ocasio-Cortez. A chance meeting, he said. The new transportation secretary had one recent stumble: He had to quickly walk back a plan to charge drivers per mile they drove. It's a proposal that has some support among Republicans but could violate Biden's campaign pledge not to raise taxes on people earning less than $400,000. Buttigieg has impressed West Wing aides with his work ethic and willingness to learn, and he was quickly granted approval to pursue a robust engagement with the media. The president’s advisers also hold warm feelings toward the former mayor for his decision last spring to quickly endorse Biden after abandoning his own campaign, helping accelerate the end of the Democratic primary contest. And Biden has compared Buttigieg to his late son Beau, a powerful evocation that helped cement his importance to the president. Now bound to Biden’s agenda and performance, Buttigieg begins a phase likely to enhance his public service portfolio — and life experience. This phase accomplishes what some allies have said Buttigieg needed, a next chapter, beyond the underdog story of the boy wonder from the small Midwestern city. Friends and advisers had long suggested that he get out of South Bend and see more of the world than his seven-month deployment to Afghanistan in 2014 allowed. Buttigieg was also busy taking steps toward running for president when he got married in June 2018 and when his father died six months later. During the campaign, he said he and Chasten had hopes of becoming parents. Asked about his desire to be a father, Buttigieg told the AP “we’re still working at that,” before adding with a smile, “Stay tuned.” As quickly as he rose, Buttigieg swiftly suspended his campaign in March 2020, before Biden's ascension in the primary was clear. He knew when to get out. He'll probably know when to get back in, too, if he does. “He has incredible political talent and skill,” said Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, a longtime friend and 2020 campaign supporter. “But part of that talent and skill is having really great political timing.” On that front, she sees his work on infrastructure not as ""part of this grand plan on his next move,” but rather as a demonstration of his ability to focus on the task at hand. Buttigieg and his husband have been spotted walking around their new neighborhood, Capitol Hill, where they live in a one-bedroom apartment, meandering the artisanal stalls at Eastern Market to smiles from residents. Last weekend, they wandered along the brick row houses and blooming magnolia cherry blossom trees, greeting neighbors with waves and allowing young children to pet their dogs. Their one-eyed puggle named “Buddy,” adopted in late 2018, has become something of an Instagram star. Buddy lingered as a blond-haired little girl ran up and sat to snuggle him while the other lab mix, Truman, stood nearby. “He loves the attention,” Chasten Buttigieg explained to the girl, a trait Buddy picked up during the campaign. Pete Buttigieg smiled as the girl gave the dog a goodbye scratch on the head, and the couple slowly made the way back on a path toward the Capitol. ——— Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

Supreme Court gives Georgia win in water war with Florida,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/supreme-court-georgia-win-water-war-florida-76810945,"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Florida's water lawsuit against Georgia on Thursday, ending the long-running legal fight between the two states. The court rejected Florida's claim that Georgia uses too much of the water that flows from the Atlanta suburbs to the Gulf of Mexico. Florida said that its neighbor's overconsumption is to blame for the decimation of Florida's oyster industry. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote for the court that Florida failed to prove its case, which had been before the court twice in the past three years. “Considering the record as a whole, Florida has not shown that it is ‘highly probable’ that Georgia’s alleged overconsumption played more than a trivial role in the collapse of Florida’s oyster fisheries,” Barrett wrote. The court's newest justice cautioned that she and her colleagues were not equipped to say what accounts for the steep decline in oysters from Apalachicola Bay. “Of course, the precise causes of the Bay’s oyster collapse remain a subject of ongoing scientific debate. As judges, we lack the expertise to settle that debate and do not purport to do so here,” Barrett wrote. And she also noted that, even with its high-court victory, “Georgia has an obligation to make reasonable use of Basin waters in order to help conserve that increasingly scarce resource.” The case involved the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers in Georgia, which join to form the Apalachicola River at the Florida line. Florida had sought a court order forcing Georgia to limit its use of water from the Flint. When the justices first heard the dispute three years ago, Florida also was claiming that the Atlanta area’s consumption of water from the Chattahoochee River played a big role in the reduced flows in Florida, but that claim fell out of the case by the time it reached the court again in February. Last year, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission voted unanimously to shut down oyster harvesting in Apalachicola Bay through the end of 2025 because of a dwindling oyster population. Florida’s lawsuit against Georgia was filed directly in the Supreme Court, which is mainly an appellate court but hears disputes between states. The court appointed a special master to evaluate the case, and he initially recommended that Georgia should prevail."
"With ship now freed, a probe into Suez Canal blockage begins",business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/ship-now-freed-probe-suez-canal-blockage-begins-76764639,"SUEZ, Egypt -- Experts boarded the massive container ship Tuesday that had blocked Egypt's vital Suez Canal and disrupted global trade for nearly a week, seeking answers to a single question that could have billions of dollars in legal repercussions: What went wrong? As convoys of ships again began traveling through the artery linking the Mediterranean and Red Seas, a canal service provider said more than 300 vessels carrying everything from crude oil to cattle were still waiting for their turn in a process that will take days. Egyptian government officials, insurers, shippers and others similarly waited for more details about what caused the skyscraper-sized Ever Given to become wedged across the canal on March 23. When blame gets assigned, it will likely lead to years of litigation to recoup the costs of repairing the ship, fixing the canal and reimbursing those who saw their cargo shipments disrupted. Since the vessel is owned by a Japanese firm, operated by a Taiwanese shipper, flagged in Panama and now stuck in Egypt, matters quickly become an international morass. “This ship is a multinational conglomeration,"" said Capt. John Konrad, the founder and CEO of the shipping news website gcaptain.com. Experts boarded the Ever Given as it idled Tuesday in Egypt's Great Bitter Lake, just north of the site where it previously blocked the canal. A senior canal pilot, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to journalists, told The Associated Press that experts were looking for signs of damage and trying to determine why the vessel ran aground. There could be significant damage to the the ship, Konrad warned. Stuck for days across the canal, the ship's middle rose and fell with the tide, bending up and down under the tremendous weight of some 20,000 containers across its 400-meter (quarter-mile) length. On Monday, when workers partially floated the ship, all that pressure came forward to its bow. “Structural integrity is No. 1. You know, there was a lot of strain on that ship as it was sagging in the waterway,” Konrad said. “They have to check everything for cracks and particularly that rudder and the propeller in the back that’s connected to the engine room.” ""And then they have to go through all the mechanical equipment, make sure they test the engines, all the safety valves, all the equipment, and then determine that it’s safe to sail either by itself or with a tug escort to the next port,” he added. The ship's owner, Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., said Tuesday that it would be part of the investigation along with other parties, though it did not identify them by name. It also refused to discuss possible causes of the grounding, including the ship's speed and the high winds that buffeted it during a sandstorm, saying it could not comment on an ongoing investigation. Initial reports also suggested a “blackout” struck the vessel, something denied by the ship's technical manager. The company added that any damage to the ship was believed to be mostly on its keel. It said it was not immediately known whether the vessel will be repaired on site in Egypt or elsewhere, or whether it will eventually head to its initial destination of Rotterdam. That is a decision to be made by its operator, rather than the shipowner, the company said. The Ever Given was seen to be stationary in the canal lake from the town of Fayed on Tuesday, still stacked with containers, with a specialist tugboat nearby. Other vessels in transit navigated around it. The grounding of the ship had halted billions of dollars a day in maritime commerce. Analysts expect it could take at least another 10 days to clear the backlog — though Egypt's president said Tuesday it would take just three. The losses to shippers, as well as any physical damage to the vessel itself, likely will see lawsuits. Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd. is covered with some $3 billion in liability insurance through 13 Protection & Indemnity Clubs. Those clubs are not-for-profit mutual insurers used by the vast majority of global shipping firms. Global legal firm Clyde and Co. said the Ever Given's owner likely would pay Egypt's canal authority for the assistance already rendered to the vessel. The authority also could fine the Ever Given. “We anticipate a detailed investigation will follow which will determine the cause,"" the firm said. ”Evidently the cause will impact upon the legal liabilities of the ship and cargo interests."" Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi traveled Tuesday to the canalside city of Ismailia to praise those who freed the vessel. Speaking to a small group of reporters on a dock overlooking the waterway, el-Sissi deflected questions about the investigation, saying Egypt would not interfere in a probe that will be left to “the specialists.” “We want to confirm to all the world, that things are back to as they were,” he added. He stood before a sign that said: ""Welcome to the Suez Canal: Egypt's lifeline of peace, prosperity and development."" On Monday, a flotilla of tugboats helped by the tides, wrenched the bulbous bow of Ever Given from the canal’s sandy bank, where it had been firmly lodged. The tugs blared their horns in jubilation as they guided the Ever Given through the water after days of futility that had captivated the world, drawing scrutiny and social media ridicule. The Ever Given had crashed into a bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez. That forced some ships to take the long, alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip — a 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) detour that costs ships hundreds of thousands of dollars in fuel and other costs. The unprecedented shutdown, which raised fears of extended delays, goods shortages and rising costs for consumers, added to strain on the shipping industry already under pressure from the coronavirus pandemic. ——— Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Landmark Amazon union vote count begins in Alabama ,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/landmark-amazon-union-vote-count-begins-alabama/story?id=76767505,"Vote counting began on Tuesday to determine if workers in Bessemer, Alabama, will form the first-ever labor union at an   warehouse in the U.S. The unionizing efforts at one of the largest employers in the nation has  , as many view the watershed vote as a keystone moment in the organized labor movement that has  . ""Amazon is such a huge player in the economy, and the tech sector hasn't been one that the union movement has much representation in at all,"" Alex Colvin, the dean of Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told ABC News Tuesday. ""It could be a real shift if we started to see organizing at Amazon."" Colvin said a union formation in Alabama could set a ""precedent"" and inspire other Amazon workers across the country to follow suit. ""Amazon has a lot of facilities around the country and a lot of employees,"" he added. ""If this is the start of a broader movement towards unionization at Amazon, that would be a big deal to the economy."" The National Labor Relations Board began tabulating the votes from some 5,800 workers at the Bessemer Amazon facility on Tuesday, though it is not immediately clear when the results for the vote are expected to come in. If successful, the warehouse workers will be represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). ""This campaign has already been a victory in many ways,"" RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement. ""Even though we don't know how the vote will turn out, we believe we have opened the door to more organizing around the country; and we have exposed the lengths to which employers will go to crush their employees trying to gain a union voice -- this campaign has become the prime example for why we need labor law reform in this country."" Colvin told ABC News that regardless of the way the vote turns out, ""We should anticipate a certain likelihood of an extended period of conflict over establishing collective bargaining at the workplace, we commonly see that after elections."" The Alabama workers' unionizing efforts have drawn support from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Last week, Sen.  , I-Vt., visited Alabama to meet with some of the workers involved in the unionizing efforts. ""All I want to know is why the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, is spending millions trying to prevent workers from organizing a union so they can negotiate for better wages, benefits and working conditions,"" Sanders tweeted ahead of his visit. His tweet drew ire from Amazon executive Dave Clark, who responded to Sander's tweet by noting that Vermont's minimum wage is $11.75 an hour compared to Amazon's $15, adding, ""The Sen should save his finger wagging lecture until after he actually delivers in his own backyard."" On the other side of the aisle, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has also publicly thrown his support behind the union in an   earlier this month. On the day voting began for the union,   on Twitter voicing his support for labor unions and encouraging workers to ""make your voice heard."" In response to a request for comment on the vote count commencing, Amazon told ABC News in a statement Tuesday that, ""RWDSU membership has fallen 25% during Stuart Appelbaum's tenure, but that's no justification for Mr. Appelbaum to misrepresent the facts."" The statement continued: ""Our employees know the truth -- starting wages of $15 or more, health care from day one, and a safe and inclusive workplace. We encouraged all of our employees to vote, and their voices will be heard in the days ahead."""
Georgia governor vows a fight after MLB yanks All-Star Game,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/georgia-governor-vows-fight-mlb-yanks-star-game-76856937,"News of Major League Baseball’s decision to pull this summer’s All-Star Game from Georgia over its sweeping new voting law reverberated among fans Saturday, while Gov. Brian Kemp vowed to defend the measure, saying “free and fair  s” are worth any threats, boycotts or lawsuits. The Republican governor said at a news conference that MLB “caved to fear and lies from liberal activists” when it         yanked the July 13 game from Atlanta’s Truist Park. He added the decision will hurt working people in the state and have long-term consequences on the economy. “I want to be clear: I will not be backing down from this fight. We will not be intimidated, and we will also not be silenced,” Kemp said. ""Major League Baseball, Coca-Cola and Delta may be scared of Stacey Abrams, Joe Biden and the left, but I am not,” he said, referring to companies that have also         criticized the new law. Three groups already have filed a lawsuit over         the measure, which includes new restrictions on voting by mail and greater legislative control over how elections are run. Critics say it violates the First and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well as parts of the federal Voting Rights Act that say states cannot restrict Black voter participation. The governor insists opponents have mischaracterized what the law does, yet Republican lawmakers made the changes largely in response to false claims of fraud in the 2020 elections made by former President Donald Trump and his supporters. The law includes a new photo ID requirement for voting absentee by mail and makes it a misdemeanor to hand out money or gifts, including food or drink, to those waiting in line, which Kemp said was done to prevent groups from trying to influence voters. The prohibition extends 150 feet from a polling place and 25 feet from any person standing in line. It also expands weekend early voting, although Republicans had earlier proposed limiting it. Abrams, who has         championed voting rights since narrowly losing to Kemp in the 2018 election, is among those who have spoken out against it. The Democrat is being closely watched to see if she seeks a 2022 rematch. Fans, meanwhile, appeared divided on pulling the game from Georgia. Patrick Smith, a lifelong Braves fan in Ellisville, Mississippi, said he thinks the league made the right decision and noted that not taking a stand would have polarized some supporters. “When governments restrict access to the ballot box, someone has to step in to encourage these entities to roll back those measures,"" he said. Lorre Sweetman, in Kahului, Hawaii, said it was a poor move by MLB because it wasn’t based on the actual new voting laws but on “political pandering” and misinformation. Still, while some fans upset about the decision have called for a boycott of professional baseball, she said she will not stop watching games and her three grandsons are still learning the sport. “They caved to pressure without considering the message this sends to fans who just want to enjoy the game and support their team,” she said. “We need to take politics out of sports.” But Dick Pagano, a baseball fan in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, said he will not watch or attend any games this year. “They shot themselves in the foot,"" said Pagano, who added he will be disappointed to miss the planned Hank Aaron celebration during the All-Star Game, since he once saw him play in the 1957 World Series. Aaron, who played for the Braves in Atlanta and Milwaukee for most of his career, faced extensive hate mail and racism as he closed in on breaking Babe Ruth’s home run record. Jeffrey Guterman, a retired mental health counselor in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, who calls himself an amateur baseball historian, said the decision shows baseball changing with the times. “I’m surprised when people argue that moving it away from Atlanta is a bad move because it would bring lots of money to the area,” he said. “The question is what costs more, moving the All-Star Game or reinforcing the oppression of votes.” The league did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred previously said he made the call to move the All-Star events and the amateur draft from Atlanta after discussions with individual players and the Players Alliance, an organization of Black players formed after the death of George Floyd last year. A new ballpark for the events wasn’t immediately revealed. Kemp also criticized the league for not trying to improve voter access in its home state of New York, where he said voters need an excuse to vote by mail and have fewer days of early voting than in Georgia. He said its decision means “cancel culture” is coming for American businesses and jobs. Trump also blasted the league's move, while former President Barack Obama congratulated MLB for its decision, saying there was no better way for baseball to honor Aaron, “who always led by example."" Meanwhile, Republican U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina said he’s asked his staff to begin drafting a bill to remove the league’s antitrust law exemption in response to the decision. “An overwhelming bipartisan majority of Americans support requiring an ID to vote, and any organization that abuses its power to oppose secure elections deserves increased scrutiny under the law,” he said in a tweet. Baseball antitrust exemptions, in place since a 1922 Supreme Court decision, primarily allow MLB to prevent franchise moves without owner approval. ——— Anderson reported from New York, and Willingham from Jackson, Mississippi.

"From child care to COVID, rising job market faces obstacles",business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/child-care-covid-rising-job-market-faces-obstacles-76853064,"WASHINGTON -- A surge in hiring in the United States last month —          916,000 added jobs, the most since August — coincides with growing confidence that a blistering pace of job growth will continue as vaccinations increase and federal aid fuels economic growth. The most optimistic economists even predict that between now and year’s end, the nation could produce as many as 10 million more jobs and restore the labor market to its pre-pandemic level. Maybe so. Yet even in normal times, it would be hard to regain all those jobs so quickly. And these aren't normal times. Many people who've been thrown out of the labor force remain fearful of the coronavirus and reluctant to take face-to-face service jobs. Millions of women are still caring for children attending school online — and can't take jobs because they can't find or afford child care. Extended unemployment aid has meant that some employers might have to pay more to attract workers, which they may feel unable to do. And some people will need new skills before they can land a job to replace the one they lost. While few doubt that the trillions in federal money flowing through the economy will help accelerate hiring, the challenges are sure to endure. Here's a look at some of them: ——— HEALTH FEARS For now, a sizable majority of Americans remain unvaccinated. And after weeks of sharp declines, the number of daily infections is creeping back up. Recruiters say that trend is discouraging some of the unemployed from taking jobs. “People are afraid to come to work — there is some of that,"" said Tammy Browning, president of KellyOCG, a staffing agency. Eventually, ongoing vaccinations ought to gradually reduce such fears, although a portion of Americans remain hesitant to get vaccinated. Browning also suggested that employers will need to become more creative about making workers feel comfortable on the job. Many of her firm's clients are manufacturing companies. On many hot factory floors, their employees have to wear masks and gloves for eight or more hours a day. Companies should consider providing more break times, Browning said, and allow workers to remove their masks outside or in socially distant break rooms. As a single mother, Jennifer Knapp of Augusta, Maine, worries about what a return to work would mean for her and her children's health. A year ago, Knapp, 44, lost her job as a receptionist at a hotel and spa, a place she described as a “hub of germs.” “There is work out there, if you want to put yourself at risk,” she said. But the open jobs she sees are typically temporary and offer low pay. Right now, Knapp is living off savings, child support payments from her ex-husband and unemployment aid. Like many parents, she'd like to find a work-from-home job, ideally in her field of psychology and social work. “The goal,"" she said, “is to get back out there and work, as long as my kids are doing OK.” ——— NEED FOR CHILD CARE Nearly 2.5 million women lost jobs and stopped looking for work during the pandemic. In most cases, experts say, it was because so many children were suddenly stuck at home, going to school online, and their parents lacked available or affordable child care. Better child care options or more flexible work schedules would be needed to fully reverse that trend. Some such change is becoming evident as schools and child care centers reopen. About 500,000 women returned to the labor force in March and found jobs. The improvement could continue in the coming months: Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, the job listings website, says job openings at child care centers are growing, a sign that more of these centers are back in business. Recruiters also say flexible or hybrid work schedules, along with benefits for part-time workers, may be critical in attracting job seekers, especially women. More companies could provide on-site child care. “I think it is going to require some systemic changes by employers,"" said Karen Fichuk, chief executive of Randstad North America, a recruiting firm. ——— EXTENDED JOBLESS AID Recruiters say the $300-a-week federal unemployment benefit that was provided by President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID aid package, on top of regular state jobless benefits that average about $340 a week, might have made it harder for some employers to find workers. For some job seekers, especially those fearful of the virus, part-time or temporary jobs at restaurants or stores that may pay less than their unemployment aid, aren't much of an alternative. Economic research suggests that unemployment benefits generally don't deter workers from taking jobs: A study by the         JPMorgan Chase Institute found that last year's federal unemployment payment didn't discourage recipients from working. But the new $300-a-week federal supplement is set to last six months — longer than the previous payment did. “It’s a much more attractive benefit now,"" said Julia Pollak, an economist at ZipRecruiter. ""It would be foolish to think that wouldn’t have any effect.” Economists have calculated that roughly half the unemployed are earning more from benefits than they did at their former jobs. Another factor is that jobless benefits normally require the unemployed to document their efforts to seek a job in order to remain eligible. But during the pandemic, most states have suspended this requirement. That means there is less incentive to job hunt. Browning said her firm is advising clients to pay more and offer other benefits, including bonuses, to offset the extended jobless aid. Six months ago, a client raised the hourly rate for a temporary position by $4 an hour. The proportion of jobs filled, she said, jumped from 35% to 98%. “You really have to encourage people to come back to work,"" Browning said, “and that means pay at the level the market is demanding.” ——— NEED FOR NEW SKILLS For some of the unemployed, their old job appears gone for good. In some cases, their former employers have learned to operate with fewer workers. Landing a job will require finding work in a new occupation or industry — perhaps only after obtaining job training. This takes time. Many economists expect more companies to help reskill workers themselves, particularly if they become desperate to hire. Should the unemployment rate keep declining, businesses might have little choice. “When the economy is running hot, businesses begin to increase training and take risks on someone they might not have hired in the past,” said Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody's Analytics. ——— OPTIMISM NEEDED For millions of Americans, the past year has meant demoralizing job losses — sometimes multiple layoffs — and fruitless job searches, leading many to give up on finding work. As an example, the number of people who said they want a job but were too discouraged to look for one in the past month didn’t change in March. That was true even though several job search websites report that job postings have risen sharply in recent weeks. For discouraged workers, Pollak said, it can take time to regain confidence. “There are many job seekers who haven’t yet realized how rapidly the conditions in the labor market have changed,” she said. “Many searched for work earlier during the pandemic, when it was most difficult and frustrating to do so, and are now discouraged.”"
Groups: Venice lagoon still at risk after cruise ship decree,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/groups-venice-lagoon-risk-cruise-ship-decree-76854068,"ROME -- Activists opposed to cruise ships in Venice are seeking a meeting with the Italian government to argue that its latest proposal to re-route big ships away from St. Mark’s Square doesn’t address pressing environmental concerns about the fragile Venetian lagoon. The Italian Cabinet passed a decree this week calling for a public tender of ideas to create a new docking port “outside the protected waters of the lagoon.” Culture Minister Dario Franceschini said the decree addresses longstanding UNESCO concerns and establishes that cargo and cruise ships bigger than 40,000 tons must dock outside the lagoon. While it’s not articulated in the decree, the temporary plan would have big ships use the Marghera Port on the Italian mainland until a definitive solution is found and implemented — a potentially years-long process. “Whoever has been to Venice in recent years, either an Italian or foreigner, has been upset seeing these ships — hundreds of meters long and high as a condo — pass by such fragile places as the Giudecca Canal or in front of St. Mark’s Square,” Franceschini said. He called the decree a “very important” way to come up with a definitive new solution. But the No Big Ships Committee, a coalition of activists, said the Marghera Port is still part of the Venetian lagoon and therefore must be rejected even as a temporary solution. The new route envisaged would take ships past the tail of the Lido and then hug the Italian mainland via the Oil Canal, away from Venice’s historic center but still into the lagoon and up to Marghera. “It’s certainly a relief to hear the Italian government finally state its intention to keep large ships out of the lagoon as well as block them from coming close to Venice,"" said Jane da Mosto of the We Are Here Venice group, which is part of the No Big Ships coalition. “But the interim ‘temporary’ plan to bring large cruise ships to Marghera will not protect the lagoon,” she said in an email. “This new route will still damage its fragile ecosystem, with inevitable negative knock-on effects."" The issue has simmered in Venice for years. The fragile Italian canal city depends tourism, even though the coronavirus pandemic has dealt a blow to that industry in the last year. But opponents of cruise ship tourism say the ships are out-of-scale for Venice, cause pollution, threaten the lagoon’s ecosystem and are a danger. To back up their claims, they cite the 2019 crash of a cruise ship on Venice's main Giudecca Canal that injured five people. The No Big Ships Committee said it was seeking a meeting with the government to argue that the Oil Canal route to Marghera “is not workable.” “Any temporary solution has to be rejected because the risk is too high that it becomes definitive,” the group tweeted. ——— Colleen Barry contributed from Soave, Italy."
Amazon apologies for 'incorrect' tweet that denied workers urinate in bottles ,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/amazon-apologies-incorrect-tweet-denied-workers-urinate-bottles/story?id=76855171," apologized for an ""incorrect"" reply to a U.S. congressman's tweet last week that criticized the online shopping giant's working conditions,   that its delivery drivers may have had to urinate in bottles. The apology stems from a March 24 tweet by Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., who said, ""Paying workers $15/hr doesn't make you a 'progressive workplace' when you union-bust & make workers urinate in water bottles."" About an hour and a half later, Amazon refuted Pocan's claim, replying in part: ""You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us."" Now, in a blog post Friday, Amazon apologized to Pocan, calling its reply an ""own-goal"" that was not properly vetted. ""It did not contemplate our large driver population and instead wrongly focused only on our fulfillment centers,"" Amazon wrote in the post. The tweet ""did not receive proper scrutiny,"" the company added. On the issue of drivers having to urinate in bottles, Amazon wrote that it knows that drivers ""can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes, and this has been especially the case during Covid when many public restrooms have been closed."" ""This is a long-standing, industry-wide issue and is not specific to Amazon,"" the post continued, with links to tweets and articles about other companies reportedly facing the same problem. ""Regardless of the fact that this is industry-wide, we would like to solve it. We don’t yet know how, but will look for solutions."" In response to the apology, Pocan tweeted, ""Sigh."" ""This is not about me, this is about your workers -- who you don't treat with enough respect or dignity,"" he said. Pocan's initial tweet came as Amazon workers at an Alabama fulfillment center were  . Vote counting began earlier this week to determine if the workers in Bessemer will form the first-ever labor union at an Amazon warehouse in the U.S. The results for the vote have not yet come in."
Facebook data on more than 500M accounts found online,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/facebook-data-500m-accounts-found-online-76858417,"NEW YORK -- Details from more than 500 million   users have been found available on a website for hackers. The information appears to be several years old, but it is another example of the vast amount of information collected by   and other social media sites, and the limits to how secure that information is. The availability of the data set was first reported by Business Insider. According to that publication, it has information from 106 countries including phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, and email addresses. Facebook has been grappling with data security issues for years. In 2018, the social media giant disabled a feature that allowed users to search for one another via phone number following revelations that the political firm   had accessed information on up to 87 million Facebook users without their knowledge or consent. In December 2019, a         Ukrainian security researcher reported finding a database  with the names, phone numbers and unique user IDs of more than 267 million Facebook users — nearly all U.S.-based — on the open internet. It is unclear if the current data dump is related to this database. “This is old data that was previously reported on in 2019,"" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement. “We found and fixed this issue in August 2019.”"
Kansas Jayhawks sign basketball coach Bill Self to lifetime contract,sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kansas-jayhawks-sign-basketball-coach-bill-lifetime-contract/story?id=76836712," coach Bill Self has signed a lifetime contract with the men's basketball team, the school announced Friday. Self's current contract, which had less than one year remaining, has been replaced with a new five-year rolling agreement that automatically adds one year at the conclusion of each season for the remainder of his career. ""I want to extend my sincere appreciation to Chancellor [Doug] Girod, Kurt Watson, and the rest of the leadership at KU for their belief and faith in me to provide this lifetime contract,"" Self said in a statement. ""Every day, I am reminded just how fortunate I am to lead this storied program and there truly is no place else I would rather be. As we continue to work through the challenges facing our program, we look forward to moving ahead and focusing on our bright future. I would also like to express my gratitude to our alumni and donors, as well as the best fans and students in the nation, that have supported my family and me for the past 18 seasons. I'm excited to remain your basketball coach and compete for many championships in the future."" Self has been in Lawrence since 2003, going to three Final Fours and winning a national championship in 2008. Kansas won 14 consecutive Big 12 regular-season titles under Self from 2005 to 2018, then won another one in 2020. The Jayhawks would have been the favorite to win the national title last season before the coronavirus pandemic canceled the NCAA tournament. ""For almost 20 years, Coach Self has embodied the spirit and tradition of the University of Kansas, leading our men's basketball program to a national championship, 15 Big 12 titles and 17 NCAA Tournament appearances,"" Girod said in the release. ""We believe in Coach Self and we believe in the future of our program under his leadership, and we are thrilled that he will continue to be a Jayhawk for the rest of his coaching career."" Kansas was knocked out in the second round of this year's NCAA tournament by USC after earning a 3-seed. The Jayhawks finished 21-9 overall, 12-6 in the Big 12. ""Bill Self has meant a tremendous amount to the University of Kansas and our entire Lawrence community throughout his 18 seasons,"" interim athletic director Watson said in the statement. ""He has changed the lives of so many young men that have played for him throughout his nearly 30 years as a head coach. I have known Bill for many years, but working closely with him over the past few weeks in my current role has shown me even more so on a daily basis how deeply he cares about this program. We are certainly proud that he began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at KU in 1985 and that this new contract will ensure he finishes his coaching career here as well."" Self had been linked with a potential move to the NBA for the past few years, especially after the FBI investigation into college basketball that included alleged payments from Adidas to a pair of former Kansas players. The NCAA ultimately           Kansas with five Level I violations, including charging the school with a lack of institutional control and Self with head coach responsibility violations. There have been no punishments handed down yet."
"Mets-Nationals series postponed for more testing, contact tracing",sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/mets-nationals-series-postponed-testing-contact-tracing/story?id=76837214,"The season-opening series between the           and           was postponed Friday as the fallout from a COVID-19 outbreak among the Nationals cast into question when Washington's season would begin. At least three Nationals players have tested positive, and the team suspects another player with an inconclusive result is positive as well, leading to the postponement of their scheduled Opening Day game Thursday. Games on Saturday and Sunday were postponed as well and will be made up throughout the rest of the season, as the teams are scheduled to play 19 games against each other as National League East rivals. The Mets will begin their season Monday in          . When Washington plays will depend on the results of contact tracing the team has undertaken in the wake of the outbreak.

Rizzo said one of the players testing positive had a fever, while the others were not displaying COVID-19 symptoms. The jointly negotiated protocol between Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association mandates a weeklong quarantine for someone deemed in close contact with individuals who have tested positive, and those determined to have COVID-19 must isolate for at least 10 days. MLB and the players' association released their weekly testing results Friday, saying three players and one staff member had tested positive for COVID-19 from 14,354 conducted tests. Outbreaks on           and           last season disrupted the teams but ultimately didn't derail them, as both made the postseason.

Silver or White? No way. More drivers are demanding customization,business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/dont-afraid-automakers-encourage-drivers-bold-cars/story?id=76799932,"Dee Quon had a mission. The Southern California resident and longtime MINI Cooper devotee wanted a black John Cooper Works Hardtop 2 Door equipped with every single package available and a piano black interior trim. Red stripes painted on the hood, too. Quon searched and searched for her dream car at local dealerships. The result was always the same: No. ""A lot of dealers build what sells the most,"" she told ABC News. ""I was looking for certain options."" So Quon went online, placed a custom order and waited three months for her JCW MINI to arrive from the British automaker's plant in Oxford, U.K. The plant manager and the quality assurance manager even signed the inside of the hood, making her car a rarity. The agonizing wait was well worth it, she said. ""It's more personalized. Embrace the process -- it's fun,"" she promised. Quon is not alone. Customization has become a thriving business for automakers, with a solid contingent of motorists speccing their vehicles to reflect their personalities -- and wallets. Luxury brands Rolls-Royce and Bentley are still at the forefront of coachbuilding and the business of bespoke, assembling special, one-off conveyances for well-heeled clients. But now mainstream brands like MINI, Volkswagen and Ford are getting into the highly lucrative game. ""Customization is hugely profitable for automakers,"" Ivan Drury, a senior manager at Edmunds, told ABC News. ""Trends come and go so quickly. People want to stand out more. It's a cultural phenomenon."" Drury also pointed out that a specialty trim or distinct feature could increase the vehicle's future resell value. Truck owners in particular are likely to add up to $40,000 in options, selecting every off-roading package and accessory that's available, Drury said. ""The appetite for these options with customers is insatiable,"" he noted. ""Pre-ordering cars is becoming more normalized, especially for people who can play at these price points. People don't want to compromise."" Color, leather, stitching, wood veneers, monograms -- the possibilities (and the imagination) are endless. Here's how some automakers are helping customers stand out on the road and from each other. The uber wealthy turn to the 115-year-old British marque for over-the-top opulence and personalization. Coachbuilding is part of the company's DNA and specialists, carrying briefcases of samples, will fly to clients' yachts, chateaus and penthouse apartments to design a tailor-made vehicle. Will Vetter, product and bespoke manager at Rolls-Royce, said he's worked with customers for more than a year to finalize a concept. ""Configuring a car can be overwhelming. The levels of choices sometimes are daunting,"" Vetter admitted to ABC News. ""We have extensive training for dealers."" About 80% of all Rolls-Royces are specially designed by owners, though some clients, primarily in the U.S., are happy to buy whatever's available on hand. ""The U.S. is an instant gratification market,"" Vetter said. Rolls-Royce recently launched 80-page digital brochures to help clients get familiar with the bespoke process. Options include two-tone exteriors, personalized motifs on the C-pillar, pinstripe wheels, a solid silver or gold plated Spirit of Ecstasy, colored stitching, door embossing, contrasting lambswool floor mats, commissioned umbrellas, the list goes on. The 2021 Ghost, for example, comes with an illuminated fascia made up of 850 stars that took 10,000 hours to craft, a feature that's only found in the newly refreshed sedan. Of course, a Rolls-Royce customer can go an entirely different route and proffer a very distinct vision. Enthusiast and collector Jack Boyd Smith Jr. of Ohio was determined to incorporate Koa wood, a rare species of tree that grows only in Hawaii and is protected in Hawaiian State and National parks, in his new Rolls-Royce Phantom. Smith and his wife were so committed to the design that they waited three years for Rolls-Royce to source a supply and complete the car, now nicknamed the ""Koa Phantom."" The Dove Grey leather interior was also custom matched to Smith's 1934 Packard Twelve Coupe and a bespoke starlight headliner, consisting of 1,420 fiber-optic lights, replicates the constellation of the night sky above Cleveland, Ohio, on Smith’s birth date. Vetter said the company will accommodate nearly all requests. There are some restrictions, though. ""We have to abide by federal vehicle safety standards,"" he said. The iconic Spirit of Ecstasy hood ornament? ""She is off limits."" ""Be brave. There is amazing stuff you can do."" Paul Williams is speaking from experience. A 14-year veteran of Bentley Motors, Williams took over the British automaker's Mulliner division a year ago. He and his growing team of 50 work closely with clients to perfect their Bentleys and deliver one-of-a-kind examples. ""Mulliner is well known,"" he told ABC News. ""We're seeing an increase in demand for personalization, especially in the Middle East. Customers enjoy making the vehicles unique and reflect their personality."" Williams has already received 96 commissions for Flying Spurs, the company's ultra lux sedan that's offered with either a W12 or twin-turbocharged V8 engine. What makes the Flying Spur especially unequaled is the 3D wood paneling inside the cabin, an option that costs $13,400. ""The wood has a diamond quilted feel,"" Williams explained. ""We take a solid piece of wood and machine that into a 3D surface finish. It gives a really beautiful texture. And the wood is treated to last the lifetime of the car."" About 10% of Bentley customers spend the extra effort and money on bespoke creations. And that's fine with Williams, who said Mulliner will always be limited in scope. ""It's a low percentage, but from our perspective, there's so much effort and treatment that makes a car unique,"" he said. ""We can't roll this out broadly."" Williams did acknowledge that bespoke may not appeal to all customers. But it certainly has its advantages. ""It's a challenge when you don't see [the car] in the flesh,"" he said. ""We worked very hard on these visualization tools to give high quality renderings."" He added, ""It's an expression of yourself. Don't be afraid."" Aston Martin’s in-house bespoke division ""Q"" debuted in 2012 and now represents around 10% of annual retail build volumes across Aston's core car range, according to Henry Cozon, head of Q sales. Customers, many of whom are loyal to the brand, are willing to pay more for hand-made quilted leather flooring, specific colors and chrome detailing. Nearly 5% of retail orders for the DBX, Aston's first-ever SUV, come via the Q Commission team, Cozon told ABC News. ""We have recently developed a full carbon fiber boot floor for DBX and also a bespoke jewelry pack that is machined from billet aluminum and only available on DBX,"" he said. It takes on average six months for a Q commissioned car to be complete and owners are invited to visit the factory in Gaydon, U.K., for the car's grand reveal. Q has delivered over 2,000 customer commissions since launching. ""We constantly receive interesting and unusual requests and customers often take inspiration from the most abstract of sources and we work with them to translate this onto their car,"" said Cozon. ""That’s the beauty of Q – it allows customers to fully express their personality and also reflects their lifestyle and achievements."" One of Ford's most anticipated vehicles in more than a decade, the Bronco 4X4 has more than 200 factory-backed accessories for maximum personalization. The off-road modular design platform can be stripped to its base so that doors, fenders and grilles can be added and removed easily. No two Broncos should ever be alike, according to the Dearborn automaker. ""We've seen a tremendous amount of interest in our accessory offerings,"" Esteban Plaza-Jennings, Bronco's product manager, told ABC News. ""We're making Bronco as welcoming to the novice as it is to the enthusiast."" The Bronco configurator site lets interested buyers ""Pick your adventure"" to help tailor the SUV to their needs. Twelve paint colors are available now, with a green arriving in 2022. ""The vehicle is flexible. It's designed around customization,"" Plaza-Jennings said. ""There are so many awesome accessories unique to Bronco."" The accessories and options -- racks, lights, winches, roofs, fender flares -- can quickly push up the vehicle's MSRP. The Sasquatch Package, which includes 35-inch wheels, costs several thousand dollars. ""It's easy to spend over $10K in options,"" Plaza-Jennings acknowledged. And the customization comes straight from the factory, similar to what Rolls-Royce and Bentley provide, he noted. Custom orders are up 30% at MINI, according to Patrick McKenna, head of product planning at MINI USA. Limited inventory has partly led to the surge, McKenna said. But generally about 20% of customers, like Quon, prefer to dream up their own personalized cars. And the options are almost limitless. Exterior color is key but graphics, like the Union Jack, and contrasting colors for the roof and exterior mirror caps are some of the most popular and stylish ways to accessorize a MINI. Door bezels are also customizable, taillights can incorporate the Union Jack flag and braided welt trim and contrast stitching join the long list of interior options. Handcrafted finishes that are found in premium brands are possible as well: Real wood that's sliced thin, stained in dark gray and carefully arranged; aluminum plating embossed with a fine herringbone pattern that is reminiscent of English tweed. ""Every car can be custom built and consumers are using their car as a canvas,"" McKenna said. ""We call it 'you-ification.'"" Still, owners won't end up with a ""Frankenstein car,"" he added. ""We've taken some of those risks out. We don't want it to be too overwhelming for customers."" This year MINI gave owners yet another way to personalize their vehicles: A multitone roof that required MINI to develop a new painting technique. Three color shades are applied in a wet-on-wet painting process, an industry first that will be done on the factory line. ""It takes the brand's hallmark ex works customization options to a new level,"" according to Oliver Heilmer, head of MINI Design. ""And because every roof looks a little bit different and is so unique, it pays to look closely more than ever."" Megan Closset has high hopes Volkswagen's Spektrum Program will return -- and quickly. The product manager for VW's Golf oversaw the program in 2019, which marked the final model year for the 7th generation Golf R. The program was hailed by VW fans who longed for ways to customize their sporty, high performance hot hatch. ""The Spektrum Program was a really special opportunity,"" Closset told ABC News. ""It brought excitement to the cars. Color alone is increasing [in popularity] in the performance segment."" The 199 U.S. customers who were able to snap up one of these Golf Rs were given a choice of 40 custom colors in addition to five standard colors. The custom colors ranged from Nogaro Blue Pearl and Violet Touch Metallic to Viper Green Metallic and Copper Orange Metallic and cost $2,500. The cars were hand sprayed at a small paint shop in Germany and owners had to wait an additional two to four months for delivery. Closset even sent handwritten cards to owners, many of whom have either framed or tucked the card away for safekeeping. ""This was a challenge for VW of America and dealers. We had never done this before,"" she explained. ""We dipped our toes into this new custom paint adventure."" The eighth generation Golf R is expected to arrive in the U.S. by the end of the year. The Spektrum Program, however, may be finished for good. Closset is still rooting for its comeback. ""It's top of mind for me,"" she said. ""We will apply pressure to make it happen."" Land Rover recently unveiled new Range Rover special editions that highlight the brand's Special Vehicle Operations Technical Centre in the U.K. The 2021 Range Rover SVAutobiography Ultimate SUVs ""showcase the full range of personalization touches that can be applied to the timeless Range Rover design,"" according to the company. The SUVs come with illuminated Ultimate edition treadplates, knurled infill and copper-edged metal Range Rover badging on the hood and tailgate, vintage tan leather interior trim and copper weave carbon fiber finishers. Customers can also opt for leather upholstery from the Italian artisans at Poltrona Frau for a ""truly cosseting experience,"" the company said. German automaker BMW will take a customer's favorite color -- matte, metallic, pearlescent -- and apply it to the vehicle as part of the company's Individual program. An online visualizer assists in the process. Exclusive interiors, special equipment, monograms and leather upholstery are available, too. Not every Porsche customer prefers a white, silver or black 911 or Boxster. Even with a choice of 20 ""standard"" colors, there are a handful of owners -- the company says 1% -- who demand even more customization. And they're willing to pay up. Individual paint jobs are always on the table and the sports car maker encourages customers to explore all options as part of its Exclusive Customer Consultation programs."

Stanford Cardinal's Tara VanDerveer named Naismith women's coach of year,sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/stanford-cardinals-tara-vanderveer-named-naismith-womens-coach/story?id=76839354,"SAN ANTONIO -- For the third time in her career,          's Tara VanDerveer was named the Naismith women's college basketball coach of the year. She previous won the award in 1990 and 2011. VanDerveer, 67, is in her 35th season with the Cardinal, who are in their 14th Women's Final Four and face South Carolina in the national semifinals on Friday (ESPN, 6 p.m. ET). The Cardinal, 29-2, won the Pac-12 regular-season title for the 24th time in her career. They also won the championship of the league tournament, which began in 2002, for the 14th time. She was the Pac-12 coach of the year. ""I'm really excited about this team,"" VanDerveer said. ""Every team you kind of have a different relationship with. This particular team is what I want to call a low-maintenance team. We have great leadership. A great upper-class. They understand how we're fortunate to be playing. ""Life has thrown us curveballs. We keep swinging and being flexible and doing whatever it takes. Being out of our county, our gym, our locker room, not having fans. I'm their biggest fan.""

He did play two games with Team USA this February, leading the team in scoring in FIBA qualifying wins over the Bahamas and Mexico while shooting 50% from deep (6-of-12).

Chicago Bears coach Matt Nagy returning to calling plays on offense,sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/chicago-bears-coach-matt-nagy-returning-calling-plays/story?id=76840661,"LAKE FOREST, Ill. --           head coach Matt Nagy has ended any suspense over who will call the team's offensive plays in 2021. The former NFL Coach of the Year confirmed on Friday that he will handle playcalling duties after temporarily ceding the responsibility to offensive coordinator Bill Lazor for a time last season. ""I'm going to be the one calling the plays this year, and so I know that you'll probably be asking that, so we can just let you know that from the front end,"" Nagy said on a Zoom call. Last year, the Bears struggled to find any rhythm on offense until a late-season three-game winning streak lifted Chicago to a wild-card playoff berth. The Bears finished the 2020 season ranked near the bottom in most offensive statistical categories. However, Nagy expressed enthusiasm over Chicago's acquisition of veteran quarterback          , who is the team's new starter after former second overall pick           signed with Buffalo in free agency. Veteran           is penciled in as Chicago's No. 2 quarterback on the depth chart. ""Some things will be a little bit different [on offense],"" Nagy said. ""There's going to be some things that Andy likes that Mitch and Nick hated, and vice versa. But we're going to work together to figure out what that is. So you know, as a personnel department, as Ryan Pace as the GM, myself as the head coach and a coaching staff, when we collectively came together and said, hey, when you go through free agency and you look at everybody that's available, it was really a consensus for us to get Andy in here and move forward as the starting quarterback."""

MLB moving 2021 All-Star Game from Atlanta over Georgia voting law,sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/mlb-moving-2021-star-game-atlanta-georgia-voting/story?id=76842076,"Major League Baseball announced Friday that it is moving the 2021 All-Star Game out of Atlanta in response to a new Georgia law that has civil rights groups concerned about its potential to restrict voting access for people of color. The 2021 MLB draft, a new addition to All-Star Game festivities this year, will also be relocated. In a statement, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said the league is ""finalizing a new host city and details about these events will be announced shortly."" A source told ESPN that the 2022 All-Star Game is still planned for Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles and that that site won't be moved up to fill the void this summer. ""Over the last week, we have engaged in thoughtful conversations with Clubs, former and current players, the Players Association, and The Players Alliance, among others, to listen to their views,"" Manfred said in his statement. ""I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year's All-Star Game and MLB Draft. ""Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box. In 2020, MLB became the first professional sports league to join the non-partisan Civic Alliance to help build a future in which everyone participates in shaping the United States. We proudly used our platform to encourage baseball fans and communities throughout our country to perform their civic duty and actively participate in the voting process. Fair access to voting continues to have our game's unwavering support."" The           said they were ""deeply disappointed"" by the outcome. ""This was neither our decision, nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city,"" the team said in a statement. ""The Braves organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to enhance the discussion. Our city has always been known as a uniter in divided times and we will miss the opportunity to address issues that are important to our community. ""Unfortunately, businesses, employees and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision."" The Players Alliance, consisting of more than 100 current and former players who have united in an effort to empower Black communities, came out in support of MLB's decision with a statement that read in part: ""We want to make our voice heard loud and clear in our opposition of the recent Georgia legislation that not only disproportionately disenfranchises the Black community, but also paves the way for other states to pass similarly harmful laws based largely on widespread falsehoods and disinformation."" The White House said President Joe Biden supports the decision as well. ""The President has made his concerns about the bill passed in Georgia clear, given its extreme provisions that impact the ability of so many citizens to cast their votes,"" the White House said. ""He said earlier this week that if the decision was made by Major League Baseball to move the All-Star game, he would certainly support that decision - and now that MLB has made that choice, he certainly does.'' In a statement, former President Donald Trump blasted the move and urged his supporters to ""boycott baseball and all of the woke companies that are interfering with Free and Fair Elections.'' Former President Barack Obama, meanwhile, lauded the decision as honoring the legend of Braves great Hank Aaron. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed into law last week a sweeping, Republican-sponsored bill that includes new restrictions on voting by mail and greater legislative control over how elections are run. The bill, which also prohibits volunteers from distributing food and water for voters waiting in line, was finalized on March 25 roughly 15 miles from the Braves' stadium, Truist Park. The new voting law, SB202, came in the wake of the first Democratic victories in presidential and Senate elections in Georgia in a generation, which triggered repeated unproven assertions by Trump that the state's election was fraudulent. Supporters of the new law have said it merely ensures election integrity and stamps out potential fraud, while critics have described it as a voter-suppression tactic that would make it more difficult for minorities, particularly people of color, to vote, citing how it reduces ballot access in urban communities that lean Democrat. A recent examination of the 98-page bill by The New York Times identified 16 provisions that either hinder Georgians' right to vote or strip power from state and local elections officials and give it to legislators. The governor said in a statement that MLB ""caved to fear"" by moving the All-Star Game. ""I will not back down. Georgians will not be bullied,"" Kemp said. ""We will continue to stand up for secure, accessible, fair elections. Earlier today, I spoke with the leadership of the Atlanta Braves who informed me they do not support the MLB's decision."" Stacey Abrams, a Democratic former Georgia gubernatorial candidate and voting rights activist,           about her disappointment but understanding over MLB's decision. ""Like many Georgians, I am disappointed that the MLB is relocating the All-Star game; however, I commend the players, owners and League commissioner for speaking out,"" Abrams wrote. ""I urge others in positions of the leadership to do so as well."" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a Democrat, said she supports MLB's decision. Atlanta will no doubt share in the economic loss, though the Braves' home stadium is now located outside the city, in suburban Cobb County. ""Unfortunately, the removal of the MLB All-Star Game from Georgia is likely the first of many dominoes to fall until the unnecessary barriers put in place to restrict access to the ballot box are removed,'' Bottoms said in a statement.  manager Dave Roberts, who is to guide the National League All-Star team, applauded MLB for moving the game from Georgia. ""I think in a world now where people want and need to be heard -- and in this particular case, people of color -- for Major League Baseball to listen and do something about it, to be proactive, it sets a tone,'' said Roberts, the son of a Black father and Japanese mother. MLBPA executive director Tony Clark said last Friday that he ""would look forward"" to discussions around moving the Midsummer Classic -- slated for July 13 -- out of Atlanta. Five days after that, Biden, who won Georgia by less than 12,000 votes, told SportsCenter he would ""strongly support"" such a decision, calling the new bill ""Jim Crow on steroids.""  star          , who has           in the           , was among those expressing support for MLB's decision on Twitter. Despite moving the All-Star Game, Manfred said that ""MLB's planned investments to support local communities in Atlanta as part of our All-Star Legacy Projects will move forward"" and that Aaron, who died in January, would still be celebrated during the All-Star festivities. Atlanta has previously hosted the All-Star Game twice, in 1972 and 2000."

Hardin on Wednesday released statements from 18 women who say that they have worked with the Texans quarterback and that he ""never made them feel uncomfortable or demanded anything outside the scope of a professional massage."" Watson's attorney said the statements were voluntary and from women who have collectively ""worked with Deshaun more than 130 times over the past five years."" The NFL said in a statement Friday that it is ""continuing to monitor all developments"" pertaining to the league's personal conduct policy, and the Texans said in a statement that they would stay in close contact with the NFL during its investigation. NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith said Tuesday that the union would also monitor the situation. ""We monitor these cases, and if it results in an investigation by the league with respect to the personal conduct policy, we'll become involved in that,"" Smith said during an interview with ESPN's Keyshawn, JWill & Zubin show.

""I immediately got scared as s--- because I hate flying in general and it didn't sound good,"" Mitchell said. Conley estimated that 10 to 15 minutes passed before the pilots communicated with the passengers.

So that's why it hurt so much, because it's something that she practices all the time,"" Staley said. ""She's not that type of player that's going to allow that shot to impact her next shot, her next move in the journey that she has in basketball. But when she's back in her room, she's going to cry.

Instead, as she tried to dribble out of a double-team, the ball got away from her, Boston grabbed it and fed it to Beal, who went in for the layup. Beal's shot missed but bounced right into the hands of Boston, who missed the putback at the buzzer. ""It was in our hands,"" said Zia Cooke, who led South Carolina with 25 points, ""but we just came up short."" This is Stanford's 14th Final Four, and the Cardinal have one of their best defenses in coach Tara VanDerveer's 35 seasons at Stanford. It caused problems for the Gamecocks all night, as they finished 11-of-37 in the paint. The last two misses were the most dramatic. ""I mean, you got to hold on to the ball at the end of the game. Cam was really upset with herself that it got away from her,"" VanDerveer said. ""But they did have two good looks. This is one of those survive and advance. It was not a pretty game for us, but that's credit to South Carolina, how aggressive they are, how athletic they are. We're going to have to learn from it and play better."" Boston, Beal and Cooke are all sophomores playing in their first NCAA tournament, having missed last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Staley knows she has a lot of talent coming back, but also how much a tough ending can stick with players. Asked about how she would help Boston get over the last miss, Staley reflected back on the last game of her college career, and the shot she heaved up just before the buzzer against VanDerveer and Stanford in the 1992 national semifinals. She still thinks about that miss, second-guessing herself for not taking advantage of her defender and trying to draw a foul. The final score of that loss to Stanford was the same as Friday's: 66-65 ""So that stays with me. That's 29 years later,"" said Staley, who finally got her national championship with the Gamecocks in 2017. ""But from 29 years ago to now, I mean, there are so many great memories that replace that. It only comes up when I'm asked. ""Aliyah will get over it. Aliyah is a great player. Aliyah will come back stronger, better. If she's ever put in this position again, she'll knock it down."""
Dallas Mavericks' Rick Carlisle cleared to travel after 'unexpected' positive on COVID-19 test,sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/dallas-mavericks-rick-carlisle-cleared-travel-unexpected-positive/story?id=76846157," coach Rick Carlisle has been cleared to travel with the team to Washington after missing Friday's 99-86 win over the           at Madison Square Garden due to a positive test for COVID-19. Carlisle, 61, called the test result ""unexpected,"" saying that he was fully vaccinated in January. ""There's a chance and a hope that it will be a false positive,"" Carlisle said during his pregame videoconference, which he conducted from his New York City hotel room. ""This seems like possibly a mistake, but for these reasons I'm entering the [NBA health and safety] protocol."" Assistant coach Jamahl Mosley replaced Carlisle in Friday's win. Mosley said after the game that Carlisle had been cleared to travel with the team to Washington, where the Mavs will play the Wizards on Saturday night. Carlisle said he is experiencing no symptoms. ""I feel great,"" Carlisle said. ""I worked out earlier this morning. But this is just one of those situations where we've all got to be light on our feet."" Mosley, the team's defensive coordinator, served as the acting head coach for a full game for the first time in his career. He interviewed with the Knicks,           and           when those teams conducted head-coaching searches over the past two years, and Carlisle said that Mosely filling his role for the game was ""a great opportunity for him to show what he's capable of."" ""Rick has done such a phenomenal job of preparing all of his staff members to take over or just to step up in every moment,"" Mosley said. ""It's the same thing with the team -- just being prepared in every moment. For me, it was just going off of the guidance that he's given me. He text and said, 'You're ready for this. You're prepared for this, and just go off of the things we've constantly talked about.'"""
Golden State Warriors suffer 'humiliating' 53-point loss to Toronto Raptors,sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/golden-state-warriors-suffer-humiliating-53-point-loss/story?id=76847885,"The           suffered one of the most ""humiliating"" losses in franchise history Friday night during a 53-point defeat at the hands of the           -- a team that came into the game having lost 13 of its past 14 games. ""You saw it,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said after the          . ""We just got destroyed. Not a whole lot to be said. Humiliating for everybody involved."" The Warriors, who trailed by as many as 61 points in the second half, set some dubious marks in a game in which both           (tailbone soreness) and           (left finger sprain) sat out. The Raptors outscored the Warriors by 51 points in the second and third quarters, the largest point differential over a two-quarter span within a game in NBA history, according to Elias Sports Bureau research. The Warriors became the fourth team in the past 25 seasons to trail by at least 60 points in a game, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. The Raptors' 53-point margin of victory is also tied for the third largest in league history by a team that is 10 or more games below .500. ""I just think the game went south on us quickly and we got demoralized,"" Kerr said. ""I think without Steph and Draymond out there I think we were a little bit rudderless when things went south. We didn't have the internal fight that we needed to kind of get over the hump."" That was evident in a variety of different areas, but offensively, the stat that might be most jarring for the Warriors is the fact that they became the only team in the past 25 years to lose a game by at least 50 points and not score a fast-break point. They had only one fast-break attempt the whole game and missed it. It's a huge reason Kerr was so frustrated with his team's lack of ball movement. ""Our team has been built on sharing the ball,"" Kerr said. ""When you move the ball in this game, that's when the magic happens, when you build an energy, a karma, the shots tend to go in if you move the ball and you share it. And I just saw one possession after another tonight that was one pass and a shot. We've got to play for each other, and I didn't think we did that tonight."" The Warriors, now 23-26, sit in 10th place in the Western Conference and have struggled all season to find consistency. Last week, veteran           acknowledged that Curry and Green shared messages for their teammates about looking within and trying to play better. After Friday's embarrassing performance, veteran           said injured former All-Star           shared some thoughts with several teammates after the game. ""It's a hard pill for them to swallow,"" Bazemore said of the Warriors' missing three core players. ""We're talking about -- and Klay is back there as well, these guys [have] five straight Finals appearances. This is by any means not acceptable by them at all. This hurts them more than anything. Klay was fired up after the game. And this has been the toughest two years watching his guys out there, and him not being able to help. So I think it's lit a fire up under him, and Steph and Draymond, they know how important they are to us."" For Thompson, the loss was even tougher to watch given that he is currently rehabbing an Achilles injury that has forced him to miss his second straight season. Bazemore said Thompson's message to a few teammates was simple in its point. ""He was just kind of going off about how he missed the game and how it's just not acceptable to lose this way,"" Bazemore said. ""He's fired up, man. It's hard watching, regardless if you're playing or not playing."" The good news for the Warriors is that Curry is expected to be back Sunday against the          . Green's status remains unclear given that he was initially expected to play on Friday, but after trying to warm up he told the coaching staff that he couldn't catch the ball with his left hand because of the finger injury. Green told Kerr he could play, but the veteran coach made the decision for Green to sit. As the Warriors wait for their stars to heal, they've got a looming issue with the young center they were hoping would help them this season. Big man           , 20, had another rough night against the Raptors, struggling on both ends of the floor, which has been an ongoing theme since the All-Star break. Kerr said the Warriors want to simplify parts of the game plan for Wiseman so that he can build his confidence back up. ""As a young player, a lot of guys try to do too much,"" Kerr said. ""I think that's what's happening with James right now. I think he's such a gifted guy, and he's always been able to do whatever he wanted on the floor, but the NBA, the game happens so fast that you just have to sort of strip it down to 'let's be good at the things that I can be good at right now and then my game will expand as we go forward.' And that's what we're trying to share with James and teach him. ""But the only way to learn that is to feel it, and he's feeling it. So he will grow from here and we'll stay positive with him, we'll try to peel things back and keep things really simple and help him build his confidence over the last quarter of the season."" As the Warriors hope to see more development down the stretch from the No. 2 overall pick in the 2020 draft, they do so with a group that hit the low point of its season Friday night. Kerr is hopeful his team will bounce back after two straight defeats, but he also understands that each individual player has to find his own motivation to get things back on track before it's too late. ""As a coach, you try to navigate the season with your team as best you can,"" Kerr said. ""So there's times for humor, there's times for joy, there's times for serious discussion and soul-searching. This is a time for soul-searching for sure."""
Cris Cyborg to defend Bellator title against Leslie Smith on May 21,sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/cris-cyborg-defend-bellator-title-leslie-smith-21/story?id=76846158," will put her Bellator women's featherweight title on the line against           on May 21, the promotion announced Friday night during the Bellator 255 broadcast. Cyborg beat Smith in 2016 in what was Cyborg's UFC debut. Cyborg (23-2, 1 NC) is one of the best female fighters of all time. The Brazilian slugger is coming off a second-round submission win over           last October. That was Cyborg's first title defense. Cyborg, 35, stopped           by fourth-round TKO in January 2020 to win the title. That victory made Cyborg the first fighter to win titles in four major promotions: UFC, Bellator, Strikeforce and Invicta. Since 2005, Cyborg has been defeated only by UFC double champion          . Cyborg left the UFC when her contract expired in 2019 after a rocky tenure. Smith (12-8-1) has won four of her past five fights. The California native is coming off a unanimous decision over           last September. Smith, 38, was finished by Cyborg in 1:21 at UFC 198 on May 14, 2016, but disputed that, saying it was an early stoppage. She is best known for her attempts to organize MMA fighters, who don't have a union or association."
Arizona Wildcats stun UConn Huskies to make first women's NCAA tournament championship game,sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/arizona-wildcats-stun-uconn-huskies-make-womens-ncaa/story?id=76848241,"SAN ANTONIO -- UConn went into the Final Four on Friday night as the heavy favorites, with the player of the year and a championship pedigree. Arizona came in with an underdog coach and an underdog story, playing as if it had nothing to lose. For 40 minutes, the Wildcats played stifling defense and took freshman phenom Paige Bueckers off her game, pulling off the 69-59 stunner to advance to the program's first national championship game appearance. The Wildcats will face Pac-12 rival Stanford in the national championship game Sunday. It's the first time the Pac-12 has had two teams face off in the championship game. It was Arizona that looked like the team that had been there before, while UConn looked as if it simply could not handle the pressure or the spotlight. But in reality, it was the Wildcats' first win against an AP No. 1 team -- in their first-ever Final Four appearance, no less. Afterward, UConn guard Christyn Williams said, ""I think we came out with the wrong mentality. I thought we thought it was going to be easy, I guess, and we got flustered. They had great ball pressure. It wasn't like anything that we've seen before this season. We just couldn't get in the flow offensively."" Arizona coach Adia Barnes and her team are probably not surprised to hear that, thriving off the doubters and the non-believers throughout the NCAA tournament. Guard Aari McDonald, who took center stage once again with a game-high 26 points, said the Wildcats use it all as motivation -- especially getting left out of the NCAA's own promotional video for the women's Final Four. If one scene from the game embodied that feeling, it was Barnes being shown in a huddle late in the game, using a choice curse word to remind her players. ""The cuss word is basically, 'forget everybody,'"" Barnes said after the game. ""... 'Forget everybody if they don't believe in us, because we believe in us.'"" ""We shocked the world tonight,"" McDonald said. ""Keep betting against my teammates and I, we're going to show you wrong. We're going to prove you wrong."" Barnes, who played at Arizona, has turned around a Wildcats program that doesn't have the same history or tradition as UConn under coach Geno Auriemma, in his 21st Final Four. But they took it to the Huskies from the start, and they did that behind McDonald, who was clutch not only with her scoring, but with her poise, confidence and leadership on the court. It seemed clear from the outset that Arizona wanted to deliver a message. ""I've been an underdog all my life,"" Barnes said. ""Too small to do this, too this to do that, too inexperienced to do this. We prove it wrong every time. I don't care. It just motivates me and my team."" UConn simply never responded, and the Huskies have now lost in four straight Final Four semifinals. Bueckers finished with a quiet 18 points on 5-of-13 shooting in the final game of her freshman year. But even as she struggled, nobody around her stepped up and the Arizona defense made even the easy shots seem impossible. In the first half alone, Arizona contested 15 of UConn's 25 field goal attempts, and held the Huskies to 3-of-15 shooting on those attempts. For the game, UConn was just 6-of-31 on contested shots, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. Williams and Olivia Nelson-Ododa combined to shoot 1-of-11 on layups -- including 0-of-5 from Nelson-Ododa. ""I've said all along this year we have a very immature group, not just young,"" Auriemma said. ""When we're high and when we're on top of the world, we think everything's great. When things don't go our way, there's a poutiness about us, there's a feeling sorry for ourselves about us that you don't win championships when you're like that unless you get lucky. ""I've been down this road before. I do think that these games do tend to stay with you a little bit longer. I would say, at least on my end, I'm going to be coaching in the Final Four next year on April 2nd, whatever that date is."" He will have Bueckers back to help him get there. Going into the game, all eyes were on her after her outstanding performance not just during the season but in the NCAA tournament -- during which she scored 90 total points before Friday. Even after UConn went down by double-digits, the Huskies have been a team that can get hot at any moment. But the shots remained elusive, and Arizona continued with its relentless pressure, playing with the confidence of a team that suggested not for a minute this was its first time playing in the Final Four. Through three quarters, UConn had 39 points -- its fewest since quarters were implemented in 2015-16 season. Still, the Huskies made a push late in the fourth quarter, narrowing the gap to 60-55 with 1:23 left, bringing the fans inside the Alamodome to their feet. Would this be the run everybody expected to see from the usually fast-charging Huskies? No, it would not. Now UConn, having lost in four straight Final Four semifinals, will have to wait another year to try to win its first national championship since 2016. While Arizona moves on, in an attempt to make history of its own. ""It hasn't settled in yet,"" Barnes said. ""It's amazing. This was a really hard game. We did not have any pressure. It's a much easier situation to be us than it is UConn because I think the program is so good, you're expected to win, and that's hard. ""For us, it's a lot easier to play loose when there isn't pressure. We got hot at the right time during the tournament. Everybody has done a little bit more. That's all I can ask for. They're playing their hearts out. They believe, I believe. We don't care if anybody believes."""

The game featured two of the league's best scorers:           was averaging 29.8 points, second in the NBA, while Antetokounmpo entered fifth with 28.3. But Antetokounmpo had the hot hand Friday, making all 18 of his shots inside the 3-point arc. He ties Wilt Chamberlain for the most 2-point field goals made without a miss, according to ESPN's Stats and Information. An early 11-0 run helped the Bucks jump to a 19-7 lead. Milwaukee led by 14 points during the opening half, but the Blazers closed the gap to 60-53 before heading into the break. Lillard's 3-pointer got Portland within 60-58 early in the fourth quarter, but the Bucks wouldn't let the Blazers get any closer. Holiday's basket extended Milwaukee's lead to 86-70, and the Bucks capped the quarter with an 11-1 run. The Bucks dominated in the paint all night, and no one more so than the two-time MVP. Antetokounmpo outscored the Trail Blazers 47-46 from two-point range and the free-throw line, the first player ever to accomplish that feat, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The Blazers bench struggled, going 0 for 16 from the field through the first three quarters.           hit a 3-pointer early in the fourth to end the drought. Milwaukee was coming off a 112-97 victory at the Lakers on Wednesday, which snapped a three-game losing streak."
Los Angeles Lakers' Marc Gasol frustrated with role since Andre Drummond's arrival,sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/los-angeles-lakers-marc-gasol-frustrated-role-andre/story?id=76850502," center            admitted Friday night that he has been questioning his place on the team since           was added from the buyout market last weekend. Drummond was named the starter almost immediately after he arrived, and Gasol was relegated to the bench on a team that already has          , one of the leading Sixth Man of the Year contenders, playing backup center. Gasol, speaking after the Lakers'           over the            on Friday, said he was unsure how often his number will be called with Drummond in the fold. ""I think there's an 'if' -- 'if' they need you. And it's a big 'if,'"" Gasol said when asked about Lakers coach Frank Vogel repeatedly stating Gasol's continued importance. ""You're not Plan A right now. You're Plan C, D. ... You have to accept it because that's your job. And that's what you sign up to do. It's never easy to accept that."" With Drummond out of the lineup against the Kings, recovering from a torn nail on his right big toe, Gasol, 36, was thrust back into the starting lineup and contributed 5 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists and 1 steal. His assist total was second highest on the team, behind only point guard          's eight, and L.A. outscored Sacramento by 20 points in the 28 minutes Gasol was on the floor. ""I think people need to understand how good of a player Marc Gasol is and how valuable he is to what we're doing,"" Vogel said afterward. ""And we're going to play our most important players, so he's going to help us win a championship this year. That's the plan. That's the vision. Obviously Andre coming along gives us the depth. But we're going to need all three of those guys. We stated that from Day 1, and Marc is one of our most important players. He dominated the game tonight with five points, OK? And this is what Marc brings to the table."" Gasol had previously declined speaking to reporters three times since L.A. signed Drummond and was clearly still harboring some frustration Friday about the franchise's decision when breaking his silence on the move. ""Things can change quickly in the NBA, just as they have changed for me,"" Gasol said when asked whether he wanted to stay with the Lakers or seek a buyout of his own. ""But, I'm committed to this team. It's a hard pill to swallow because I know I'm going to be out of the lineup at some point. It's never easy on a player. As a basketball player, you want to play. You want to contribute, especially when you made that commitment for that reason. But, we'll see."" Gasol signed a two-year contract with the defending champion Lakers in the offseason to follow in the footsteps of his older brother, Pau Gasol, and help L.A. hoist another Larry O'Brien Trophy. His intention was to not just be part of a championship team but to play and have his skill set elevate the entire group in its pursuit of the ultimate prize. He came into Friday averaging career lows in points (4.8), rebounds (3.9), field goal percentage (40.3%) and minutes (19.5) and recently dealt with contracting COVID-19, which caused him to miss nine straight games. As Vogel alluded to, Gasol's value to the Lakers was more about the team's overall performance than his individual numbers, with the team ranking No. 1 in the league in defensive efficiency for the majority of the season with the former Defensive Player of the Year manning the middle. ""You ask if you've done something wrong when you try to do everything for the team,"" he said. ""It's pretty obvious I don't care much about my stats and the shots that I get or rebounds that I get. I try to box my guy out and make the next play, help everyone out. It's not easy, but it's life. You have to adapt. Like I said, either you take it as a challenge or you move on."" Vogel maintained that Gasol will continue to have a role in L.A. and detailed how he and the organization will rally around him while Gasol adjusts to the lineup shuffle. ""The approach is full support,"" Vogel said. ""It's difficult to see that your role is going to change: How can we support you? And make sure that they understand that they are a vital piece, like Marc is a vital piece to us winning the championship this year. And there's no other way to look at it other than that."""

Loyola Chicago's Porter Moser hired as Oklahoma men's basketball coach,sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/loyola-chicagos-porter-moser-hired-oklahoma-mens-basketball/story?id=76853219,"'s Porter Moser has been hired as            men's basketball coach, OU athletic director Joe Castiglione announced Saturday. Moser has been one of the hottest mid-major coaches in the country since leading Loyola Chicago to the Final Four in 2018. Since then, he has led the Ramblers to at least a share of two Missouri Valley Conference regular-season championships. They went 26-5 this season, beating           and 1-seed           en route to a Sweet 16 appearance. ""I've always said there are reasons why you win. If you look at the standards that the programs at Oklahoma have set, there are reasons why they've won,"" Moser said in a statement. ""The coaches, infrastructure and community are all championship caliber. You just want to be a part of that. To play in a premiere league like the Big 12 and be a part of this championship culture excites me."" A Naperville, Illinois, native, Moser hasn't jumped at high-major coaching opportunities over the past couple of seasons.           pursued him after Chris Mullin stepped down, but Moser returned to Loyola. He was linked to various openings this spring but appeared likely to head back to the Ramblers until Oklahoma coach Lon Kruger retired late last month. Castiglione quickly zeroed in on Moser, and he had been the clear leader for the job the past couple of days. ""We are absolutely thrilled to announce and welcome Porter Moser as our next great OU head coach,"" Castiglione said in a statement. ""As we dug deep into the backgrounds of candidates, his attributes, acumen and record of success totally aligned with what we were seeking."" Oklahoma will introduce Moser at a news conference next week. Moser began his coaching career in 1990 as an assistant coach at          , his alma mater. He also spent time as an assistant coach at          ,          ,           and          . Moser was also a head coach at Arkansas-Little Rock and          . ""It is impossible to properly thank Porter for all he's done for our basketball program and University,"" Loyola Chicago athletic director Steve Watson said in a statement. ""His vision and leadership brought Loyola to new heights and Ramblers everywhere will be eternally grateful. A huge thank you and best wishes, from all Ramblers, are rightfully being extended to Porter and his family as they embark on their next journey."" Kruger retired after 45 years in coaching.

Tom Brady rookie card sells for record $2.25 million,sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/tom-brady-rookie-card-sells-record-225-million/story?id=76852996,"While           is breaking records on the field, he continues to break records off the field as well. Brady's rookie card sold in March for $1.32 million, believed to be a record high for any football card, and now the same type of card has blown past that record, selling for $2.25 million on Friday. The 2000 Playoff Contenders Championship Rookie Ticket card is autographed and numbered 99 out of 100, meaning only 100 copies of this particular card were produced. The version that sold in March to Fitbit CEO James Park was graded as an 8 with the autograph graded a 10. The card that sold Friday was graded as an 8.5 with a 9 on the autograph, but the buyer for this particular card wishes to stay anonymous. ""I wasn't shocked (by the price), but I was certainly surprised,"" Lelands president Mike Heffner said. ""I know the market is headed upward, especially with rare and desirable cards such as that one, but I didn't really anticipate it. I had an inkling just feeling the performance of the other cards over the past month, it was certainly a possibility but these modern cards are definitely for real."" Brady's rookie card broke the record back in March, beating out a           card that sold for $861,000 in the beginning of February. The 2017 National Treasures autographed Mahomes card was graded a 9 and was one of only five of that specific card. That sale broke the previous record, which was held by another Brady card that sold for $555,988 in January. The meteoric rise in prices only a few months apart is a perfect example of the boom the sports card industry has experienced over the past year. For the sake of comparison, a higher graded version of this Brady rookie card, a Mint 9 with a 10 grading on the autograph, sold for $400,100 just two years ago. Now the same card has eclipsed $2 million as prices for rare and expensive sports cards and memorabilia continue to climb."
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer questioned if Cardinal could continue after nine weeks on road,sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/stanford-coach-tara-vanderveer-questioned-cardinal-continue-weeks/story?id=76854923,"SAN ANTONIO --           coach Tara VanDerveer has her team playing for a national championship on Sunday against Arizona. But she admitted for the first time Saturday she wondered how the Cardinal would even get to this point after enhanced COVID-19 guidelines in Santa Clara County forced them on the road for nine weeks. The odyssey started in early December and lasted through early February, taking them through six states and a temporary ""home"" in Santa Cruz before they were given clearance to return home to Stanford to play out the regular season. ""There was a point where -- I don't even know that I should admit this -- but I was like, I don't know that we can keep doing this, in terms of going to Santa Cruz,"" VanDerveer said on a Zoom call with reporters. ""Testing like we were testing. There were some days where I just said, 'Whoa, this, might be too much. We might have to just take a pause, ourselves. ""But we have great leadership. We have, competitive motivated, talented, really strong women on our team, and they have dug deep. I think that off the court experience has made us tougher, stronger and more determined. We're not going to let COVID get us down, whether it's testing or Zooming. We're going to be the best Stanford basketball team we can be, and I'm proud of our team for that."" There was nothing perfect about the scenario. Stanford forward Cameron Brink detailed a few times where the power went out at a gym they managed to practice in. ""We were practicing in the dark,"" she said. ""It was freezing in that gym, but we're thankful we had a gym to practice. It made us tougher. We had some really hard practices in that gym, and I feel like those practices are a big reason why we're here today."" She also attributes the bubble Stanford created for itself during its extended road trip has helped the Cardinal manage the bubble they have been in during the NCAA tournament in San Antonio. ""I feel like it's kind of an advantage for us,"" Brink said. ""When we were on the road for almost two months straight, other teams were kind of at home and when they came to the bubble in San Antonio, they didn't really know what to expect, and we kind of knew like what being stuck in hotels like for weeks on end, so I think we're lucky to have experienced that."" Beyond the bubble experience, there also is familiarity with the opponent Sunday:          , a team the Cardinal beat twice this season. This is the first all-Pac-12 championship basketball game matchup in history -- both men's and women's. Stanford is trying to win its first title in 29 years, while Arizona is playing for the first national championship in school history. No matter who wins, it would be the first Pac-12 women's basketball championship since Stanford last won it in 1992. ""This is honestly a dream come true for us in the Pac-12 because for so long, the conference has not gotten the respect that I feel it deserves,"" VanDerveer said. Arizona coach Adia Barnes agreed. ""For me to constantly see the Pac-12 have no respect, it's continuously and it's always happening,"" Barnes said. ""So now I'm hoping that with both of us in the championship game, that the Pac-12 will get more respect, and the East Coast bias will stop. It's not going to stop overnight, but I think that you need to respect the Pac-12 a lot more."""
MLB moves All-Star Game out of Atlanta over voting law controversy,sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/mlb-moves-star-game-atlanta-voting-law-controversy/story?id=76840225,"Major League Baseball has moved this year's All-Star Game out of Atlanta following controversy generated by Georgia's  . ""Over the last week, we have engaged in thoughtful conversations with Clubs, former and current players, the Players Association, and The Players Alliance, among others, to listen to their views,"" Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. ""I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year's All-Star Game and MLB Draft."" Manfred said the new host city and details about events will be announced ""shortly."" At a press conference on Saturday, Gov. Brian Kemp slammed MLB's decision, saying, ""I will not be backing down from this fight."" ""MLB caved to fear and lies from liberal activists,"" Kemp said. ""They ignored the facts of our new election integrity law and they ignored the consequences of their decision on our community."" Kemp blamed Democrats, including President Joe Biden and former Georgia Rep. Stacey Abrams, for MLB's decision. ""Major League Baseball, Coca-Cola and Delta may be scared of Stacey Abrams, Joe Biden and the left, but I am not and we are not,"" said Kemp, echoing his sentiments made in a statement issued Friday that MLB's ""knee-jerk reaction"" was because ""cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life, sports included."" The Atlanta Braves said in a statement that the team was ""deeply disappointed"" by the decision and that ""this was neither our decision, nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city. The Braves organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to have the discussion."" The new law, passed by the Georgia House and Senate and signed by Kemp on March 25, has   due to several limits it puts on voting in the state. The bill passed along party lines, with Republicans vocally supporting it and Democrats calling it voter suppression. Republicans contend it will streamline elections and increase confidence in the process following outrage from Republicans and former President Donald Trump over his defeat in the presidential election and Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock winning runoff elections in January. Critics see it differently, contending it's meant to suppress the votes of historically disenfranchised communities, namely Black voters. The chief executives of Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola   on Wednesday, a change from prior public stances. After the bill passed, Delta's CEO praised aspects of it while a Coca-Cola executive said the corporation was ""disappointed in the outcome."" Neither corporation publicly opposed the bill before it was signed into law despite mounting pressure from a coalition of voting rights and civil liberties groups. Biden has condemned the new law in and voiced support for moving the All-Star Game out of Atlanta in  . ""I think today's professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly,"" Biden said. ""I would strongly support them doing that. People look to them. They're leaders."" Ossoff has said he disagreed with Biden over moving the game, and  Warnock issued a statement calling MLB's decision an ""unfortunate consequence"" resulting from ""politicians seeking to retain power at the expense of Georgians' voices."" ""It is my hope,"" Warnock added, ""that businesses, athletes and entertainers can protest this law not by leaving Georgia but by coming here and fighting voter suppression head on, and hand-in-hand with the community."" Abrams, who's led the charge for increased access to voting in Georgia,   on Wednesday asking for companies not to boycott the state. ""I understand the passion of those calling for boycotts of Georgia following the passage of SB 202,"" she said in the video. ""Boycotts have been an important tool throughout our history to achieve social change. But here's the thing: Black, Latino, AAPI and Native American voters whose votes are the most suppressed under SB 202 are also the most likely to be hurt by potential boycotts of Georgia. To our friends across the country, please do not boycott us."" Former President Barack Obama on Friday tweeted his congratulations to MLB for ""taking a stand."" Kemp and Georgia House Speaker David Ralston criticized Abrams for MLB moving the game even though she doesn't support the boycott. ""Republicans who passed and defended Senate Bill 202 did so knowing the economic risks to our state. They prioritized making it harder for people of color to vote over the economic well-being of all Georgians,"" Abrams said in a statement following the announcement of the All-Star Game leaving Atlanta. ""Like many Georgians, I am disappointed that the MLB is relocating the All-Star game; however, I commend the players, owners and League commissioner for speaking out."" MLB reiterated its support for voting access in its statement and called attention to the voter initiatives it undertook last season. ""Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box,"" Manfred's statement continued. ""In 2020, MLB became the first professional sports league to join the non-partisan Civic Alliance to help build a future in which everyone participates in shaping the United States."" ""We proudly used our platform to encourage baseball fans and communities throughout our country to perform their civic duty and actively participate in the voting process,"" Manfred continued. ""Fair access to voting continues to have our game's unwavering support."" Freddie Freeman, the Braves' top player and the National League MVP in 2020, said Thursday before the team's season opener that he'd prefer the league kept the game in Atlanta and used it as a way to call attention to the law and the importance of access to voting. ""I think it'd be better to keep it and use a platform,"" Freeman told reporters. ""What's happened in the last couple of months has already gone through, so why not use what we already have here as a platform in the city and state that it has been passed through?"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a Democrat who called the elections bill both ""ridiculous"" and ""unnecessary,"" predicted more fallout. ""Just as elections have consequences, so do the actions of those who are elected. Unfortunately, the removal of the @MLB All Star game from GA is likely the 1st of many dominoes to fall, until the unnecessary barriers put in place to restrict access to the ballot box are removed,"" she  . On the same day MLB pulled this year's All-Star Game out of Atlanta, Milwaukee made a pitch to host the game, with Mayor Tom Barrett writing a letter to Manfred that read, in part: ""As you review alternative sites for the game, I ask you to consider Milwaukee. It is a particularly appropriate location to honor Hank Aaron who is a revered and beloved former Milwaukeean. He started and concluded his Major League career with teams here."" The All-Star Game was last held in Milwaukee in 2002 at what was then known as Miller Park. ""We are finalizing a new host city,"" Manfred said in his statement, ""and details about these events will be announced shortly."""

The moment, caught on ESPN cameras, went viral immediately after the win Friday night clinched the Wildcats a spot in the national championship game for the first time in school history. In her post-game press conference, Barnes admitted ""I did say a cuss word. The cuss word is basically, 'forget everybody ...

So I'm in those moments, and that's how I am, so I don't apologize for doing that. I'm just me and I have to just be me."" Barnes and her players have said they felt disrespected at multiple times throughout the tournament, culminating with the NCAA leaving them out of a promotional video previewing the Women's Final Four earlier this week.

Brooklyn Nets' Steve Nash says there's 'a high probability' Kevin Durant (hamstring) returns this week,sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/brooklyn-nets-steve-nash-high-probability-kevin-durant/story?id=76855172,"NEW YORK -- There is a ""high probability"" that           will return to the court this coming week after missing more than seven weeks with a hamstring strain,            coach Steve Nash said Saturday. Nash said there is a chance Durant could play as soon as Monday against the          . ""I am not certain on Monday,"" Nash said. ""I think it's an outside possibility, but I also couldn't say he's in any stretch probable for Monday. I think it's just wait and see. But it does look positive that this week sometime, there's a high probability he can return."" Durant last played on Feb. 13 against the          .

The Nets' Big Three of Durant,           and           have played just seven games together since Harden was traded to Brooklyn in mid-January. On Thursday, Durant said that he is feeling ""great"" in his rehabilitation and that he is ""progressing pretty well"" toward returning to the court. ""Initially, I didn't think it was that bad, just a regular strain,"" Durant said. ""Then we got a second scan and they say it was a little deeper than that. It was one of those things where I'm not feeling a ton of pain, but you don't want to force one of these injuries and make it worse."" Durant went on to say that he felt he had to be ""smart"" and ""cautious"" with his hamstring. Before Durant was sidelined, he was averaging 29.0 points, 7.3 rebound and 5.3 assists. When the former league MVP returns, the Nets will be tasked with quickly building chemistry on the fly before the playoffs begin in mid-May. Nash feels the friendships the group has built off the court should aid the players in meshing well on the floor. Still, Nash said the entire roster needs to play some games together so the Nets can iron out a rotation and jell before the postseason begins. Nash said he also felt the team needed to play through challenging games, some close games, together and ""face some adversity,"" so that they have some familiarity before they find themselves facing that in a playoff game. ""I think a lot of first-year teams struggle to compete for a championship if for no other reason than that collective history and experience,"" Nash said. ""So, that's something we have to accept and have to overcome."""

"Jamel Herring dominates Carl Frampton, who announces his retirement",sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/jamel-herring-dominates-carl-frampton-announces-retirement/story?id=76858984,"Jamel Herring sent Carl Frampton into retirement with a sixth-round TKO in a third defense of his WBO world junior lightweight title Saturday. Herring fought to a career-best win as he thwarted Frampton's attempt to become the first boxer from Ireland to win world titles in three weight divisions. Afterward, an emotional Frampton announced his retirement. Herring, 35, shrugged off a nasty cut on his right eyelid to produce a polished performance as he controlled the distance against his shorter opponent, who was stopped after hitting the canvas in the fifth and sixth rounds. Herring (23-2, 11 KOs) celebrated his achievement without the presence of fans because of coronavirus restrictions at Caesars Palace Dubai in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. A 2012 Olympian originally from Long Island, New York, but now based in Cincinnati, Herring deserved to hear cheers for his achievement, the latest chapter of a late-blossoming career. Afterward, he said he hoped to unify belts against Mexico's Oscar Valdez, the WBC champion and ESPN's No. 1-ranked fighter in the division. ""I want to get another title,"" Herring said. ""I know Oscar Valdez has expressed interest in unifying. Most people know I have plans in moving up [in weight], but if that fight is available, let's do it."" But while Herring looks forward to bigger fights, Frampton (28-3, 16 KOs) is hanging up the gloves after a third professional defeat in a division with opponents who are too big for him. Frampton, 34, finishes after winning world titles at junior featherweight and featherweight, which is enough for some to consider him the best boxer in Irish history, regardless of whether he became a three-weight world champion against Herring. ""I'm deeply upset,"" said Frampton, who said he wanted to dedicate the fight to his old amateur coach, Billy McKee, who died recently. ""I said before the fight I would retire if I lost this fight and that's exactly what I will do. ... I want to dedicate my life to my family now. Boxing has been good to me. It has also been bad to me. The last few years have been the best of my career."" If there were any doubts around Frampton's quest to make history, they were based on Herring's physical advantages. They turned out to be valid concerns as Frampton failed to impose himself against the biggest opponent of his career. Herring is 5 inches taller than Frampton and has a 7-inch reach advantage. ""I lost to the better man,"" Frampton said. ""I really struggled to get inside him. ... It's zero excuses. I had an amazing camp."" Frampton questioned how well Herring made weight for their fight, but the American looked a lot sharper than he did in his previous outing against Jonathan Oquendo in September, when Herring won after Oquendo was disqualified because of an illegal head-butt. ""It was an emotional roller coaster just to get here,"" Herring said. ""My last outing wasn't the best. People called me every name in the book, people doubted me but even with the cut I wasn't going to quit."" In the opening round Saturday, Herring contained Frampton behind his long jab and also landed a good left. In the second round, Herring continued to dictate the fight as Frampton struggled to get inside the American's jab. Frampton was knocked back on his heels by a straight left early in the third as Herring controlled the early rounds by controlling the distance. Frampton was better when the fight was fought at close range, as it was in the fourth, and he unloaded hooks with Herring against the ropes. The attack opened a cut by Herring's right eye for the second successive fight, and he finished the round with blood streaming down his face. Frampton had never fought anyone as big as Herring and by the fifth round he was looking more confident. But Frampton was stopped suddenly in his tracks after walking on to a left hand and was deposited on his backside for a count. Frampton looked vulnerable for a while, but Herring did not capitalize until the sixth round, when he nailed his challenger with a left uppercut for another count. Herring went for the finish with more than a minute left in the round and threw a series of hooks that left Frampton on shaky legs, prompting his corner to throw in the towel and the fight to be stopped. ""It's tough to see any champion of the sport go out like that,"" Herring said. ""I'm honored to share the ring with him."" Herring later took to Twitter to salute Frampton.

The school announced March 26 that it had launched an investigation amid reports that a rift between Brannen and players had led to the requested transfers. Among the six who entered the transfer portal during a week in March were four members of the 2020 freshman class. Brennan's attorney, Tom Mars, told ESPN in a statement that Cincinnati is mishandling its investigation. ""It's been my experience that collegiate ADs are experts at mishandling internal investigations, and this case is no exception,"" Mars said. ""You don't have to take my word for it. I'm in possession of a communication from within the UC Athletics Department describing the mishandling of this internal investigation in much more descriptive terms. ""There's no basis for Coach Brannen to have been placed on administrative leave -- much less terminated for cause."" Mars added that Brannen would deserve his $5.25 million buyout if athletic director John Cunningham decides to fire him, threatening a lawsuit if the school tries to fire Brannen with cause. ""I'm hopeful, however, that AD Cunningham will wrap up the investigation quickly and reinstate Coach Brannen so that he can continue the great job he's done for Cincinnati basketball,"" Mars said in his statement.

Chicago White Sox DH Yermin Mercedes starts season 8-for-8 to set MLB mark,sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/chicago-white-sox-dh-yermin-mercedes-starts-season/story?id=76862754,"Welcome to the record books,          . The           rookie got three hits in his first three at-bats Saturday against the           to improve to 8-for-8 to start 2021, the most consecutive hits to start a season by any player in the modern era (since 1900). Mercedes, who had one major league at-bat entering the season, going 0-for-1 in 2020, has started at DH the past two games and tortured the Angels with his two-strike hitting -- five of the eight hits have come with two strikes. After homering in the second inning on Saturday for his first career home run, Mercedes' eighth straight hit came in the sixth inning, a double that bounced off the warning track in left-center. ""I'm just trying to wait for my pitch and not do too much,"" Mercedes said after the           in Anaheim. ""Just stay right there and swing hard. It doesn't matter if it is two strikes or no strikes, I just want to see the ball.'' In his ninth at-bat, Mercedes flew out to center field to end his streak. He finished 3-for-4 with two RBIs and a run scored on Saturday. ""All of his hits have been clutch and he has been putting us in position to try to win,"" manager Tony LaRussa said. ""He has had a great approach, especially with two strikes."" Mercedes is a 28-year-old rookie who has bounced around three organizations, originally signed by the Nationals and spending time with the Orioles before the White Sox signed him in 2018. He wasn't expected to be a big part of the lineup, but           's injury has opened up playing time, with projected DH           starting the past two games in left field. LaRussa said Mercedes was supposed to have the night off Saturday but that he earned his way into the lineup with his 5-for-5 night. Mercedes has spent most of his time in the minor leagues at catcher but does own a .302 career minor league average, and in 2019, he hit .317/.388/.581 with 23 home runs in 95 games between Double-A and Triple-A. ""I never imagined that. It is great for me,"" Mercedes said of his start. ""Now, it's a new day for me. I want to keep doing well and work with my approach. I want to play every day and I'm excited for that."" Before Mercedes, the only player since 1900 to get five hits in his first career start was Cecil Travis, who went 5-for-7 for the Washington Senators in 1933. The overall record for consecutive hits at any point in a season is 12, shared by the Cubs' Johnny Kling (1902) and two Red Sox players, Pinky Higgins (1938) and Walt Dropo (1952)."
Canucks add seven players to COVID protocol list as Brazilian variant found in team's outbreak,sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/canucks-add-players-covid-protocol-list-brazilian-variant/story?id=76863122,"The          ' season remains on pause as a growing COVID-19 outbreak that has overwhelmed the team has gone from bad to worse. A source confirmed to ESPN on Saturday night that the more infectious Brazil variant of COVID-19 has been found among several of the cases affecting the Canucks, the first known cases of the new variant among NHL teams this year. That news was first reported by Canada's Postmedia. The news comes hours after the team added seven players to the league's COVID protocol list, bringing the total number of players to 14. Sources told ESPN that two coaches were added to the list, bringing the total number of coaches in the protocol to three. Seven players and a coach were already on the list, prompting the NHL to postpone Canucks games until April 8, with the practice facility opening no sooner than April 6. According to sources, the Canucks' recent additions to the protocol list could keep them out of action even longer. The Vancouver region has recently become a hotspot for the P.1 Brazilian variant of the virus. One source told ESPN that ""there are some players in rough shape tonight."" The Canucks are the second Canadian-based team to have COVID issues. The           had four games postponed in late March, but have since returned to action. The NHL has now postponed 45 games due to COVID, though the first 37 postponements were all for United States-based teams.

UCLA's           scored with 3.3 seconds left to tie the game, and Gonzaga coach Mark Few elected not to call a timeout. Bulldogs forward            grabbed the ball out of the net, while           began to curl toward the ball to catch it on the run. Kispert threw the ball inbounds to Suggs, who took three dribbles and pulled up from about 40 feet to bank in a winning 3 to give Gonzaga a 93-90 overtime win over UCLA on Saturday at Lucas Oil Stadium, advancing the Bulldogs to Monday's national championship game          . Suggs fist-pumped into the air and sprinted to the scorer's table as his teammates mobbed him. ""I've always wanted to run up on the table like Kobe and D-Wade and go like that, and that's the first thing I did,"" said Suggs, Gonzaga's star guard. ""Man, that is something that you practice on your mini-hoop as a kid or in the gym just messing around. And to be able to do that, it's crazy."" The Zags' quest for an unbeaten national championship season survived, just barely. ""It helps when you have a magical, special guy like Jalen,"" Few said. UCLA's Cinderella run through the NCAA tournament nearly took down another victim, as the 11-seed Bruins gave Gonzaga all it could handle and then some. There were 19 lead changes, and the biggest lead for either team was Gonzaga's seven-point edge in the second half. The Bulldogs had barely been tested all season, with 29 of their 30 wins entering Saturday coming by double-digits. It was clear from the outset that wouldn't be the case in the national semifinals. UCLA matched Gonzaga basket for basket in the first half, even taking a six-point lead with 4:55 remaining until halftime. Bruins coach Mick Cronin once again had a masterclass in game planning, limiting Gonzaga's transition opportunities and refusing to push the ball on fast breaks, even when the Bruins might have had an advantage. They ran the shot clock down on nearly every possession and made tough shots all night. Before his buzzer shot, Suggs had already made a case for the play of the tournament. With two minutes left in regulation, he came from behind and blocked what looked like an easy basket for          . He kept the ball inbounds, then pushed it upcourt before threading the needle with a one-handed bounce pass to           for a dunk. Instead of a two-point deficit, Gonzaga had a two-point lead. ""I couldn't give him a free bucket,"" Suggs said of Riley. ""Either I was going to find him at the line or make a play on the ball. I went to the corner, it was tough to get it. I got it. I saw Drew running, and           is fast. I wanted to throw it. It looked wide open. And then as soon as I let it go out of my hands, he had like another gear. It made it a lot closer than I wanted it to be. I knew Coach was maybe a little pissed that I made the pass, but it got through."" ""He's a hell of a player. I mean, he's electric,"" Few said of Suggs. ""Especially when you get him out in transition. He's confident enough. And to make that pass to Timme. When I saw him sizing it up, I was not thinking it was going to be one of his greatest decisions he's ever had. But he's got a knack for just fitting things into small windows."" Juzang was again outstanding for UCLA, continuing the stellar stretch he has had all NCAA tournament. He was unguardable at times, finishing with 29 points, the fourth time in the tournament he has scored at least 23 points. And it looked like he might deliver another shocking upset win over a 1-seed late in regulation, when he drove the lane and drew a whistle with 1.1 seconds left. But instead of a fifth foul on Timme, it was a charge on Juzang and five more minutes to play. ""[Timme is] our best charge-taker by far. I mean, I don't know how I felt about that, with four fouls,"" Few said. ""But he took it, God bless him, and it was a big play."" Timme was exceptional in the extra period, scoring Gonzaga's first six points to give the Bulldogs some breathing room. But as it did all game, UCLA kept fighting and had possession following a missed 3 by Corey Kispert with 22 seconds left. Juzang drove the lane and missed a runner, but he got his own miss and put it back to tie the score with 3.3 seconds left. Gonzaga had one timeout remaining, but Few wasn't going to use it. Suggs made one of the greatest shots in NCAA tournament history and sent the Zags to Monday night's title game. ""I knew we were good because it was in Jalen's hands,"" Few said. ""He makes shots. He's got that magical aura. He makes them in practice all the time. It's been crazy this year how many he's made in practice, last-second shots. I felt pretty good. I was staring right at it. And I said, 'It's in.' And it was."" Suggs, a former high school football star, said his greatest all-time sports moment entering college was a high school football championship his senior year. He has a new one now. ""It skyrockets above that,"" said Suggs, who could barely contain his joy in the postgame news conference. ""I mean, it was nuts. And I still can't speak. I have so many things going on in my head. I just can't believe that happened. I don't think it's really going to hit me until I wake up tomorrow. Tonight was special."" ""When dreams start to become realities and you're able to experience those things, it's special,"" he later added. ""And those are things you've got to cherish. You're never going to get another moment like this. You'll never be able to relive this."" So now on Monday we get the game college basketball has wanted since the season began, the game we were denied in early December because of COVID-19: Gonzaga vs. Baylor. It will be the first time since 2005 the top two teams on the NCAA tournament's 1-68 seed list will face each other in the national championship game. ""I think now they're back playing the way they were earlier this year,"" Few said. ""And so well-coached. Stepping up, making shots. Playing great defense. ... We've got to get ready for a terrific Baylor team. And we're going to have to play great."" Forty minutes to perfection and a place in history."

Kispert threw the ball in bounds to Suggs, who took three dribbles and pulled up from about 40 feet to bank in a buzzer-beating 3 to give Gonzaga a           over the 11-seed Bruins on Saturday at Lucas Oil Stadium, advancing the Bulldogs to Monday's national championship game          . Suggs fist-pumped into the air and sprinted to the scorer's table as his teammates mobbed him. ""I've always wanted to run up on the table like Kobe and D-Wade and go like that, and that's the first thing I did,"" said Suggs, Gonzaga's star guard. ""Man, that is something that you practice on your mini-hoop as a kid or in the gym just messing around. And to be able to do that, it's crazy."" The Zags' quest for an unbeaten national championship season survived, just barely. ""It helps when you have a magical, special guy like Jalen,"" Few said. UCLA's Cinderella run through the NCAA tournament nearly took down another victim, as the Bruins gave Gonzaga (31-0) all it could handle and then some. There were 19 lead changes, and the biggest lead for either team was Gonzaga's seven-point edge in the second half. The Bulldogs had barely been tested all season, with 29 of their 30 wins entering Saturday coming by double digits. It was clear from the outset that wouldn't be the case in the national semifinals. UCLA matched Gonzaga basket for basket in the first half, even taking a six-point lead with 4 minutes, 55 seconds remaining until halftime. Bruins coach Mick Cronin once again had a masterclass in game planning, limiting Gonzaga's transition opportunities and refusing to push the ball on fast breaks, even when the Bruins might have had an advantage. They ran the shot clock down on nearly every possession and made tough shots all night. Before his buzzer shot, Suggs had already made a case for the play of the tournament. With two minutes left in regulation, he came from behind and blocked what looked like an easy basket for          . He kept the ball inbounds, then pushed it upcourt before threading the needle with a one-handed bounce pass to           for a dunk. Instead of a two-point deficit, Gonzaga had a two-point lead. ""I couldn't give him a free bucket,"" Suggs said of Riley. ""Either I was going to find him at the line or make a play on the ball. I went to the corner -- it was tough to get it. I got it. I saw Drew running, and           is fast. I wanted to throw it. It looked wide open. And then as soon as I let it go out of my hands, he had like another gear. It made it a lot closer than I wanted it to be. I knew Coach was maybe a little pissed that I made the pass, but it got through."" ""He's a hell of a player. I mean, he's electric,"" Few said of Suggs. ""Especially when you get him out in transition. He's confident enough. And to make that pass to Timme. When I saw him sizing it up, I was not thinking it was going to be one of his greatest decisions he's ever had. But he's got a knack for just fitting things into small windows."" Juzang was again outstanding for UCLA, continuing the stellar stretch he has had all NCAA tournament. He was unguardable at times, finishing with 29 points, the fourth time in the tournament he has scored at least 23 points. And it looked like he might deliver another shocking upset win over a 1-seed late in regulation when he drove the lane and drew a whistle with 1.1 seconds left. But instead of a fifth foul on Timme, it was a charge on Juzang and five more minutes to play. ""[Timme is] our best charge-taker by far. I mean, I don't know how I felt about that, with four fouls,"" Few said. ""But he took it, God bless him, and it was a big play."" Timme was exceptional in the extra period, scoring Gonzaga's first six points to give the Bulldogs some breathing room. But as it did all game, UCLA kept fighting and had possession following a missed 3 by Kispert with 22 seconds left. Juzang drove the lane and missed a runner, but he got his own miss and put it back to tie the score with 3.3 seconds left. Gonzaga had one timeout remaining, but Few wasn't going to use it. Suggs made one of the greatest shots in NCAA tournament history and sent the Zags to Monday night's title game. ""I knew we were good because it was in Jalen's hands,"" Few said. ""He makes shots. He's got that magical aura. He makes them in practice all the time. It's been crazy this year how many he's made in practice, last-second shots. I felt pretty good. I was staring right at it. And I said, 'It's in.' And it was."" Suggs, a former high school football star, said his greatest all-time sports moment entering college was a high school football championship his senior year. He has a new one now. ""It skyrockets above that,"" said Suggs, who could barely contain his joy in the postgame news conference. ""I mean, it was nuts. And I still can't speak. I have so many things going on in my head. I just can't believe that happened. I don't think it's really going to hit me until I wake up tomorrow. Tonight was special. ""When dreams start to become realities and you're able to experience those things, it's special,"" he later added. ""And those are things you've got to cherish. You're never going to get another moment like this. You'll never be able to relive this."" So now on Monday, we get the game college basketball has wanted since the season began, the game we were denied in early December because of COVID-19: Gonzaga vs. Baylor. It will be the first time since 2005 the top two teams on the NCAA tournament's 1-68 seed list will face each other in the national championship game. ""I think now they're back playing the way they were earlier this year,"" Few said. ""And so well coached. Stepping up, making shots. Playing great defense. ... We've got to get ready for a terrific Baylor team. And we're going to have to play great."" Forty minutes to perfection and a place in history."
Canucks add seven players to COVID-19 protocol list as Brazilian variant found in team's outbreak,sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/canucks-add-players-covid-19-protocol-list-brazilian/story?id=76863158,"The          ' season remains on pause as a growing COVID-19 outbreak that has overwhelmed the team has gone from bad to worse. A source confirmed to ESPN on Saturday night that the more infectious Brazil variant of COVID-19 has been found among several of the cases affecting the Canucks, the first known cases of the new variant among NHL teams this year. That news was first reported by Canada's Postmedia. The news came hours after the team added seven players to the league's COVID-19 protocol list, bringing the total number of players to 14. Sources told ESPN that two coaches were added to the list, bringing the total number of coaches in the protocol to three. Seven players and a coach were already on the list, prompting the NHL to postpone Canucks games until April 8, with the practice facility opening no sooner than April 6. According to sources, the Canucks' recent additions to the protocol list could keep them out of action even longer. The Vancouver region has recently become a hotspot for the P.1 Brazilian variant of the virus. One source told ESPN that ""there are some players in rough shape tonight."" The Canucks are the second Canadian-based team to have COVID-19 issues. The           had four games postponed in late March but have since returned to action. The NHL has now postponed 45 games because of COVID-19, though the first 37 postponements were all for United States-based teams. For Vancouver, the issue began on Tuesday when           was pulled from practice following a positive test result, which was confirmed positive later that evening.           joined Gaudette on the protocol list on Thursday. By Friday,          ,          ,          ,           and           were all added to the list as well, following additional testing and contract tracing. Gaudette's wife, Micaela, tweeted on Thursday: ""My hubby isn't in great shape but I'm taking good care of him!"" Micaela Gaudette also tweeted: ""A human being gets sick with a virus we don't know much about and y'all are angry at him because you can't watch a hockey game."" ,          ,          ,          ,          ,          , and           were added to the list on Saturday."
'Doom' fears bring grim reminders of COVID realities: The Note,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doom-fears-bring-grim-reminders-covid-realities-note/story?id=76751707,"The message  : wear a mask,  , listen to experts. And it appears to be working. But the   by the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as echoed by President Joe Biden, are reminders of the precarious nature of this moment regarding  . The Biden White House is now battling complacency in addition to politics, and   any sense that the pandemic is over. ""The war against COVID-19 is far from won,"" Biden said Monday, in encouraging governors to keep or reinstate mask mandates and announcing a strategic change in federal vaccination programs. ""As much as we're doing, America, it's time to do even more."" Polls have consistently   in Biden's leadership on COVID and vaccine distribution. But they have also shown partisan splits in willingness to follow   officials' recommendations, as Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell hinted at Monday in specifically encouraging ""Republican men"" to get vaccinated. On Tuesday, the World Health Organization is formally releasing its investigation into the origins of the pandemic. With former Trump administration officials making news with candid assessments about how the early months were handled, it might feel like a moment to look back instead of look forward. Five days ago, Biden stood for more than   and   about COVID. You can blame a relentless news cycle, or reporters for not asking about it, or even take that as a good sign about the country's mood at the moment. Biden would love to talk about other priorities, including the   he is set to outline Wednesday. But he needs to keep talking about the pandemic, as he and his aides are quite aware. Overnight, the seven-week-long voting period at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, came to a close. But in what has become   throughout pandemic-era elections, the results of this count won't be known for at least another week as more than 5,800   face the prospects of creating the first union at an   in the United States. The tabulation delay is likely to stem from challenges over factors like improper job classification or ineligibility due to employment dates. Both Amazon and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union -- the group from which Bessemer facility workers in favor of unionizing are   -- can raise these concerns before the vote tally is finalized. Beyond Alabama, the Bessemer warehouse election has already put labor law reform on the political map by giving common ground to the White House and party progressives. Biden   with a supportive video   last month, in which he reiterated his administration's policy of supporting union organization and collective bargaining. Meanwhile, high-profile progressives mobilized to highlight the impact of the pandemic on the working conditions of the predominantly Black workers at the Bessemer facility, which culminated in a Friday visit from Sen. Bernie Sanders, one of the most vocal political   of Amazon's attempts to block unionization. ""This campaign has already been a victory in many ways. Even though we don't know how the vote will turn out, we believe we have opened the door to more organizing around the country,"" Stuart Appelbaum, president of the RWDSU said in a statement. After a censure by the state GOP and a vow to unseat her, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, is facing her first potential   in Kelly Tshibaka. Alaska's all-party primary and ranked-choice general election means that Tshibaka won't face Murkowski directly in a primary, but her campaign launch made clear who she is running against, calling out Murkowski for her decision to vote with ""D.C. insiders."" Murkowski crossed party lines in February when she   former President Donald Trump with incitement of insurrection. Trump unleashed his ire on Murkowski the same way he did with   who   or convict him by   to those who   until the very end. Tshibaka makes no mention of Trump in her campaign launch, something unique as Trump allies have been jumping into high-profile congressional races across the country, but she did appear to side with him on the issue of election integrity by espousing a number of false theories about fraud in the November election. Trump hasn't weighed in on the   aside from a promise to unseat Murkowski, but it appears Tshibaka will have the backing of top Trump advisers:   reported Monday afternoon that former Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, along with a number of other Trump alums, will serve as advisers to her campaign. After early primary defeats in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, Joe Biden staked his bid for the presidency on the voters of South Carolina. They delivered for him; now, many are looking to him to return the favor. Biden has surpassed two months in the White House and   returned to the state that helped reinvigorate his faltering 2020 campaign to   about where he is meeting expectations, where he may be missing the mark and their feelings about the direction of the country in the post-Donald Trump era.

"Accused of drug trafficking, Honduran president a critical challenge for Biden's immigration plans",politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/accused-drug-trafficking-honduran-president-critical-challenge-bidens/story?id=76678729,"Vice President Kamala Harris will begin calling leaders from Central America this week as she takes the lead for the Biden administration on tackling a surge in migration to the southern U.S. border. But one of those calls will be particularly delicate because she'll be talking to a head of state who acts more like a narcotrafficker, U.S. prosecutors in New York have alleged. President Juan Orlando Hernandez of Honduras has been cast as a co-conspirator in a federal drug trafficking trial this month. His associate, now a convicted drug kingpin, has alleged that Hernandez accepted millions of dollars in bribes and helped protect a flood of cocaine into the U.S. Hernandez has not been charged and denied the allegations, even distorting State Department data about drug trafficking in his country to claim, ""HUGE SUCCESS!"" Many of the migrants reaching the southern U.S. border are fleeing violence, drugs and corruption in Honduras under Hernandez's watch. In light of the allegations against him, there is growing pressure on the Biden administration to change its approach to Hernandez, who claimed victory in a close 2017 re-election race that was marred by allegations of fraud -- but for which he received U.S. backing from the Trump administration. A State Department spokesperson told ABC News that the Biden administration is dedicated ""to fighting corruption in Honduras and we will support and work with leaders who are committed to these same goals."" But they would not say whether Hernandez is such a leader, criticize him directly or say if the administration sees him as part of the problem. Instead, they added their commitment ""to work with partner governments who are ready to make the needed political, rule-of-law and economic reforms that are essential to success."" President Joe Biden has pledged a $4 billion, multi-year investment project in Central America's so-called ""Northern Triangle"" -- Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The majority of migrants to the U.S. border are from one of these three countries, traversing through their larger neighbor Mexico and fleeing high rates of violence and gang activity, few jobs or opportunities, and much insecurity. The investment is in its earliest stages and has not yet been appropriated by Congress, but the Biden administration may move quickly with some funding as it faces a record increase of unaccompanied minors crossing the U.S.-Mexican border. Harris will oversee an effort to not only stem the flow of migrants, according to the White House, but also establish a ""strategic partnership"" with Mexico and the Northern Triangle ""to enhance prosperity, combat corruption and strengthen the rule of law."" Given the allegations against him by U.S. prosecutors, some analysts say it is hard to see how Hernandez can be part of that. He has been repeatedly named in the trial of Honduran drug trafficker Geovanny Fuentes Ramirez this month. U.S. attorneys for the Southern District of New York alleged that he accepted bribes from Fuentes to facilitate tons of cocaine to the U.S. while a presidential candidate and leader of Honduras' congress in 2013. While appearing to cooperate with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, Hernandez reportedly vowed to tear up Honduras' extradition treaty with the U.S. and ""stuff drugs up the gringos' noses,"" prosecutors said. In addition to Fuentes, Hernandez's brother Tony Hernandez, also a Honduran congressman, was convicted in October 2019 of drug trafficking charges and lying to the Drug Enforcement Agency. He is scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday for up to life in prison. While the State Department declined to directly criticize Hernandez, it said none of Biden's $4 billion investment will go directly to governments in the region, including Hernandez's, but to civil society, religious organizations, international organizations and nongovernmental organizations. ""This is not a blank check,"" the department spokesperson added. ""Addressing the region's daunting challenges requires systemic change and political will from the leaders of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Combating corruption and impunity is at the center of our strategy for the region. Central America will never live up to its full potential without addressing endemic corruption."" But they would not say how they'll do that, especially with Hernandez in power -- except that they have ""robust"" ways to monitor how funds are spent and they ""will use all available tools, including visa restrictions, to promote accountability for corrupt actors."" Whether that extends to a head of government remains to be seen. While U.S. prosecutors have directly implicated Hernandez, charging him would be a highly unusual move to make against a foreign head of government. Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro was charged in March 2020 by the Justice Department for drug trafficking too, but the Trump administration no longer recognized him as Venezuelan president. Hernandez also said earlier this month that State Department data provides an ""instant rebuttal of the false narrative"" against him -- tweeting that his ""government dramatically lowered the drug rate from 87% to 4%... a reduction of 95.4%"" But that distorts data from the State Department's annual reports on international narcotics control. In 2013, it said that up to ""87 percent of all cocaine smuggling flights departing south America first land in Honduras,"" a key transit point for narcotrafficking because of how remote and ungoverned its north coast is. In the 2020 report, that number drop to 4%, but largely because ""more is assessed to have transited through Honduras by land after making a first arrival in other countries."" The State Department declined to comment on Hernandez's claim, but its 2020 narcotics report highlights cooperation with the Honduran government despite the prosecutors' allegations. ""The political will of the Honduran government to combat drug trafficking in coordination with U.S. law enforcement agencies continues,"" the report said. ""The Government of Honduras does not, as a matter of official government policy, encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs."" The problem runs much deeper than Hernandez, too. Yani Rosenthal, the front-runner to be one of the two major party's presidential nominee, was released from U.S. prison in August after serving three years for money laundering, while several other candidates in the country's primaries earlier this month were under investigation for corruption. Critically, one of the reasons Hernandez remains in power now is because of prior U.S. backing. After removing the country's limit of two presidential terms, Hernandez claimed victory in 2017 in a narrow contest that international election observers from the Organization of American States and the European Union said was fraudulent. The Trump administration, however, stood by Hernandez in the face of widespread protests and a bloody government response that left dozens dead. The State Department said there were ""irregularities identified by the OAS and the EU,"" but called for ""robust national dialogue ... to heal the political divide"" and congratulated Hernandez. Lawmakers back then opposed Trump's support for Hernandez, and this week, a group of Democrats have stepped forward to urge Biden to reconsider the U.S. partnership with Hernandez. Rep. Norma Torres, a leading U.S. lawmaker on Central American issues and a Guatemalan native, wrote to Biden's team this week to stop ""sending money to directly to the hands of corrupt officials"" like Hernandez. Last month, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., introduced a bill to impose sanctions on Hernandez and suspend U.S. security assistance and export licenses for certain defense-related items to the country."
Students successfully lobby for new state law excusing them from school to protest,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/students-successfully-lobby-state-law-excusing-school-protest/story?id=76736167,"Middle and high school students across Virginia will soon be excused from school to participate in a protest or civic event thanks to a bipartisan group of students from Virginia Young Democrats and Virginia Teenage Republicans who joined forces to successfully lobby for the new law, which started as a school board policy in Fairfax County. The policy, which goes into effect July 1, grants students an excused absence from school one day a year to ""engage in a civic or political event."" School districts in other states have passed similar policies, but Virginia is the first to pass one statewide. ""There's this misconception that it's only about protests, that it's only about walking out,"" said Virginia Young Democrats Teen Caucus Chair Matthew Savage, 17. ""But it's also about just getting a sense of what your government is and trying to make a difference -- meeting with legislators, attending protests -- it's much more."" Savage decided to lobby his representatives to take the 2019 Fairfax County initiative statewide after seeing another policy his school district piloted -- requiring free menstrual products in schools -- had passed the Virginia legislature. He strategized with other Young Democrats and began reaching out to lawmakers, including Democrats Del. Sam Rasoul and state Sen. Jennifer McClellan, who committed to introducing it. ""It's critically important for us not to just encourage the youth to vote, but to actually empower them and have them involved in the civic process and what better way than to have them help draft bills -- which is what happened here -- help them lobby and then help them actually pass these bills,"" Rasoul said. McClellan said she chose to sponsor the legislation to stoke the students' interests. ""There is no substitute for live action, and by participating in civic events, they come alive in a way they just can't in a book or in a lecture in the classroom, so it will spark a passion in them that hopefully will keep them engaged,"" McClellan said. Savage also reached out to his Republican counterparts who agreed to collaborate on the bill. ""I don't think that this bill is liberal or conservative, I think it just helps students, it helps teenagers across the commonwealth get more involved, and that's something we all need to be working towards,"" said Teenage Republican Federation of Virginia Chairman Brady Hillis, 17. Republican Del. Glenn Davis decided to co-sponsor the legislation after the GOP students reached out to him. ""In a time that is so partisan in our nation right now, to see teenage Republicans and teenage Democrats come together to work together on a bill … sometimes you have to look at the next generation to see really how the adults should be acting,"" Davis said. Not every Republican in the Virginia General Assembly was so moved. ""I'm all for educating and getting more people involved in civics but school and education is a lot more important,"" said Republican Del. Wendell Walker. Republican Del. John Avoli said he encourages student engagement in civics but believes local school boards should be making these decisions. Mia Tilman, now an 18-year-old freshman at the College William and Mary, used the Fairfax County policy when she was a high school senior to lobby for the Equal Rights Amendment in Washington. She said she is not sure she would have done so if her absence was unexcused because she was concerned about blemishing her record while she was applying to colleges. Student athletes and students involved in academic clubs are excused from school for sports games and academic conferences, but there was no equivalent for a student interested in politics and civic action, Tilman said. ""To me, protesting is my academics, it is what I want to do with the rest of my life, and it holds just as much value to me as someone going to an athletic tournament to pursue their career,"" Tilman said. High school junior Makenzie Hymes, 16, also used the Fairfax policy to lobby for the ERA. ""There's so much you can learn outside of the classroom,"" Hymes said of her visit to the U.S. Capitol. ""(In) that type of environment, the littlest thing is like a whole life lesson."" Savage used the Fairfax County policy in order skip class and testify on the bill virtually before the state's House Education Committee. Gov. Ralph Northam signed the bill into law on March 12. Savage said students from both parties in other states have begun reaching out to him, saying they are trying to work with their legislators to introduce a similar bill in their state. ""Virginia has taken a national leadership role and is a goldfish bowl for the rest of the country in terms of civic engagement now,"" Savage said."

Major ""nipped"" a National Park Service employee on the White House South Lawn on Monday afternoon, first lady Jill Biden's press secretary, Michael LaRosa, told ABC News in a statement Tuesday. ""Out of an abundance of caution,"" the employee went to the White House medical unit for treatment before returning to work ""without injury,"" LaRosa said. “Major is still adjusting to his new surroundings,"" he added.

""And he moves to protect,"" the president said of Major. ""But he's a sweet dog. Eighty-five percent of the people there love him."" Major was spotted on a walk with a White House staff member on the South Lawn on Monday evening, before Biden departed for his visit to the Vietnam War Memorial. The dog was leashed."
Biden's 'paradigm' shift gets new tests among Democrats: The Note,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bidens-paradigm-shift-tests-democrats-note/story?id=76772268,"The $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill got more attention and its goals may matter more in addressing the  . But President Joe Biden's two-phase   will carry a larger price tag along with potentially greater implications. The president is set to start outlining his proposal Wednesday in Pittsburgh -- the same city where he   -- in the midst of a defining challenge to his vow to ""change the paradigm."" The action will be primarily, if not exclusively, inside his own party. Both Biden and Democratic congressional leaders are   Republican buy-in, and they know that even bending or changing Senate rules only matters if Democrats are almost entirely on board with the plan. That plan will include billions upon billions for things like roads, bridges and broadband. Billions more would flow toward what progressives have categorized as ""human infrastructure"" -- paid family leave, college access, housing, elder care -- all while seeking to deliver on climate-change and social-justice goals. As for how it would be funded, pockets of Democrats are already staking out territory about what new taxes should be in and what should be out. While some   and   massive tax hike -- albeit one aimed at the rich and corporations -- others are already saying the president should be spending more as opposed to less. ""We think there is ample room to get the number up,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the House Progressive Caucus, told reporters Tuesday. Biden's proposals will be scored, amended and picked apart. But if he is to make good on what he's promising, he'll need to navigate complex intra-party dynamics to get to the payoff. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is doubling down on the sweeping voting legislation he   last week as the fallout from it continues. Calls to boycott Georgia-based companies are growing and the arrest of a Black state lawmaker inflamed an already fierce response. In an interview with Atlanta   Tuesday, Kemp criticized his opponents who describe the law as voter suppression that disproportionately impacts voters of color. He dismissed organizations pointing to Georgia's record of discriminatory voting practices and diminished   about equitable access to the ballot box as a form of  ""cancel culture."" ""I knew what was coming from the other side. I knew that they were going to try to do this boycott, cancel culture and everything else,"" Kemp said. Kemp maintained that the bill makes it ""easy to vote and hard to cheat,""   this week by civil rights groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and other organizations interprets the new law very differently. The groups argue that it will disenfranchise voters including people of color, new citizens and religious communities. The coalition is asking the court to strike it down. The resolution remains to be seen, but whatever the court decides   far beyond the Peach State as Republican state lawmakers   have filed bills to roll back voting access.

Supreme Court questions NCAA limits on student athlete compensation ,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-questions-ncaa-limits-student-athlete-compensation/story?id=76791975,"With   in full swing, the   on Wednesday faced off against a group of   at the U.S. Supreme Court in a long-running dispute over limits on education-related  . The NCAA and its biggest, most lucrative   want the justices to overturn a ruling abolishing the limits, saying it would erode the amateur nature of college sports and open the door to ""pay for play.""  argue the rules unfairly suppress their ability to be rewarded for valuable skills and abilities in violation of federal antitrust law. The case is one of the biggest tests in decades for the NCAA and its limits on athlete compensation, and it could dramatically alter the nature of college sports, some experts said. While the NCAA allows schools to provide full tuition, room and board for athletes, it places limits on education-related benefits such as computers, paid internships and summer abroad programs which can value tens of thousands of dollars. ""In the present world, as the district court recognized, we permit student athletes to receive the 'actual and necessary' educational expenses,"" NCAA attorney Seth Waxman told the justices during oral arguments in the case. ""And the (lower) court said 'no, you can't place any limit on that' ... that permits schools to allow pay for play."" Waxman argued that amateurism is a defining feature of college sports and that lifting caps on compensation would create ""a regime in which student athletes can be paid large sums of money on account of their athletic performance, which does not distinguish college from professional sports."" A majority of justices appeared concerned by the association's position. Chief Justice John Roberts noted the tens of thousands of dollars in insurance policies some schools pay for their athletes. ""Doesn't that undercut amateurism?"" he said. Justice Clarence Thomas noted the disparity between coaches' salaries and what players are allowed to receive. ""it strikes me as odd that the coaches' salaries have ballooned and they're in the amateur ranks as are the players,"" Thomas said. Justice Samuel Alito showed empathy for athletes, who he said ""lead a pretty hard life"" and face ""shockingly low graduation rates."" ""So the argument is they are recruited, they're used up and they're cast aside without even a college degree. So they say, how can this be defended in the name of amateurism?"" Alito said. Justice Elena Kagan accused the NCAA of ""very high-minded"" talk of amateurism when the schools have essentially ""gotten together into an organization that has undisputed market power and they use that power to fix athletic salaries at extremely low levels."" Justice   said plainly that ""anti-trust law should not be a cover for exploitation of student athletes."" But several justices also voiced support for the association's need to maintain a distinction in college sports. Roberts worried aloud that rolling back too many limits on student athlete compensation could be ""like a game of Jenga."" ""You pull out one log and then another, and everything's fine, then another and another and all of a sudden the whole thing comes crashing down."" ""I worry a lot about judges getting into the business of deciding how amateur sports should be run,"" added Justice Stephen Breyer. Thomas said he was ""perplexed"" about how to ensure ""an important distinction between student athletes and professional athletes without (the NCAA) constantly being involved in litigation."" The athletes' attorney, Jeffrey Kessler, repeatedly sought to assure the court that the nature of college sports would not be altered by ending the cap on education-related expenses covered by schools. ""We heard over and over again that each loss was going to destroy college sports … it's never happened,"" Kessler said. ""We're not challenging any restrictions or rules regarding that they have to be students. And, in fact, the education-related benefits here would help them to succeed as students."" The court is expected to hand down a decision in the case by the end of June."
2 Capitol Police officers sue Trump for physical and emotional injuries from Jan. 6 riot,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/capitol-police-officers-sue-trump-physical-emotional-injuries/story?id=76784999,"Two Capitol Police officers filed a civil suit Tuesday against former President   for physical and emotional injuries they say they suffered as a result of the  . In the lawsuit, James Blassingame, a 17-year veteran of the force, and Sidney Hemby, who has served as a Capitol Police officer for 11 years, quote Trump's words leading up to the riot, including Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud and his assertion that Democrats were ""trying to steal"" the  . The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., demands an award of at least $75,000 for each officer for each of the five alleged counts against Trump, as well as punitive damages and costs associated with the litigation. The counts include directing assault and battery, aiding and abetting assault and battery, directing intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violating D.C. statutes against incitement of a riot and disorderly conduct. A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. Officer Blassingame was one of ""eight or nine"" officers who rioters confronted in the crypt of the  , directly below the rotunda, the suit alleges. ""The insurrectionists were throwing items, and striking Officer Blassingame and the other USCP officers with their fists and weapons,"" the complaint alleges, as a ""front line of insurrectionists was being pressed from behind by waves of newly arriving insurrectionists."" A ""forceful surge of insurrectionists pushed forward and slammed Officer Blassingame against a stone column,"" striking his spine and the back of his head, leaving him ""unable to move,"" the suit alleges. ""Foremost in Officer Blassingame's mind was the terrifying certainty that the insurrectionists were interested in him and the other officers not going home to their families that night,"" the lawsuit claims. The suit also makes a claim similar to what Capitol Police officer   told ABC News Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas about the racial slurs hurled at officers who were on duty that day. ""For the first time in [Officer Blassingame's] life, people were yelling into his face, calling him a [n-word] repeatedly and throughout the attack in the crypt. He lost count of the many times the racial slur was hurled at him,"" the suit alleges. The allegations in the suit paint an ugly, violent and vivid picture of the attacks it says Blassingame endured. ""The insurrectionists struck Officer Blassingame in his face, head, chest, arms, and what felt like every part of his body,"" it says. ""Insurrectionists used their fists and had weapons that ranged from flagpoles to stanchions and building directional signs, water bottles and other objects he could not identify."" Blassingame's ""sole focus was to do what he could to survive,"" the suit claims. Blassingame alleges that he suffered back and head injuries and ""is haunted by the memory of being attacked, and of the sensory impacts -- the sights, sounds, smells and even tastes of the attack remain close to the surface."" The suit also alleges that Blassingame ""experiences guilt of being unable to help his colleagues who were simultaneously being attacked; and of surviving where other colleagues did not."" Following the attack, Blassingame ""was not able to sleep,"" claims the suit, and he allegedly suffered from ""depression that he could not address because he was too consumed with a sense of continued obligation to continue on with his professional responsibilities."" Because he continues to work in the Capitol, ""he is unable to avoid most of the triggers of his emotional reactions,"" the suit claims. Officer Hemby, the suit alleges, was ""crushed against the doors on the east side trying to hold the insurrectionists back,"" and that the rioters ""continued to scream, 'Fight for Trump,' 'Stop the steal,' and various other slogans, as they struck him with their fists and whatever they had in their hands."" Hemby also endured being ""sprayed with chemicals that irritated his eyes, skin, and throat,"" the suit alleges. The suit alleges Hemby was ""bleeding from a cut located less than an inch from his eye"" and that he ""had cuts and abrasions on his face and hands, and his body was pinned against a large metal door."" As a result of the attack, the suit claims that Hemby's ""left hand and left knee became swollen and painful,"" and that he suffers from back and neck pain and that his skin was burned from being ""sprayed in the face and body with chemical sprays."" Hemby also claims in the suit that he now suffers from trouble sleeping. The lawsuit cites a litany of Trump's tweets and public statements leading up to the attack, including his call for a ""wild"" protest on Jan. 6 and his promotion of ""the baseless idea that Vice President Mike Pence could single-handedly reject the election outcome based on false claims that some states wanted to 'decertify' or 'correct' election results that were not in Trump's favor."" The suit also cites the words of a number of prominent Republican lawmakers who place the blame for the riot on Trump, including Sen. Mitt Romney, Rep. Liz Cheney and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who after voting to acquit Trump on the charge of inciting the insurrection, took to the Senate floor on Feb. 13 and made clear his belief that Trump was responsible for the Capitol riot. ""There's no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,"" McConnell said. ""The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president, and having that belief was a foreseeable consequence of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories and reckless hyperbole which the defeated president kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet Earth."" What McConnell said next is also cited in the suit, in support of how Trump may still be held accountable for his actions even though he's no longer in office. ""President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office, as an ordinary citizen, unless the statute of limitations has run, still liable for everything he did while in office, didn't get away with anything yet -- yet,"" McConnell said. ""We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one."""
South Dakota governor's ban on transgender athletes at center of emerging GOP culture war,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/south-dakota-governors-ban-transgender-athletes-center-emerging/story?id=76793497,"A series of culture wars that are likely to resurface on future campaign trails appear to be emerging in several Republican-led states   of transgender rights, despite the next two cycles of elections being several  . South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem -- who is widely considered to be a possible 2024 presidential aspirant -- is the latest official to be at the center of debates surrounding a groundswell of bills that aim to ban transgender students from playing on school sports teams according to the gender with which they identify. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, similar types of bills have made their way through more than a dozen states, including   laws in Tennessee and Mississippi. Noem's attempt to take on the highly sensitive topic had a rocky start, despite her having expressed initial excitement at the prospect of ""defending women's sports"" in signing HB 1217 --  her state's version of a bill that sought to ban transgender women and girls from playing on female sport teams. This week, Noem killed that bill after failing to come to a compromise with state lawmakers regarding revisions to what she called ""serious drafting errors"" which she believes made the bill ""significantly different from any other state legislation pending across the country."" In a letter addressed to the state's legislative leaders on Monday, Noem expressed her concerns over the bill's language having consequences beyond protecting ""fairness in women's sports."" The concerns included worries that the bill would have ""turned any failure to make a sports team into a litigation hazard,"" while also implementing the need for parents to complete a yearly ""onerous paperwork requirement"" to identify school-aged children's genders and whether their child had taken performance-enhancing drugs. Noem also pointed to the bill's likely impact on collegiate athletics, which could have put state athletes at odds with the oversight implemented by national athletic organizations. ""South Dakota has shown that our student athletes can compete with anyone in the country, but competing on the national stage means compliance with the national governing bodies that oversee collegiate athletics,"" Noem wrote in a series of recent tweets. ""While I certainly do not always agree with the actions these sanctioning bodies take, I understand that collegiate athletics requires such a system -- a fifty-state patchwork is not workable."" Although the South Dakota governor's two executive orders do not explicitly include references to transgender athletes, they do refer to ""current policies that allow males to participate in women's athletics."" Noem said the orders ""temporarily address the problem"" and that she wants to see a special legislative session come together in the coming months to further address these issues through legislation. While Noem and other supporters of similar efforts see these policies as vehicles for protecting their notions of fairness in women's sports, the political push in South Dakota appears to be at odds with the current number of trans athletes it would presumably impact. According to data provided by the Transformation Project, a transgender youth advocacy group in South Dakota, there are only a handful of trans athletes across the state -- among them are five trans male athletes and no trans girl athletes. The evolution of Noem's stance on her state legislature's initial bill opened the door for intraparty criticism. Some social conservatives like the Family Policy Alliance seized on her perceived presidential aspirations by implying that her decision to oppose the bill could have larger political repercussions. ""It's no secret that Gov. Noem has national aspirations, so it's time she hears from a national audience,"" the group wrote in a press release to supporters. Editors at  , a conservative news magazine, called Noem's moves a ""disappointing capitulation"" and alleged the governor engaged in ""a flagrant violation of her powers"" for making ""sweeping substantive changes rather than small stylistic ones"" in her executive orders. The editors went on to call it a ""classic case of a politician motivated by immediate financial incentives (in this case, avoiding expensive lawsuits and potential boycotts) acting rashly on an issue she knows and cares little about, only to quickly realize that this was drastically out of step with her party and her base, and then frantically set about justifying her decision."" Noem stood her ground in a subsequent   published by the magazine. As LGBTQ advocates laud the outcome of the political back and forth, they indicate more work needs to be done to address trans rights. ""Nobody wins when politicians try to meddle in people's lives like this. Nobody wins when we try to codify discrimination like this. We're thrilled with the decision by South Dakota lawmakers to kill this bill,"" said Jett Jonelis, an ACLU of South Dakota advocacy manager in a statement following the termination of HB-1217 earlier this week. Following Noem's announced executive orders, Jonelis pushed back on the governor's notion of protecting ""fairness in women's sports"" in a statement to ABC News. ""If Gov. Noem really wanted to protect fairness in women's sports, she would tackle the actual   such as severe underfunding, lack of media coverage, sexist ideologies that suggest that women and girls are weak, and  ,"" Jonelis said. For now, it appears that at least one factor in the legislative saga could offer room for common ground -- according to Jonelis, the South Dakota ACLU is also currently examining whether the governor ""exceeded her authority by issuing these executive orders."""
Why Sen. Duckworth reached a 'trigger point' with White House over AAPI representation,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sen-duckworth-reached-trigger-point-white-house-aapi/story?id=76788302,"After reaching a ""trigger point"" with the White House over Asian American and Pacific Islander representation in the Cabinet, Illinois Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth is ""very pleased"" with the response  She told ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl and Political Director Rick Klein that the ""trigger point"" that caused her to threaten to block Biden's nominees was a White House representative bringing up Vice President Kamala Harris to convince her the Cabinet was diverse enough. ""I said 'whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, wait a minute, I love Kamala she's my sister,'"" she said. ""'She's brilliant, and she and I came into the Senate together. And she is as Asian as I am, we're both half Asian. But you would never say to the Black Caucus, you have Kamala, there's no need to nominate any more members of the Black community to key Cabinet positions. I mean, you wouldn't even say, hey, you've got a white male president, there's no need to have any more white males in the Cabinet -- right? So why would you say that to Asians?'"" ""I think that is illustrative of the otherness (in how) AAPI's have been treated in this country,"" she added. ""And I do talk about that in the book where I say, you know, you're always sort of like the other. You're always having to prove that you're American enough, that you're part of this country."" The Illinois senator's new memoir, ""Every Day is a Gift,"" came out March 30. The book shares stories from her life including her recovery after an RPG shot down her helicopter in Iraq and took both of her legs. She also discusses her experiences as a senator, including ""Babygate,"" when she fought to bring her newborn onto the floor of the Senate, and her experience as an Asian American woman in America. Duckworth raised the issue of diversity in Biden's Cabinet following an increase   since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. ""And I will tell you that the White House heard me,"" she said. ""They responded within 24 hours, and they said 'absolutely, and we're starting by putting a very senior staffer in the West Wing who will have the ability to say to the president or have the ability to say to his key advisers, 'wait a minute, you've overlooked this,' and that person will be of AAPI descent.'"" Duckworth also discussed President Joe Biden's  n on ""Powerhouse Politics."" The proposal, which is expected to cost $2 trillion, includes funding for modernizing transportation infrastructure, eliminating lead pipes and expanding broadband access. ""This is one of those once-in-a-lifetime efforts that is going to really bring America back to the status of a global leader economically and creates just so many jobs in this country that are so badly needed right now,"" she said. Duckworth said parts of the plan will pay for themselves, like fixing leaking water pipelines. She added that the plan could be paid for through increasing the gas tax, although a gas tax increase is not in Biden's proposal. ""It was actually the trucking industry that came to us and said 'we're spending more money stuck in road congestion and fixing and repairing our trucks because of the bad quality of the streets in this country,'"" Duckworth said. ""'We would rather raise the gas tax, and pay that because that will save us money in the long run.'"" When Karl pressed Duckworth on the gas tax, noting that it would impact all Americans, including those with low incomes, she pointed to tax credits as a way of alleviating that pain. ""I don't have a problem with going and revoking the tax cuts for the ultra-rich and for large corporations that the Republicans passed just a few years ago. That will not affect working families in this country,"" Duckworth said. ""So there are ways to do this. I'm happy to be bipartisan about it, but the key thing here is that if we don't do this, it's going to cost us more in the long run, in terms of losses to businesses, in terms of where the country will be, in terms of not having the jobs that we need."" Duckworth also shared her experience during the Jan. 6 insurrection and connected it to the title of her book, which she called ""a love letter to America."" ""Betrayal is the best that I can describe how I felt and how I still feel today,"" she said. ""But after all that, this democracy, this country, despite all of our divides and what happened then, is still worth it. We are-- it's still worth working towards that more perfect union."""
"Delta, Coca-Cola forcefully condemn Georgia elections bill as activists ramp up pressure on corporations",politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/delta-now-opposes-georgias-elections-bill-activists-ramp/story?id=76789220,"Facing mounting pressure, Delta Air Lines' and Coca-Cola's chief executives came out forcefully against    s bill Wednesday, both calling it ""unacceptable"" -- a stark difference from the companies' previous, more muted statements. ""After having time to now fully understand all that is in the bill, coupled with discussions with leaders and employees in the Black community, it's evident that the bill includes provisions that will make it harder for many underrepresented voters, particularly Black voters, to exercise their constitutional right to elect their representatives. That is wrong,"" CEO Ed Bastian said in a memo sent to all Delta employees worldwide. His   praised aspects of the new law, and said it ""improved considerably during the legislative process."" Hours later, Coca-Cola's CEO joined Delta's in condemning the legislation, calling it a ""step backwards"" in an interview with CNBC. ""This legislation is wrong and needs to be remedied, and we will continue to advocate for it, both in private and now even more clearly in public,"" Quincy said. ""The reality is many things are improved and done and achieved in private without having to take a public stand, but in this case, it does not work, clearly, and so we're being more forceful in our public position."" Quincy's rebuke went much further than another top Coca-Cola executive's did in a   Monday. Coca-Cola did not take a public stance on the bill before it passed, but Monday's statement said the company was ""disappointed in the outcome."" Since Gov. Brian Kemp signed the Republican-sponsored   into law Thursday evening, voting rights activists from a broad coalition of more than 50 groups have ramped up their   Georgia-based businesses. Some leaders are even calling for boycotts. LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter -- one of the coalition groups leading on this issue -- told ABC News Wednesday she was glad that Delta and Coca-Cola changed their stance, and while she said the work is harder now because the bill has passed, she believes these corporations have the ""political muscle"" to make a difference not just in Georgia, but nationwide. ""I'm hoping that they really do recognize ... that not coming out earlier was a missed opportunity, but that in fact they have an opportunity now,"" Brown said. ""(They can) send a clear message that as a company, they adamantly stand against the bills in Georgia and all bills that seek to suppress the vote, and that they're going to use their political capital and leverage to actually prevent voter suppression and stand for democracy."" Delta and Coca-Cola's repositioning also comes as 72 Black executives penned an open letter, which ran as a full-page ad in Wednesday's  , calling on corporate America  to stand in public opposition to any legislation that would restrict voting access, and specifically, Black voters' access to the ballot. ""Make no mistake, we have seen this playbook before,"" the letter read. ""As Black business leaders, we cannot sit silently in the face of this gathering threat to our nation's democratic values and allow the fundamental right of Americans, to cast their votes for whomever they choose, to be trampled upon yet again."" Before the Georgia bill passed, activists had called on major corporations based in the Peach State to publicly oppose the omnibus elections bills being considered by the General Assembly, which they said was directly aimed at suppressing Black voters and other historically disenfranchised communities. But most corporations did not, instead opting to issue general statements supporting fair, accessible and secure elections. Delta and Coca-Cola received much of the post-signing blowback. Wednesday morning, before the executives articulated clearer positions against the bill, Hannah Gebresilassie, a co-founder of #ProtectTheVoteGA, told ABC News that both companies' ""watered-down statements"" were ""extremely disappointing."" ""We expect them to stand up for people across this nation, when injustices are facing our lives,"" Gebresilassie said. ""We want to see Coca-Cola and Delta put their money where their mouth is. Y'all better be helping pay for voter mobilization efforts in the next few months because we have a lot of educating to do with this bill being passed."" On Wednesday afternoon, a group of voters, Black church leaders and activists from Black Voters Matter, the New Georgia Project Action Fund and #ProtectTheVoteGA held a rally in front of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, whose president and CEO   of support for several provisions of the bill, but recognized that ""concerns remain."" Despite the rain, the demonstrators showed up to demand accountability from business leaders on the issue of voting rights. Attendees handed out water to people walking in and out of the building, which under the new elections law volunteers can no longer do for voters waiting in sometimes hours-long lines. Other provisions in the bill that activists have blasted include a shortened early voting period for runoffs, a ban on out-of-precinct voting until 5 p.m., limitations on ballot drop box accessibility and the new ability for voters to make an unlimited number of challenges to other voters' eligibility. Some of the same Georgia corporations being targeted over the elections law responded stood united with the Black Lives Matter movement in the summer of 2020, when activists and allies protested against racial injustice following George Floyd's death in police custody. Both Coca-Cola and Delta came out in support of that racial reckoning. A ""Black Lives Matter""   at Delta's headquarters. Coca-Cola made a racial equity commitment plan, and a   is still on the company's Twitter account. ""They need to understand how strong the correlation is, right? If you're saying Black lives matter, you also need to say that Black votes matter,"" Crystal Greer, the other co-founder of #ProtectTheVoteGA, told ABC News. Brown said companies joining the movement that followed Floyd's death was a ""positive move forward,"" but she said now, companies who did so need to make clear that it was not a ""marketing exploitation opportunity."" ""It is one thing to in the heat of the moment, to say that I stand and I acknowledge this is wrong (but) I think it also has to be more than transactional. It has to be a transformative change,"" Brown said. ""What are their values as companies around racial justice and racial equity? What are they willing to give, but what are they willing to give up?"""
Democrat Rita Hart ends election challenge in close Iowa House race,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrat-rita-hart-ends-election-challenge-close-iowa/story?id=76796759,"Democrat Rita Hart announced she's withdrawing her challenge to the results in Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, ending a   over the last contest of the 2020  . Hart dropped her petition before the House panel tasked with overseeing the review, according to a statement released Wednesday, amid intense pressure from both sides. ""After many conversations with people I trust about the future of this contest, I have made the decision to withdraw my contest before the House Committee on Administration,"" she said, citing ""the toxic campaign of political disinformation to attack this constitutional review of the closest congressional contest in 100 years."" ""It is a stain on our democracy that the truth has not prevailed and my hope for the future is a return to decency and civility,"" she added. GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks was   in November by a mere six votes out of 400,000 cast, marking one of the closest House races in modern history. She was seated with the rest of Congress in early January, taking the oath of office and representing the southeastern Iowa district despite Hart moving forward with a petition in the House. Hart asked the House panel in December to probe the results after a recount and certification, bypassing the courts and calling for a hand recount of all votes -- including 22 ballots that were excluded from the official tally. Her legal team centered their case on those excluded ballots, saying that they were legally cast and should be counted and would ultimately hand her a victory if they were included. ""Since Election Day, and throughout this entire process, my mission has been about ensuring the voices of Iowans who followed the law are not silenced. I am saddened that some Iowans’ votes will not count through no fault of their own. The work of ensuring it does not happen again will continue beyond this campaign,"" Hart said in the statement ending her challenge. But a pursuit in Congress was a politically fraught maneuver, with Republicans mounting a pressure campaign against Democrats for trying to reverse the election outcome and framing the challenge as an attempt by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi try to ""steal"" a Republican seat and pad her slim majority. ""The race is over. I understand people get upset when they lose, but the idea that you want to come in and play a political game is concerning to me,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said at a press conference in Iowa, just hours before Hart's announcement. ""We have elections and people need to have trust and faith and confidence in their elections,"" Miller-Meeks said earlier on Wednesday alongside McCarthy. ""If six votes aren't enough to win an election, then why are six members on a committee able to overturn an election."" After Hart officially dropped her challenge, McCarthy celebrated Miller-Meeks' victory, saying in a statement, ""Rita Hart and Nancy Pelosi finally heard what many Iowans told me today: Mariannette Miller-Meeks is the duly-elected Congresswoman serving Iowa’s Second Congressional District."" The GOP's efforts to cast Democrats as trying to invalidate certified election results comes after spending months supporting former President Donald Trump's attempt to reverse his electoral defeat last year. McCarthy voted alongside 138 House Republicans against certifying the presidential results from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Democrats, including Pelosi, pushed back by drawing a contrast between Hart's challenge -- which followed a legal process outlined by federal law and focused on 22 ballots to back up their claims -- and Trump's fruitless effort based on unsubstantiated allegations of fraud. Throughout the protracted process, one of the most significant wrinkles for Democrats was within their own ranks, as some moderate members balked at the prospect of overturning the election results if a vote came to the House floor. ""Losing a House election by six votes is painful for Democrats. But overturning it in the House would be even more painful for America. Just because a majority can, does not mean a majority should,"" Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn.,   earlier this month. It's not unusual for an election to be contested before the obscure committee: there have been 110 cases filed since 1933. But overturning an election is a rare outcome: over nearly 90 years, only three of those cases resulted in the declared winner being removed and replaced, according to the committee, and in one, the seat was left vacant. New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of House Democrats' campaign arm who is charged with defending Democrats' majority in next year's midterm elections, said in a statement after Hart's announcement that he respects the former Iowa state senator's decision and pledged that Democrats will continue to fight for voters. ""From the day she announced her candidacy, Rita Hart has shown that she is a tireless advocate for the people of Iowa. I respect her decision and applaud her efforts to ensure that every legal vote was counted in this election. I know her service and commitment to Iowans won't end here,"" Maloney said. ""While Republicans have been throwing up roadblocks to the ballot box at every turn, Democrats will always fight to ensure every American can vote and that every legal vote is counted."""
"With older Americans largely vaccinated, more new COVID-19 cases among younger adults",politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/older-americans-largely-vaccinated-covid-19-cases-younger/story?id=76777363,"As more older Americans get vaccinated an increasing number of new   cases are impacting younger adults,   that   in an effort to prevent more people from becoming sick. The number of new COVID-19 cases increased more than 10% in 26 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico since last week, a possible signal that the country is on the  . And for the first time, the majority of new hospitalizations have been younger adults, with cases among people ages 50-65 increasing more than those older than 65, who are more likely to have been vaccinated. And in some states, like Michigan and Massachusetts, the number of cases among older children, teenagers and young adults have also increased. At the same time recent data showed a 96% decline in COVID-19 cases in nursing homes since the vaccine rollout began in December, indicating high vaccination rates are helping protect older populations. Dr. Nick Gilpin, chief medical officer for Beaumont Health system in Michigan, said the average age of their COVID-19 patients is 46 years old. ""A lot of these individuals have been doing all of those things that we’ve been warning about: gathering together in large groups, going to bars and restaurants,"" he told ABC News. Public   experts say a more serious spike in cases can still be prevented, but only if everyone doubles down on protections like wearing masks, avoiding indoor gatherings, refraining from nonessential travel and getting vaccinated as soon as possible. ""I so badly want to be done. I know you all so badly want to be done. We are just almost there, but not quite yet,"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said in  Walensky and other public health officials said cases are increasing because people began to relax their behavior while there was still a lot of the virus spreading in the country, particularly newer variants that can spread more easily. As more states have relaxed restrictions and more people have been traveling, the virus has taken advantage of more opportunities to spread. ""The rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 cases in teens and young adults is very troubling. Tragically, states -- like Massachusetts -- ignored the advice of public health officials and re-opened too quickly,"" said Sam Scarpino, an assistant professor in the emerging epidemics lab at Northeastern University. ""As a result we're at risk, entering another surge and delaying our safe return to normalcy,"" Scarpino added. Twenty-six states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have seen an increase of over 10% in the number of new cases since last week. New Jersey, New York, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Connecticut currently hold the highest case rates per 100,000 people over the last seven days. Hospital admissions are also increasing in nearly a dozen states. As more states push to reopen schools and businesses the increased activity also creates more opportunities for the virus to spread among younger groups that have thus far not been seen as at high risk for severe illness. ""Not many states make age data available over time, but in the few that do, older children -- 10-19 -- and young adults are making up a larger fraction of the cases. This likely reflects a combination of widespread vaccination among older adults and increased mobility among young people, through school reopening and more community activities,"" said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Rivers said a new surge among younger adults wouldn't necessarily lead to increases in hospitalizations and deaths like the trend with  . ""Through most of the pandemic, hospitalizations and deaths have tracked closely with cases. But now that nearly three in four people over the age of 65 have had at least one dose of the vaccine, we’ll start to see that change. I expect that even in places where cases surge, we won’t see as many severe cases as we would have six months ago,"" she said. But Walensky and other public health officials said even if a ""fourth surge"" in cases affects more younger adults, they're still concerned about any increase in how much the virus is spreading. ""There are plenty of reasons to not want to have COVID outside of just the deaths alone,"" Walensky said in an interview on MSNBC on Monday night. ""We know that about 10% of the population that gets sick with COVID has long haul syndrome, has symptoms beyond three weeks, cardiac challenges, depression and mental health challenges, pulmonary challenges, renal failure, clotting. So there's a lot we don't understand about this disease, and we shouldn't want to have it circulating whether or not it leads to mortality,"" she continued."
"Biden unveils sweeping infrastructure plan, calling it a 'once-in-a-generation investment in America'",politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bidens-big-push-massive-infrastructure-plan-proposed-tax/story?id=76770525,"President   on Wednesday unveiled what he has called his  , a roughly $2 trillion   plan to modernize thousands of miles of roads, fix thousands of bridges, expand broadband access and replace all lead pipes carrying drinking water. ""It's not a plan that tinkers around the edges,"" Biden said in a speech in Pittsburgh. ""It's a once-in-a-generation investment in America, unlike anything we've seen or done since we built the interstate highway system and the space race decades ago. In fact, it's the largest American jobs investment since World War II."" To pay for it, he is proposing trillions of dollars in   on corporations -- making a traditionally bipartisan issue one expected to trigger Republican opposition. He said he would invite Republicans to the Oval Office and ""listen to them"" and their ideas about how to pay for his proposals. The president also faces headwinds from progressive Democrats who do not think the spending package is large enough, as well as more centrist Democrats who feel the opposite. Balancing their competing interests will prove essential as the Democratic leadership pushes a bill through a Congress it only very narrowly controls. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told colleagues Monday she hopes to pass it by July 4, if not later that month, according to a person familiar with her comments. ""I'm convinced that if we act now, in 50 years, people are going to look back and say, 'This was the moment that America won the future,'"" Biden said Wednesday, decrying the state of U.S. infrastructure compared to other countries. ""What I'm proposing is a one-time capital investment of roughly $2 trillion in America's future, spread largely over eight years. It will generate historic job growth, historic economic growth, help businesses to compete internationally and create more revenue as well."" Biden's spending plan, he said, will create millions of jobs. He detailed the first part during a speech in industry- and union-centric Pittsburgh, where he also kicked off his campaign in 2019, pledging to restore the middle class. ""Two years ago, I began my campaign here in Pittsburgh, saying I was running to 'rebuild the backbone of America,'"" Biden said, calling himself a ""union guy."" ""And today, I return as your president to lay out the vision of how I believe we do that."" The president proposed pairing the decade's worth of spending with a series of tax hikes on corporations, which the White House said will pay the full infrastructure costs over 15 years. Biden proposes raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, a return to the level before the 2017 GOP rewrite of the tax code. His plan would also increase taxes on multinational companies' profits abroad and would eliminate subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, among other ideas. On a call with reporters Tuesday night, an administration official wouldn't say if Biden plans to send one entire package or separate proposals to Congress. The official also wouldn't say when any of the proposed infrastructure projects could potentially get started. When asked how many jobs the proposal -- which is being called the ""American Jobs Plan"" -- would create, the official would not provide a specific number, only saying it would ""create millions and millions of jobs."" Biden said he planned to roll out a second component of his proposal later in April, which press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday would center on ""creating economic security for the middle class through investments in child care, health care, education and other areas."" That part could total more than $1 trillion in additional spending, according to people familiar with a Tuesday briefing for top senators on congressional committees who will be involved in crafting the package. In recent months, Biden has signaled that he would pay for future spending proposals by raising taxes not just on corporations but on wealthy individuals, too. Biden had previously said that Americans making over $400,000 per year would see their taxes increase and that he supported taxing capital gains as normal income, which are not among the ideas the White House proposed this week. An administration official told ABC News that ""the focus of this plan is on corporate tax reform,"" and Biden reiterated Wednesday that those making less than $400,000 annually would not see an increase. ""No one, let me say it again, no one making under $400,000 will see their federal taxes go up, period,"" he said. ""This is not about penalizing anyone. I have nothing against millionaires and billionaires. I believe American -- in American capitalism."" It's possible that those tax proposals could appear alongside next month's spending proposal. The package is separated into four areas: transportation, home, care and research-and-development infrastructure. Among the proposals is $621 billion in updates to modernize roads, rails, ports, airports, mass transit and highways; $100 billion to eliminate 100% of lead pipes; $100 billion to build out high-speed broadband across the country; $400 billion for community-based care for elderly Americans and a $180 billion investment in clean energy. It also includes $174 billion to spur job growth in the electric-vehicle market and create a national network of 500,000 electric-vehicle chargers by 2030. ""They are among the highest-valued investments that we can make in the nation,"" Biden said, arguing they would improve the country's competitiveness. He invoked the space program more than once, noting nearly 2,000 impactful products and services it generated and implored Americans ""to imagine again"" ""The rest of the world is closing in, and closing in fast,"" Biden said. ""We can't allow this to continue. An American Jobs Plan is the biggest increase in our federal, non-defense research and development spending on record."" As president-elect, Biden laid out ""a two-step plan of rescue and recovery"" -- the first, his   relief proposal, a version of which became law this month, and the second, what he called his ""Build Back Better"" plan. That plan, he said in January, ""will make historic investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, innovation, research and development, and clean energy. Investments in the caregiving economy and in skills and training needed by our workers to compete and win the global economy of the future."" Biden has prioritized the major spending plan, the first half of his package, as he seizes on any early momentum after pushing the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package through Congress. But with a razor-thin Democratic majority in the House -- he can only afford to lose eight Democratic votes -- and an evenly split Senate, it remains to be seen whether the infrastructure package could pass through Congress. While improving airports and roads typically find bipartisan support, the Biden administration's plans to fund improvements through tax increases could turn off most, if not all, Republicans, and potentially even some Democrats. The coronavirus relief package was popular among Americans, including Republicans, but it did not garner a   in Congress. As it did with the relief package, the White House has similarly leaned into popular support for infrastructure improvements -- a sign it is prepared to use, and will try to shape, public opinion as a cudgel to bring lawmakers on board. Another threat came this week from several New York-area House Democrats who want to see Biden lift the cap on the deduction for state-and-local taxes, known as SALT, imposed by a law then-President Donald Trump signed in 2017. Doing so would benefit suburban homeowners, although some progressive Democrats could balk at the notion of a tax change that would benefit relatively wealthier Americans. ""If SALT is not included, I'm not voting for any changes to the tax code,"" Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., told ABC News this week. ""We all put our different interests about different issues on the back burner for the American Rescue Plan because it was so important that we all come together on it."" On Tuesday, Suozzi issued a statement with two other Democrats, Reps. Bill Pascrell and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, opposing any deal that does not reverse the cap on the SALT deduction. ""We say, 'No SALT, no deal,'"" they said. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, too, on Wednesday said he would ""fight hard"" to get the SALT deduction caps lifted, although the New Yorker backed Biden's infrastructure plan and touted the jobs the White House said it would create. Biden's plan does not reverse the cap on SALT deduction. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told reporters on Tuesday that the group would not take a position on lifting the cap, but added, ""I'm not sure that our members will see it as some of the fundamental reforms to the tax system that would make the system more fair."" The White House has indicated that Biden would be willing to negotiate on potential new taxes that are sure to be unpalatable to Republicans and Democrats alike. ""The president has a plan to fix our infrastructure and a plan to pay for it,"" Psaki said Monday. ""But we are also open to having that discussion, and we certainly expect to have the discussion with members of Congress, as we move forward, about areas where they agree, where they disagree, where they would like to see greater emphasis or not."" Biden has said he wants to attempt to pass a major infrastructure package as his second priority -- before legislation on immigration or gun reform, for example -- because he thinks the current, divisive political climate may be more tolerant of a spending plan could help the United States ""compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs."" ""It's a matter of timing,""   last week. But if Republican support does not materialize this time either, Schumer's office this week hinted at the possibility Democrats in that chamber could try to push through the president's proposals through a budgetary process known as ""reconciliation"" -- the same way they passed Biden's COVID-19 relief bill. That process would allow for a simple majority -- including Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote -- to pass Biden's bills, unlike the 60 votes normally needed. But that step would require the support of all 50 Senate Democrats -- far from guaranteed after centrists have expressed a desire for prioritizing bipartisanship this time around. Asked on Tuesday night's call if the White House hopes to use reconciliation to push the package through, an administration official would only say, ""this is the beginning of a process"" and would be reaching out to Republicans and Democrats. Biden could also face competing pressures inside his party on the overall size of the package, with Jayapal and other progressives encouraging the White House to think bigger. ""The Biden proposal on the campaign trail was significantly larger than what's been discussed so far,"" Jayapal said. ""We really think there's ample room to get the overall number up to somewhere in that range (of $6.5 trillion and $11 trillion over the next 10 years) in order to really tackle the scale of investment that we need to make."""
"In investigation of Rep. Gaetz's alleged sexual relationship with minor, feds looking beyond Florida, sources say",politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/feds-florida-investigation-rep-gaetz-sources/story?id=76796794,"The federal investigation into Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz is focused on allegations that the junior congressman had a sexual relationship with at least one minor, and is scrutinizing the Republican's conduct not only in Florida but outside the politician's home state too, three sources familiar with the investigation tell ABC News. The investigation, first reported by the New York Times Tuesday and  , has sent shockwaves through Republican circles, particularly among close associates of former President  , who considered Gaetz a staunch ally and loyal friend. ""I have not had a relationship with a 17-year-old. That is totally false,"" Gaetz told Fox News' Tucker Carlson in an interview Tuesday night. ""That is false and records will bear that out to be false."" Sources told ABC News the investigation has been going on for months and began during the Trump administration. Former Attorney General Bill Barr was briefed on the investigation's progress several times, the sources said. One source told ABC News that federal authorities have already interviewed multiple witnesses as part of their probe. Gaetz has reportedly told confidants he is considering retiring from Congress and possibly joining the right-wing media outlet Newsmax, according to   earlier Tuesday. Yet within the last several weeks Gaetz started reaching out to prominent attorneys, according to one source. The source said that one of the attorneys Gaetz asked to represent him was Washington attorney Bill Burck, who represented Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus and Don McGahn during the Mueller probe. Burck turned down the case, according to a person familiar with the decision. On Fox News Tuesday night, Gaetz appeared to confirm the investigation when he said he was approached by someone who claimed he could ""make this investigation go away."" ""There was a demand for money in exchange for a commitment that he could make this investigation go away along with his co-conspirators,"" Gaetz said, identifying the alleged extortionist as former DOJ official David McGee. The law offices of Beggs & Lane, where McGee is now employed as a private attorney, denied those allegations in a statement Wednesday night. ""The allegation by the Congressman is both false and defamatory,"" the statement read. ""Mr. McGee was the Chief Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida 25 years ago. During his tenure with the Department of Justice his reputation for integrity and ethical conduct was impeccable. It has remained impeccable throughout his 25 year tenure with our firm. While he was with the DOJ he would never have entertained a scheme such as what Congressman Gaetz suggests nor would he today. Unsubstantiated allegations do not change that fact."" One source familiar with the matter confirmed that the FBI and Justice Department are separately investigating Gaetz's allegations that he was the target of an extortion attempt."
Army awards Microsoft $22 billion contract for futuristic goggles ,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/army-awards-microsoft-22-billion-contract-futuristic-goggles/story?id=76798519,"The Army has awarded   a contract that could be worth almost $22 billion for   that give soldiers a new way to see the battlefield. Known as IVAS, the acronym for the Integrated Visual Augmentation System, the goggles project 3D terrain maps over what soldiers see directly in front of them and allows troops to see in the dark, through smoke and even around corners. Based on Microsoft's HoloLens 2, the augmented reality goggles were ruggedized for the wear and tear of combat and have undergone prototype testing over the past two years. On Wednesday, the Army announced that it had awarded a 10-year production contract to Microsoft for the IVAS system potentially worth $21.88 billion. The contract has a five-year base period followed by another five-year option, said Courtney Bacon, an Army spokesperson. Microsoft said that the contract could provide more than 120,000 goggles to the Close Combat Force. ""We appreciate the partnership with the U.S. Army, and are thankful for their continued trust in transitioning IVAS from rapid prototyping to rapid fielding,"" wrote Microsoft's Alex Kipman in a   post. Kipman designed Holo Lens and has led the research and development of the goggle's conversion into IVAS for the Army. Last fall, Kipman told ABC News that the goggle system provides soldiers with a significant upgrade in situational awareness. The system gives soldiers more information than they have ever had on the battlefield. ""The IVAS aggregates multiple technologies into an architecture that allows the Soldier to Fight, Rehearse, and Train using a single platform,"" said an Army statement   the production contract. Attached to combat helmets, the clear goggles allow soldiers to know precisely where they are thanks to a heads-up display, or HUD, that provides them with an overhead compass and overlays maps of their location. Holograms and 3D terrain maps are projected onto the goggles to see what lies ahead and lets soldiers know precisely where their squad mates are on the battlefield. The goggles also incorporate significant improvements in night vision and thermal imagery technologies that give soldiers a full 180-degree field of view. An attachment mounted on a rifle barrel projects onto the HUD whatever could be seen through the rifle scope, regardless of what direction a soldier is looking. That capability gives troops an edge in dangerous urban warfare by letting them peer around corners. The high-tech goggles will be made available to all of the Army's combat infantry troops, bringing them resources that may have once been only available to elite units. Eric Oehlerich, a retired Navy SEAL and ABC News contributor, sees that as a step toward improving the combat effectiveness of all American troops on the battlefield. ""The more situational awareness you have about your forces, and the enemy position, the easier it is to dominate the fight,"" he added. ""Investments in equipment like the IVAS goggles will greatly increase the awareness each service member will have during the 'fog of war,' making them more lethal when called upon."" Mick Mulroy, a retired Marine and ABC News contributor, agreed with Oehlerich, but also stressed that basic military skills will need to be maintained. ""It is also important that we don't become over reliant on technology,"" said Mulroy. ""We need to train with it and without it, as our adversaries will no doubt try and counter our technological improvements."" The deal is the second major contract won by the tech giant in recent years. Last year, the Pentagon selected Microsoft over Amazon to take over its $10 billion JEDI cloud project. While the IVAS contract is twice as large as the JEDI project, it could end up being less if the Army decides not to pursue its five-year option."
"As states open up eligibility, the 1st big test of America's vaccine hesitancy",politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/states-open-eligibility-1st-big-test-americas-vaccine/story?id=76768464,"As the majority of adults in the country now sit on the cusp of eligibility for the    , the U.S. is shifting into the first real-world test of   of the inoculations. Up until the last few weeks,   only Americans with the highest   from the virus and the biggest incentive to protect themselves, were eligible. But by late April, as vaccine supply ramps up, all adults -- not just those with the most reason to fear the virus --   and get their shot. So, will they? ""This is when the real work begins,"" said Dr. Timothy Callaghan, a   politics professor at Texas A&M University who studies vaccine hesitancy. Callaghan said public health experts have been   particular fight for months, even before earlier vaccine issues were smoothed over. ""We weren't worried about the supply issues that we were seeing early in the vaccine delivery process,"" Callaghan said. ""We were concerned about what was going to start to happen from April through July, as states start to realize we have the vaccines, but don't have people to take them."" Now, on the heels of President Joe Biden's announcement that   to all adults by April 19, the time has come. The U.S. is administering nearly 3 million shots per day and, by May, drugmakers are expected to deliver enough vaccines to vaccinate 300 million Americans. Meanwhile, about six in 10 Americans reported already getting a vaccine or intending to get one -- a number that has increased -- with 17% who said they're taking a ""wait and see"" approach, according to March polling from the  . Remaining about the same since December are the 13% who said they will ""definitely not"" get the vaccine. With the floodgates open to mass vaccination, the spring and summer months should provide a clearer view of how much work needs to be done to vaccinate as many Americans as possible, Callaghan said. Among the first states to widen eligibility were Alaska, Mississippi, Texas, West Virginia, Ohio and Utah. As of Thursday, 19 states total had opened their eligibility to all adults 16 and older, and another 27 states plus Washington, D.C., had announced plans to do so. Some rural and Republican states have already seen signs of early hesitancy that allowed them, in part, to open their vaccination rollout up to the broader population earlier than any other states. Polling has shown people living in red, rural states report more vaccine hesitancy. In Ohio, the governor said they've seen less interest in vaccine registration as they open it up to younger populations. ""We seem to be having a slower uptake every time we move down in age,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said at a press briefing just before the state opened eligibility to all adults on March 29. ""But, I mean, the interesting thing is even in the older groups, you continue still to see those numbers go up,"" he said, noting that the number of vaccinated people in their 80s is continuing to rise. DeWine openly acknowledged that he was concerned about vaccine hesitancy getting in the way of herd immunity for the state, though. ""Frankly, a lot is gonna depend on our young people's willingness to take this vaccine and to slow the spread down,"" DeWine said. And in West Virginia, the state's   response coordinator, Clay Marsh, said they were surprised that as many people are getting vaccinated as they are. The state widely opened eligibility on March 22. ""We did anticipate having a lot more vaccine hesitancy,"" Marsh said, noting that people from rural and Republican areas of the country are more hesitant than those from urban and Democrat areas. ""Well, we're pretty rural and we're pretty Republican,"" Marsh continued. And while they've seen pockets of hesitancy, Marsh said, the state has been pleased that 70% of people in the 65+ age group have gotten vaccines. In December, state data showed that around 45% of the state was either less willing or strongly unwilling to get a vaccine. In Mississippi, one local doctor suggested people are waiting for the vaccine to appear at their physician's office before they get the shot. The state opened up eligibility to all adults two weeks ago and continues to have thousands of open appointments. ""It's not so much hesitancy as it is access for most of our patients,"" said Dr. Laura Miller, a family physician who mostly treats patients from rural, minority communities in Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi. Because   of all the vaccines in Mississippi have been offered at drive-thru mass vaccination clinics and other state-run sites, Miller sees a lot of patients who want to or need to wait until they can get the vaccine closer to home, in a more familiar setting. ""I have patients here that want to get their shot, they just don't have a means to get there or don't want to until I can do it,"" Miller said. There's also ""some hesitancy, and there's some straight refusal,"" she added. Still, Miller predicted that when there's enough vaccine supply to get doses out to individual clinics and pharmacies, ""we'll have some fairly steady uptake."" On Monday, Biden said that by April 19, 90% of Americans will live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. Taken all together, even among states that share population demographics and politics, there's still not a sole factor that can predict vaccine hesitancy. Jeff Zients, Biden's coronavirus response coordinator, told reporters at a briefing last week that he wasn't concerned about states that were opening their eligibility up to all adults well in advance of the May 1 deadline. ""If there are states that are lagging behind, we're working with those states to ensure that they continue to prioritize the most vulnerable populations. That said, with the increase in demand, we think it's a good thing that states are opening up eligibility to all Americans no later than May 1st,"" Zients said Friday. But while there will be people who want the vaccine and people who don't, states will also have to do more than just open up eligibility to achieve herd immunity. They will have to improve systems making it harder for people to get the vaccine, compounding hesitancy that already exists. Long drives to unfamiliar towns or cities where vaccines are being distributed, clunky registration websites, long hold times on the phone and lack of outreach can all give the impression of ""vaccine hesitancy,"" when in reality, community members are willing to get the vaccine but face logistical hurdles, which are often worse in poorer communities. Experts have also warned that opening up eligibility widely could allow people with easier access to transportation and technology to leap over less advantaged people for appointments. ""That is a potential red flag and something to be aware of,"" Callaghan said. ""To try and work against that, states need to be paying attention to populations they are vaccinating on a daily and weekly basis to say 'okay, we're not getting enough people from this at-risk community or that at-risk community, so maybe we need to set aside some appointments for those groups to make sure that they are still getting vaccinated.'"" There will also be unpredictable benefits to widely opening up eligibility, like the power of peer pressure. As more people get the vaccine, they'll share how they got it and what it felt like with their friends and family, increasing trust in the shot. But for the next several weeks, the effect will be unknown. ""You can't really say that hesitancy is the cause until you've given people a chance to vaccinate and then they choose not to,"" Callaghan said."
Matt Gaetz's controversial rise to MAGA stardom faces renewed scrutiny amid DOJ probe ,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/matt-gaetzs-controversial-rise-maga-stardom-faces-renewed/story?id=76799913,"In 2017, both chambers of Congress passed an anti-human-trafficking bill that provided more funds to protect vulnerable women. The vote was nearly unanimous, minus one lone holdout: Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz. Gaetz's vote at the time puzzled his new colleagues in Congress, and days later, he took to Facebook to defend it on a live stream from his parents' living room. ""I assure you it's not because I don't think human trafficking is a problem,"" he declared. ""It absolutely is. But far too often the best of intentions can lead to mission creep at the federal level."" The conservative rising star, who spent the past three years drawing the spotlight by cutting against the grain, now finds himself gaining attention he didn't seek. And again, the subject is human trafficking. Gaetz sits at the center of a   into potential violations of sex trafficking laws that involves an alleged sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl, multiple sources confirmed to ABC News. Gaetz turned immediately to the airwaves Tuesday to refute the allegations of a relationship with a minor, doing so in a Fox News interview with Tucker Carlson, who afterward called the segment ""one of the weirdest interviews I've ever conducted."" ""I have not had a relationship with a 17-year-old. That is totally false,"" Gaetz told Carlson. ""That is false and records will bear that out to be false."" Reports of the investigation into Gaetz, first published by the New York Times, have brought fresh   to the controversial young congressman. Elected to Congress in 2016 after serving in the Florida State Legislature, Gaetz is the scion of a powerful political family in his home state. His father Don served as president of the Florida Senate and has a reported net worth of more than $25 million, according to Florida financial disclosure reports. A frequent guest at   Mar-a-Lago resort, Gaetz, 38, emerged as a fierce defender of the former president who vocally backed Trump through two impeachment trials and repeated Trump's baseless claims of a stolen election in the midst of the attack on the Capitol, even taking to the House floor and falsely suggesting that antifa protesters were behind the riot. ""They were masquerading as Trump supporters,"" Gaetz said. The Florida congressman even traveled to Wyoming to headline a campaign rally targeting fellow Republican Liz Cheney after the congresswoman voted for the former president's second impeachment. Earlier, during Trump's first impeachment trial, Gaetz defended Trump by issuing a menacing tweet targeting Trump's former longtime lawyer Michael Cohen and his wife before Cohen testified before Congress. ""Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she'll remain faithful when you're in prison. She's about to learn a lot,"" Gaetz tweeted, which prompted the Florida Bar to open an investigation into the congressman's comments. Trump, in turn, has lavished praise over Gaetz at his boisterous rallies, calling him a ""great talent, young, handsome"" and saying that he's ""going places."" Trump also noted at a 2018 rally in Fort Myers, Florida, ""You talk about defending, he's fantastic."" So far, key figures in Trump's orbit, including Donald Trump Jr. and the former president himself, have yet to weigh in on the allegations against Gaetz. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a controversial figure herself, defended Gaetz on Twitter Wednesday, calling the investigation a ""witch hunt"" and adding, ""I stand with @mattgaetz."" Gaetz has broken from his party on occasion. In 2019, Gaetz was one of the few members to come to the defense of Democratic Rep. Katie Hill after the House Ethics Committee announced an investigation into allegations that Hill had an extramarital affair with an office staffer. ""This is just absurd. The only person who seems to have a gripe is @RepKatieHill's soon-to-be ex,"" Gaetz tweeted, adding, ""Who among us would look perfect if every ex leaked every photo/text?"" However, other interactions Gaetz has had with congresswomen have ignited controversy, including repeatedly commenting on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's appearance. Gaetz has called Ocasio-Cortez ""attractive"" multiple times, and in an interview with TMZ, he referenced the dating app Tinder by saying he would ""swipe right"" on the idea of working with her on cannabis legislation. In a Daily Caller segment from 2019 that centered around Gaetz's opinions regarding Ocasio-Cortez, the Florida congressman again commented on her looks, referring to his colleague as an ""attractive lady from Queens."" Later in 2020, when Gaetz revealed for the first time that he had raised a young man from Cuba as his son, the now-former Rep. Hill returned the favor and defended him publicly amid a surge of questions. ""Many of you know @mattgaetz & I have an unlikely friendship,"" Hill tweeted. ""I can't stand a lot of his beliefs but he's been there for me when others haven't. He talks about Nestor more than anything, has done so much for his son & is truly a proud dad."" Gaetz has repeatedly referred to 19-year-old Nestor Galban, the brother of one of Gaetz's ex-girlfriends, as his son -- but has suggested that he never formally adopted him. ""Our relationship as a family is defined by our love for each other, not by any paperwork,"" he told People magazine.

Corporate pressures suggest new dynamics on voting rights: The Note,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/corporate-pressures-suggest-dynamics-voting-rights-note/story?id=76793948,"It might look like it all came a week late.

His counterpart at Delta similarly called the law ""not acceptable,"" telling  : ""Our Black communities' voices need to be heard on this topic."" The revised corporate statements came on the same day that a coalition of Black business leaders, the Black Economic Alliance, ran an open-letter ad in The New York Times calling on corporate America to ""support our nation's fundamental democratic principles and marshal its collective influence."" It's too late for Georgia businesses to help rewrite their state's voting laws this year. But the Democratic Party of Georgia welcomed the statements, inviting the companies to join lobbying efforts for   pending on Capitol Hill.

Biden administration calls in grassroots leaders for COVID vaccine education campaign,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-administration-calls-grassroots-leaders-covid-vaccine-education/story?id=76810088,"The Biden administration has announced a new effort to   and dispel misinformation that will employ leaders from churches, unions and nonprofits. Vice President Kamala Harris, who held an inaugural meeting Thursday morning with the community leaders tapped for the new program, will supply up-to-date public   resources and open up a line of communication between 275 grassroots groups on the ground and the federal government. The administration is calling it the COVID-19 Community Corps. ""No matter the community, trusted leaders are the best way to boost confidence. And trusted leaders -- you -- are the best way to deliver information,"" Harris told the members of the COVID-19 Community Corps at a video conference on Thursday. The group of leaders represent communities where vaccine hesitancy or access to   remains a challenge. As Harris acknowledged Thursday, the U.S. has not rolled out its vaccine program equitably and has struggled to reach areas in rural America and among minority communities, where distrust in medicine and the government is part of the problem, but access to vaccines nearby and clunky registration systems have compounded the issue. ""In some communities -- some of our hardest-hit communities -- it's too hard to access the vaccine or get information about it. And we have to be honest about that. We certainly are,"" Harris said. ""We have to be honest that in some communities, there is a concern about getting vaccinated, some based on mistrust based on history, some based on -- just rooted in misinformation, of which there is a lot out there. And we need your help to combat that,"" Harris said. Hyepin Im, a member of the Corps and the founder and CEO of Faith and Community Empowerment, told the group she planned to connect her organization's 400,000 churches to the government's resources. She also spoke about the importance of getting the vaccine to Asian Americans, many of whom are doctors and nurses who everyday fight the virus -- and discrimination because of the virus. ""I just want to lift this up, use us, leverage us. We have the space, we have the volunteers, we have the heart and we have the trust,"" Im said at the conference. Dr. Reed Tuxon, a co-founder of the Black Coalition Against COVID, a group formed by doctors and nurses to fight the racial disparities in health care that the pandemic has exacerbated, said he had already seen the power of the group's work and was eager to push forward with support from the federal government. ""We can tell that the polling over the last several months has flipped from 70% negative in the Black community wanting to take the vaccine to now down to 28%. And we know that the people in the middle are definitely reachable,"" Tuxon said. ""We see April as the critical month in this flat out race to the finish line."" U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, also appearing remotely, told the group they would help save lives. ""Hearing the facts from trusted sources is what will help people make good decisions about their health,” Murthy said. “And that's why I firmly believe that your involvement will save lives.” The Department of Health and Human Services, which is running the education campaign, also will supply funding for the new outreach program. Last week, HHS announced nearly $10 billion will go toward increasing vaccine access in hard-hit vulnerable communities, including $3 billion in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funding to support outreach. The program's leaders will be aided by a social media campaign and bilingual ads, which HHS will air on TV throughout April."

"FDA authorizes rapid, non-prescription COVID-19 tests",politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fda-authorizes-rapid-prescription-covid-19-tests/story?id=76798644,"More Americans will soon be able to purchase over-the-counter rapid coronavirus tests without a prescription at their local pharmacy or retail store following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s authorization of two more at-home tests that are easy to buy and perform. The FDA on Thursday authorized BinaxNOW, a COVID-19 antigen self-test by Abbott, a U.S. COVID-19 testing manufacturing company. It also authorized the Quick Vue test by Quidel, a diagnostic health care product manufacturer. Neither requires a prescription. Abbott says its COVID-19 antigen self-test will be available to individuals with or without symptoms. ""Together with vaccines, the BinaxNOW self-test will help Americans get back to doing what they want and need to do -- like going to work and school or seeing friends and family -- with greater confidence,"" said Robert Ford, Abbott’s president and chief executive officer. Abbott’s rapid test initially required a health care provider to administer the swab and solution-based test kit, and then it was authorized for at-home use with a virtual proctor watching the process, which was included with the $25 fee. This new FDA authorization allows an individual to perform the test themselves, without a doctor’s prescription and at a lower cost. An Abbott spokesperson told ABC News the tests are expected to be sold in packs of two and will cost under $10 dollars per test. The spokesperson also said the test should be available in the coming weeks. Users will only need to perform a minimally invasive nasal swab, not the deeper nasal swaps common in some PCR tests and can expect results in about 15 minutes, accordiing to the company. Quidel's test is designed for self-collected nasal swabs for people 14 or older and for adult-collected specimens of children 2 years and up. Rapid antigen tests provide the advantage of lower costs, fewer supplies and speed than molecular PCR tests, which take one to two days for laboratory processing. PCR tests can detect lower levels of replicating virus, but antigen tests are intended to be accurate at detecting virus when a person is actively sick and most likely contagious.  of the accuracy of some rapid antigen tests and noted that they may be subject to false positive results – especially if there is not a lot of active virus in a specific community or if they are performed incorrectly. Proponents of rapid antigen tests point out the benefit of more people being able to identify when they are most contagious so they know to immediately isolate and not pass on the virus. Confirmation testing is still encouraged. ""The test performs at greater than 95% accuracy, and that’s the kind of level that we need to have the confidence to return to all the many things that we love to do,"" said Mary Rodgers, principal scientist at Abbott. ""We are prepared with our manufacturing to supply tens of million tests a month.""  said its test ""provides results in agreement with PCR 83.5% of the time when positive and 99.2% when negative."" The company did not indicate a timeline for the release of its tests. The influx of new tests comes as the nation faces a downward trend in the daily administration of COVID-19 tests, with health care workers now focused on distributing vaccine shots. The daily national COVID-19 testing rate is just over 1 million a day, according to  Public health experts argue that the low testing numbers are not where the nation needs to be to fully pull itself out of the pandemic, as the daily COVID-19 caseload creeps upward. ""The same people who are doing the testing are often the same ones doing the vaccinations,"" said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. ""And the attention to some of the issues around supply may affect the focus turning to vaccines rather than tests."" With just about 17% of Americans now fully vaccinated, coronavirus testing remains an important tool in tracking new cases and putting a halt to spread. The FDA in March issued additional guidance for test developers seeking emergency use authorization of tests screening large groups of individuals for COVID-19 infections. It is guidance that could come in handy for employers and school administrators looking for protection from bouts of coronavirus infection. ""With the FDA’s authorization of multiple tests, the public can be assured these tests have met our scientific standards for emergency use authorization,"" said Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. ""As we’ve said all along, if it’s a good test, we’ll authorize it."""
"ICE officers alleged to have used 'excessive' force, verbally abused detainees: Report ",politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ice-officers-alleged-excessive-force-verbally-abused-detainees/story?id=76814946,"An   and Customs Enforcement detention center in Eloy, Arizona, was in violation of multiple detention standards that put the health and safety of detainees at risk, according to a new federal watchdog report. The   includes allegations by detainees that officers at the La Palma Correctional Center used excessive force and findings that some verbally abused detainees. Officials fired pepper spray at detainees and deployed chemical agents from the ceiling in order to stop a peaceful protest by detainees in April 2020, according to the report. While detainees describe this use of force as ""excessive,"" the report states that federal detention guidelines may not have been violated since they don't specify how ICE officers should respond to civil disobedience. An ICE official said the report's claims about detention standards were ""unsubstantiated."" ""ICE leadership is concerned that several findings in the report rely on uncorroborated allegations by detainees, such as when it appears that the audit team did not interview ICE or the contracting facility representatives,"" the official wrote in a letter to the inspector general. In a separate incident, a guard ridiculed a detainee with ""profane and abusive language,"" according to the report. Another officer allegedly used a racial slur directed at a detainee, threatened to use pepper spray on him and terminated his phone call with family. The report also found that protocols to stem the spread of COVID-19 were not enforced at the facility and some detainees did not receive masks despite a coronavirus outbreak in August of last year. There have been 767 coronavirus cases at the facility and currently 75 detainees are being isolated or monitored, according to ICE data. Detainees also faced delays in receiving care and two detainees out of a sample of cases that were investigated, waited 12 and 14 days before receiving treatment for fever, the report found. The wide-ranging evaluation also included a review of the facility's medical unit, which investigators found to be ""critically understaffed."" Vacant positions in the mental health department were left unfilled for more than a year in some cases while the nursing department had 11 vacancies. In total, 21 of the 72 positions in the medical unit were unfilled at the time of the review, according to the report. ""The vacancies hinder the medical department's ability to provide care to the detained population,"" the report's authors wrote. In response to the staffing concerns raised by the watchdog report, facility managers pointed to the reduced population of the facility as the reason behind the vacancies. The average daily population of the facility at the time of the review was 1,542 while its maximum capacity is 2,340, which is why management said medical positions did not need to be fully staffed."
Biden holds 1st Cabinet meeting the day after proposing sweeping infrastructure plan,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-hold-1st-cabinet-meeting-day-proposing-sweeping/story?id=76810053,"One day after announcing his massive infrastructure plan, President Joe Biden held his first in-person Cabinet meeting Thursday afternoon at the White House, tasking five members of his Cabinet to take the lead on selling the proposal to the American people -- and Congress. In brief remarks at the top of the meeting, Biden announced that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo would take on the additional responsibility. In conjunction with his White House staff, Biden said the group of former mayors and governors will ""represent me in dealing with Congress, engage the public ... and help work out the details as we refine it and move forward."" ""I want to thank them in advance for the role they're going to play with this added assignment I'm asking them to take on. And we'll be discussing that today, among other things,"" Biden said of the meeting, at which the new infrastructure proposal was expected to be a major topic of conversation. Biden also issued a directive to his Cabinet members as they work to advance his agenda, asking them to follow through on the ""Buy American"" executive action he took back in January ""to make sure that when the government is spending taxpayers’ money that they're spending it on American-made goods, American corporations and American employees."" ""Today, I'm directing every member of the Cabinet, I mean this sincerely, everyone, to take a hard look at their agency spending and make sure it follows my 'Buy American' standard,"" Biden told the group. ""I'm going to ask you all to report back to me at the next Cabinet meeting."" The 25-person meeting included the 15 confirmed head of departments, plus seven Cabinet-level department heads, including Shalanda Young, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget. Biden’s initial choice for the role, Neera Tanden, withdrew her nomination due to opposition in the Senate. Vice President Kamala Harris and White House chief of staff Ron Klain, both members of the Cabinet, were also in attendance, along with nine senior members of the White House staff, including National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice and White House COVID-19 Coordinator Jeff Zients. The meeting looked different than previous ones as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of taking place in the Cabinet Room, the traditional venue, the group gathered in the East Room to abide by public health guidelines and allow for social distancing. The gathering was timed to follow Biden’s launch of the first portion of his new infrastructure plan, a multi-trillion-dollar proposal aimed at traditional infrastructure projects to repair roads, rails and bridges, but which also includes billions to expand broadband internet access, community-based care for elderly Americans and investments in clean energy. ""It's not a plan that tinkers around the edges,"" Biden said in a speech in Pittsburgh Wednesday. ""It's a once-in-a-generation investment in America, unlike anything we've seen or done since we built the interstate highway system and the space race decades ago. In fact, it's the largest American jobs investment since World War II."" The meeting was expected to focus on not only infrastructure and the role Cabinet members will play but also the continued implementation and communication on Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill, according to a White House official. The press availability at the top of the meeting drew a sharp contrast with former President Donald Trump’s lengthier press availability during his first Cabinet meeting in June 2017, during which members of his Cabinet offered effusive praise for the then-president, who offered his own praise for his administration’s accomplishments despite no major legislation having yet passed through Congress. No members of Biden's Cabinet spoke during the brief press availability, which lasted less than two minutes."
Teen cheerleader's Snapchat brings Supreme Court clash over schools and free speech,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/teen-cheerleaders-snapchat-brings-supreme-court-clash-schools/story?id=76396105,"MAHANOY CITY, Pa.  -- When 14-year-old Brandi Levy didn't make the varsity cut as a freshman cheerleader for the Mahanoy Golden Bears, she sounded off on social media, as teenagers are known to do. ""I was frustrated. I was upset. I was angry. And I  ,"" Levy told  . ""I said, 'F school, F cheer, F softball, F everything.'"" When she posted the vulgar message to her friends on a weekend in 2017, she never thought she'd hear about it again. But days later, the school accused her of breaching a code of conduct and   for an entire year. Levy's   post and the punishment that followed are now at the center of a major U.S. Supreme Court case that tests the boundaries of school discipline and the rights of students to free speech. ""This is the first time that the U.S. Supreme Court is going to decide whether the rules that apply to kids when they're in school also apply to their speech when they are outside of school,"" said Sara Rose, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney defending Levy in the case. The court in a famous   said that students   their First Amendment rights at the schoolhouse gate, but that educators can limit speech on school property when it's materially disruptive. It has not addressed how school-related speech expressed off-campus can be handled. ""This case is so important because it has implications, not just for school leaders in Pennsylvania, but across the nation to be able to provide for the safety and welfare of students in their schools,"" said Paul Healy, executive director of the Pennsylvania Principals Association, which is backing the Mahanoy Area School District in the case. Two lower federal courts sided with Levy in the dispute, ordering her returned to the team in 2017 and allowed her to continue her cheerleading career.  Later, in a sweeping decision, a federal appeals court affirmed the decision, saying a school's authority to enforce the rules ""does not apply off-campus."" ""If they would have just taken her aside and said, 'Watch; be careful.' But the action they took, I think reached above and beyond where they should be,"" said Larry Levy, Brandi's father, who sued the school with help from ACLU. ""When they're not under their school supervision, kids are under their parents supervision and the parents are the ones who should be able to decide what's appropriate for their children to say when they're at home,"" Rose said. The Mahanoy School District, which declined ABC News' request for an interview, says in court documents that the appellate decision threatens to handcuff coaches, principals and teachers nationwide. ""The First Amendment is not a territorial straitjacket that forces schools to ignore speech, that disrupts the school environment,"" the school district writes in its brief to the Supreme Court. ""Coaches and school administrators, not federal courts, should decide whether the coach can bench someone or ask a player to apologize to teammates,"" it said. ""The First Amendment is not a tool for micromanaging school determinations."" Healy said schools must be able to discipline students for inappropriate conduct online if they would clearly be disciplined for the same conduct offline. ""If you're going to be involved in an extracurricular activity and you sign that code of conduct, you're held to a higher standard,"" he said. ""You're supposed to be an ambassador of the school."" Levy maintains her Snapchat did not violate a school cheerleading code that required ""respect"" and ""no negative information"" to be expressed while part of the team. ""I think that it didn't because I was not directing towards any coaches. I didn't have the school's name in it. I didn't have the coaches' name or any teammates' names in it,"" she said. School officials disagree. ""That type of language and that type of rhetoric causes the school harm and can cause a disruption in the school,"" Healy said. ""Social media takes it to another step, right? There's a wider audience."" State and national associations of school superintendents, school boards, teachers and principals have all filed legal briefs supporting Mahanoy Area School District in the case, warning that a decision restricting off-campus discipline would hurt efforts to ensure safety and order and to combat  . Roughly one in three American middle or high school students say they've been victims of online harassment, according to the  . The group has found that the threat of punishment by schools is a key deterrent to would-be bullies. ""If they perceived that they would get in trouble at school for cyberbullying, they were significantly less likely to do it,"" said Justin Patchin, co-director of the center and a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. ""If the courts come down and say, look, if it happens away from school, there's nothing you can do about it, I think that's going to potentially open up a lot of concern."" Maurine Molak of San Antonio, Texas, knows that concern first hand. Seven years ago, her 16-year-old son David was relentlessly targeted online by bullies as a high school sophomore and later took his own life. ""We went to the school for help, and because a lot of it had occurred off-campus, the jurisdiction of the school was in question,"" Molak told ABC News Live. ""And we tried to do everything that we possibly could. We moved schools. We talked to law enforcement, and our son David became feeling helpless and hopeless and he died by suicide."" Molak, who runs the  , said schools nationwide need more authority to intervene in cases of cyberbullying and that the campus boundary shouldn't be used as a shield. ""You would have a perpetrator's parents who would go to the school and say, you don't have jurisdiction over this and you can't punish my child because this did not happen on your ground, on your campus, in your school walls and that was just not right,"" she said. Molak said the Supreme Court case this month could  to save lives. ""I don't want to see that happen,"" she said. Free speech advocates said that while they don't condone bullying, Levy's case and others like it highlight how school discipline can go too far. ""In this country, we protect speech, even if it's offensive, even if it's disruptive, because we believe in the marketplace of ideas. And I think that's the lesson we need to teach kids,"" said the ACLU's Rose. ""Not that the government has broad authority to punish you for anything you say, no matter where you are."" Kimberly Diei, a graduate student at the University of Tennessee, told ABC News she empathizes with Brandi Levy over school punishment for off-campus postings on social media after her school tried to expel her over images it found objectionable. ""I do agree that there should be standards that are set, and I don't believe that anyone should be able to break the law off campus and then face no consequences from the institution,"" said Diei, ""But like I said, nothing I've done has caused any harm. The university, which declined comment to ABC News, later reversed the decision to expel. ""I can understand that there would be differences between adults in a doctorate program or other professional program versus high school students. But everyone has a personal life. Some people choose to be more open with theirs,"" Diei said. For Brandi Levy, the public spotlight was never something she wanted, but now said the Supreme Court could use her case to affirm the rights of teenagers everywhere. ""I just want the Supreme Court to realize that every person and every student and young adults have their freedom of speech and that the schools can't punish students for what they say outside of school and not in school grounds or school hours,"" she said. As for her own controversial Snapchat, Levy feels a tinge of regret, but offered no apologies. ""Now that I think about it, I feel like I shouldn't have done it, but it just -- it is what it is. I was 14, I was young. I wasn't thinking,"" she said. The court will hear arguments in the case on April 28 and hand down a decision by the end of June."
"Hunter Biden, in new memoir, offers lurid details of addiction but sidesteps some political scandals",politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/memoir-hunter-biden-seeks-reframe-political-scandals-omits/story?id=76813811,"After a year of withering attacks from President   and his allies during the 2020 campaign, Hunter Biden has emerged with a new memoir that seeks to reframe some of the scandals that nearly derailed his father's presidential bid -- but he almost entirely ignores others, leaving questions about the nation's First Family unresolved. In ""Beautiful Things,"" out next week, Hunter Biden charts a life defined by tragedy, addiction and scandal -- all in the shadow of a doting and concerned father,  , whose ascent to the White House came during some of his son's darkest moments. The account marks Hunter Biden's most extensive commentary to date on topics that emerged as fodder for his father's political foes during the presidential campaign, including his struggles with substance addiction and his efforts to make a profitable career while navigating the challenges and benefits of sharing his name with a powerful father. His dealings in   and his seat on the board of a Ukrainian oil and gas firm during his father's tenure as vice president became an   and his allies, with Trump's drive to find dirt on Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine leading directly to his first impeachment trial. While Biden opens up on some of those topics, the book makes no mention of an ongoing federal investigation into his taxes, contains no new details about his controversial investments in China, and makes no meaningful nod to the mystery surrounding his infamous laptop -- the contents of which were dumped online and weaponized by Trump and his supporters in the waning weeks of the presidential campaign. ""Where's Hunter? I'm right here. I've faced and survived worse,"" he writes. ""I've known the extremes of success and ruin … I come from a family forged by tragedies and bound by a remarkable unbreakable love. I'm not going anywhere."" For what it lacks in clarity on some subjects, Biden's memoir makes up for with lurid and deeply troubling detail on others, most notably his repeated relapses into drug and alcohol abuse. The connective tissue for the story he tells is his older brother, Beau Biden, whose battle with brain cancer, Hunter writes, served as the impetus for his decision to take work with the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma in 2014. ""I want to be clear: Beau's health problems didn't prompt me to do something I wouldn't have done otherwise. The money was helpful, but I could've figured out another way to make it,"" Hunter Biden explained. ""I wasn't desperate. Yet it did provide me the ability not to work as hard at continuing to develop clients … that gave me more time to tend to Beau."" ""I'm not saying I would not have taken Burisma's offer if Beau hadn't gotten sick -- the money helped,"" he continued. In many ways, the book picks up where Biden left off following a handful of   he gave during the presidential campaign to try and diffuse the burgeoning scandals. As he did in his   with ABC News, Hunter Biden displays defiance about his work in Ukraine and China, discarding allegations of wrongdoing as a ""political fable"" and ""conspiratorial delusion"" intended to discredit his father's political ambitions. He insists that his only mistake was in failing to anticipate the onslaught of attention his role with Burisma would attract from Trump, his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and ""their circle of bandits."" In defending his overseas work, Biden points the finger back at the Trump family, who faced allegations of using the White House as a platform to bolster their business brand. ""I became a proxy for Donald Trump's fear that he won't be reelected,"" Biden wrote. ""He pushed debunked conspiracy theories about work I did in Ukraine and China, even as his own children had pocketed millions in China and Russia and his former campaign manager sat in a jail cell for laundering millions more from Ukraine"" -- an apparent reference to former Trump campaign chairman  , who in 2018 was found guilty of tax and bank fraud related to business transactions conducted prior to his work on Trump's 2016 campaign, and was later  . But Trump's political allies weren't the only ones scrutinizing Hunter Biden's business dealings during the campaign. Government ethics watchdogs also took issue with the son of a high-profile politician creating the appearance of a conflict of interest by taking on overlapping work. Both Hunter Biden and his father -- who, as vice president, played a key role in conducting U.S. foreign policy in Ukraine and China at the time -- have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. ""There's no question that my last name has opened doors, but my qualifications and accomplishments speak for themselves,"" Hunter Biden wrote. ""That those accomplishments sometimes crossed my father's spheres of influence during his two terms as vice-president -- how could they not?"" Throughout the book, Joe Biden is cast in a recurring role as Hunter Biden's lifeline, guiding him through moments of seemingly insurmountable difficulty in his relationships and his  . During one of many alcohol-fueled benders depicted in the book, Hunter Biden describes the then-vice president arriving at his Washington, D.C., apartment to check in on him. ""The last thing I wanted was Dad showing up in front of my apartment building with his massive security detail.  But almost a month in, he'd had enough.  He reduced his security to a minimum and knocked on my door.  I let him in,"" Hunter wrote. ""He looked aghast at what he saw. He asked if I was okay and I told him, sure, I was fine. 'I know you're not fine, Hunter,' he said, studying me, scanning the apartment. 'You need help.'  I looked into my dad's eyes and saw an expression of despair, an expression of fear."" The intimate details Hunter Biden shares in the book offer a glimpse into the personal and political challenges he created behind the scenes for his father as the longtime senator sought the White House.  But for the Biden family's critics, ""Beautiful Things"" will do little to explain some of the more troubling allegations Hunter faced during and after the campaign. In many cases, Hunter spares no detail in recounting difficult moments from his past, but glides over others -- including his discharge from the U.S. Navy Reserves in 2014 after cocaine appeared in a failed drug test. The most notable omission, perhaps, is any mention of the   into Hunter Biden's taxes, which he revealed in December after his father's electoral victory was sealed. ABC News has also reported that federal investigators in Delaware are looking into Hunter's business dealings in China -- another topic light on new details in the memoir. Hunter Biden's account of his work in China matches previous comments he's made on the matter, including in his   with ABC News. He describes taking a 2013 trip to Beijing with his father and daughter, Finnegan, on Air Force Two, introducing his father to a Chinese business associate, and helping launch a fledgling investment firm. ""And that was that,"" Hunter wrote, ""until Trump declared I walked out of China with $1.5 billion"" -- a figure Hunter has repeatedly disputed, claiming that the fund once aspired to raise that amount, but at the time had only scraped together $4.2 million. Hunter claims he bought a 10% stake in the firm after his father left the vice presidency. Another strange interlude from the election is also missing from ""Beautiful Things"": neither a denial that the incident occurred nor an explanation of the laptop Hunter Biden allegedly discarded at a Wilmington, Delaware, computer repair shop that later made its way into the hands of Giuliani. The contents of the laptop -- which included emails, text messages, and photos purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden -- were first reported by the New York Post. ABC News was not able to verify the contents of the laptop. The memoir also omits any mention of a former business partner who accused the Bidens of misleading the public about their overseas business dealings. Tony Bobulinski, in a remarkable moment of political theater, held a hastily organized press conference moments before the second presidential debate in October to accuse Joe Biden of lying about his knowledge of Hunter's foreign business dealings. Bobulinski’s accusations were based on unverified emails from May 2017 -- after Joe Biden had left the White House. At the time of his accusations, Bobulinski was being advised by a former counsel from the Trump administration who was later on the payroll of the Trump Organization,  . Bobulinski told reporters his allegations were ""corroborated by emails, WhatsApp chats, agreements, documents, and other evidence,"" including three cellphones he said he would be handing over to Senate Republicans later that week. Copies of the documents Bobulinski gave to Congress were obtained by ABC News, which was unable to verify their authenticity. But they did not do what Biden's critics alleged: provide conclusive evidence that Joe Biden was aware of, or benefited from, any deal. On the night of the Bobulinski press conference, Trump incorporated the fresh allegations against Biden into his attacks on the debate stage. Biden denied the charges and fired back with an impassioned defense of his son, which Hunter recounted in an epilogue written as a posthumous letter to his brother, Beau. ""Dad countered artfully, empathetically, indelibly,"" Hunter wrote. ""'My son,' he said, ignoring Trump while looking straight into a camera, 'like a lot of people you know at home, had a drug problem. He's overtaken it, he's fixed it, he's worked on it. And I'm proud of him. I'm proud of my son.'"" ""Those words not only disarmed Trump but gave comfort and hope to millions of Americans,"" Hunter continued. ""I felt nothing but pride. You would've too."" The memoir is filled with anecdotes about Hunter Biden's cycle of addiction, recovery and relapse that consumed his life for years, including a time in 2018 when he ""holed up"" at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles and spent six weeks smoking crack -- and learning to cook crack -- with his drug dealer and his prostitute girlfriend. ""I never slept. There was no clock. Day bled into night and night into day,"" he wrote. ""I came to dread sleep.  If I rested too long between hits on a pipe, I'd be thrown into a panic."" Hunter Biden ultimately explains how he managed to crawl out from the ""black hole of alcoholism and drug abuse,"" in no small part due to the support of his wife, Melissa, whom he married after only a brief courtship, in 2019. The two now have a baby, Beau, who is featured multiple times in the book -- as are his three older daughters. But other family matters are handled clumsily -- notably his fifth child, Navy, who is largely missing from the book. Navy was the subject of a paternity case in Arkansas after Hunter refused to pay child support to the baby's mother; he settled the suit for an undisclosed sum in March 2020 after a paternity test found with ""certainty"" that he was the father. ""Beautiful Things,"" scheduled for release on April 6, is being published by Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster."
Bidens use Easter message to promote COVID-19 vaccinations,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bidens-easter-message-promote-covid-19-vaccinations/story?id=76833587,"As many Americans prepare to celebrate Easter on Sunday, President   and first lady   are cautioning that the coronavirus is still with us and are encouraging people to get vaccinated. ""We share the sentiments of Pope Francis who said that getting vaccinated is a moral obligation, one that can save your life and the lives of others,"" Biden said in a prerecorded video message alongside the first lady. ""By getting vaccinated and encouraging your congregations in their communities to get vaccinated, we not only can beat this virus, we can also haste the day we can celebrate the holidays together again,"" he said. Biden, a   who regularly attends Mass on weekends, also consoled Christians who ""are still going without familiar comforts of the season."" ""So many of us still feel the longing and loneliness of distance,"" he said. ""For a second year, most will be apart from their families, their friends, full congregations that fill us with joy. And yet as the gospel of John reminds us, the light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it."" The first lady focused on hope for the future, saying ""the traditions of Holy Week take us on a journey from sorrow to salvation, reminding us that with faith, hope and love, anything is possible."" Nearly 553,000 Americans have died from   and health officials are now worried about another spike in cases across the country. The U.S. is now averaging roughly 5,000 new COVID-19 hospital admissions every day, and hospitalizations are up in 20 states.

Partisanship emerges as Biden's best hope for next phase of agenda: The Note,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/partisanship-emerges-bidens-best-hope-phase-agenda-note/story?id=76815137,"It's an odd goal to aspire to, particularly after your campaign was built on unity and the promise of working together. But the initial rollout of President Joe Biden's broadly structured and quite   has made clear how much   from here relies on partisanship -- no, not its opposite. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying to dispel any doubt about the possibility of Republican support for the president, calling Biden's a ""bold, left-wing administration"" on Thursday. ""I'm going to fight them every step of the way,"" said McConnell, R-Ky. Lining up to oppose Biden continues to be a source of unity for the GOP. The White House and congressional Democrats know that, and while Biden can't and won't say he's not interested in pursuing Republican support, mechanisms are falling into place that will likely make it unnecessary. That, though, doesn't make passing infrastructure or   or   or   easy. Getting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to agree with Sen. Joe Manchin may be easier than securing McConnell's support, though not by much. The refrain from the White House remains that Biden's big-ticket items are bipartisan because  for them. That notion will be tested as Democrats debate tax hikes and vast expansions of social programs basically among themselves. Still, if Congress is going to pass those bills into law, it will be   behind a still-popular president and his initiatives -- not because Republicans are helping Biden out. As Biden pushes his infrastructure plan, members of his administration are emphasizing aspects of it that address environmental racism. ""The impacts and pollution and the climate crisis disproportionately threaten the lives and livelihoods of Americans of color,"" said Catherine Lhamon, deputy director of the Domestic Policy Council for Racial Justice and Equity. ""It is time for long overdue investments to tackle systemic racism and rebuild our economy and our social safety net so that every person in America can realize their full potential."" According to a  , African Americans are 75% more likely than white Americans to live in communities adjacent to businesses that produce hazardous waste.    found that Blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately exposed to polluted air. Biden's plan aims to eliminate all lead pipes across the country, provide targeted investments in communities hard hit by natural disasters -- like flooding -- and mitigate impacts of pollution in communities of color where people are more likely to die of asthma than their white counterparts. Some progressives argue the plan   and Republicans have balked at the $2.5 trillion plan. Despite mixed feelings from lawmakers on the plan, the provisions of Biden's plan that aim to root out environmental inequity undoubtedly follow through on Biden's pledge to address racial disparities in all aspects of government. Following Georgia enacting a   that critics have called ""Jim Crow 2.0,"" the non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice released   of state-level proposed legislation that contains provisions restricting voting access. As of March 24, 361  had been introduced in all but three state legislatures, according to its analysis; the states with the most restrictive bills are Texas, Georgia and Arizona. Georgia's 2021   Wednesday, so there won't be any more legislative action from the Peach State soon -- though   is already underway as three lawsuits have been filed seeking to block enforcement of the new law. But in Texas and Arizona, bills are advancing. While most Americans were asleep Thursday morning, Republicans in the Texas senate advanced a bill that would ban drive-thru voting and limit early voting hours to between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. Majority-minority Harris County, a Democratic stronghold, offered drive-thru voting and 24-hour early voting in November. Debate started Thursday in the Arizona state house on a bill that would eliminate the ""permanent"" part of the state's early voting list by requiring election officials to remove any voters who don't respond to a notice after not voting early in at least one primary or general election over two cycles. After about 20 minutes of debate, the bill was   and not voted on. It passed the senate already, but every Republican in the house must vote for the bill or it will fail.

"CDC says fully vaccinated Americans can safely travel, but still recommends against nonessential trips",politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cdc-fully-vaccinated-americans-resume-low-risk-travel/story?id=76834280,"Fully vaccinated individuals can safely travel inside the U.S. and internationally, the CDC said in  , though they should still wear a mask when traveling on public transportation, including airplanes. The CDC says recent research on the effectiveness of the COVID-19   indicates there is low risk to vaccinated individuals and that they can travel without a COVID-19 test or quarantining after traveling. Still, the CDC is not ""recommending"" travel at this time due to the  , according to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky. ""We know that right now we have a surging number of cases. I would advocate against general travel overall. Our guidance is silent on recommending or not recommending fully vaccinated people travel. Our guidance speaks to the safety of doing so. If you're -- if you are vaccinated it is lower at risk,"" she said in a briefing Friday. The CDC is only recommending testing for travelers who are returning to the U.S. from international travel -- keeping in place an order it announced in mid-January that requires all US-bound passengers to present a negative COVID-19 test before boarding. For fully vaccinated Americans, this updated CDC guidance relieves much of the stress that comes with incorporating COVID-19 restrictions into travel plans. The CDC does note, however, that Americans still need to follow the guidelines set by other countries for international travel, including testing or quarantining. The new guidance comes as nearly a third of the country's adult population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The CDC defines a person as ""fully-vaccinated"" two weeks after they’ve received their last dose. In the case of J&J, a one-shot vaccine, that means two weeks after the first and only shot. For Pfizer and Moderna, it's two weeks after the second shot. The CDC is still recommending unvaccinated people avoid all nonessential travel. ""We haven't changed our guidance for nonessential travel at all. We are not recommending travel at this time, especially for unvaccinated individuals,"" Walensky said. ""Our guidance on an unvaccinated individual really is to limit travel to only essential travel with masking, protective -- prevention strategies. And so our update on this is really only for those who are vaccinated, and that represents about 20% of the adult population."" White House COVID-19 adviser Andy Slavitt also asked Americans not to travel unless necessary. ""It is safe to travel without quarantining if fully vaccinated. Still, with cases rising & variants spreading, non-essential travel is not recommended yet,"" he tweeted just as CDC released the new guidance. The CDC has said it will continue to update guidance about how to socialize, travel and return to workplaces as more Americans get vaccinated. Fully vaccinated individuals can safely socialize indoors without masks or social distancing with other vaccinated individuals but should still avoid groups with unvaccinated people from multiple households,  . When that guidance was released in early March, Walensky said the agency would   until a higher percentage of Americans were vaccinated and the agency had more evidence regarding whether vaccinated individuals could spread the virus. Despite previous warnings against travel from the CDC, the   has continued to see a considerable uptick in passengers as the vaccine rollout grows. More than a million people have passed through TSA checkpoints every day since March 11. Walensky acknowledged that it is confusing to hear messages both about what vaccinated can do and the CDC asking people not to do them because of the concerning increase in the number of COVID-19 cases among unvaccinated people. ""The science shows us that getting fully vaccinated allows you to do more things safely, and it is important for us to provide that guidance, even in the context of rising cases. At the same time, we must balance this guidance with the fact that most Americans are not yet fully vaccinated, which is likely contributing to our rise in cases,"" she said. ""And that means we have to continue to reinforce messages about the critical importance of COVID-19 prevention measures."""

Biden's infrastructure plan tests Democratic unity in Congress,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bidens-infrastructure-plan-tests-democratic-unity-congress/story?id=76810133,"President   unveiled his sweeping infrastructure proposal to expected opposition from Republicans. But before he can worry about finding sympathetic GOP lawmakers, he'll have to contend with members of his own party who are skeptical of the $2 trillion proposal. The plan introduced in Pittsburgh Wednesday is expected to be the first of two large packages   the nation's infrastructure and creating jobs. ""It's big, yes,"" Biden said at a press event on Tuesday. ""It's bold, yes. And we can get it done."" But the path forward on Capitol Hill for such a massive spending bill is precarious. If Democrats want to move swiftly, they'll likely need to do so using reconciliation, a procedural budget tool that allows passage of legislation without the necessary 60 votes to overcome a Senate filibuster. But Biden needs to hang onto moderate Democrats because a single Democratic defection in the evenly split Senate could sink the bill's chances. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., pushed to include more moderate proposals in the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill and may seek similar concessions on infrastructure. ""Infrastructure, my God, when you think about it, that pothole doesn't have an R or D name on it, it'll blow your tire and ruin your car, it doesn't care,"" Manchin said during a panel last week. ""So, don't you think infrastructure is something that could bring us together?"" Manchin also cautioned his colleagues against adding unrelated items to the bill because he said he believes an infrastructure package could get a large, bipartisan backing ""unless you throw everything on top of it, all of your pent-up social frustration."" And therein lies the challenge in the House, where Biden can only afford to lose three Democrats given the tight margins and some progressive members are calling on the administration to go bigger and bolder. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,   Tuesday that Biden's plan falls short of expectations. ""This is not nearly enough. The important context here is that it's $2.25T spread out over 10 years,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted after details of the plan were released. ""For context, the COVID package was $1.9T for this year *alone,* with some provisions lasting 2 years. Needs to be way bigger."" The Congressional Progressive Caucus called the plan a ""welcome first step,"" but one that ""can and should be substantially larger in size and scope."" ""We have a limited window to get this done -- we must seize our chance to build back better with economy-wide investments that work for working families and communities of color,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, chair of the caucus, said in a statement Tuesday. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell pushed back on that notion. ""I don't think they have a mandate to do what they're doing,"" he said at a press event in Kentucky on Thursday. ""If you look at the results in Congress, the 50-50 Senate and maybe a three-vote majority in the House, I don't think the American people gave them a mandate to drive our country all the way to the political left."" While Biden has been clear that he'll seek bipartisan support, during a conversation with Politico on Thursday, White House chief of staff Ron Klain said it is not necessarily a requirement. ""In the end, let me be clear: The president was elected to do a job. And part of that job is to get this country ready to win the future. That's what he's going to do,"" Klain said. ""We know what has bipartisan support in the country. And so we're gonna try our best to get bipartisan support here in Washington."" Klain said the president's proposal is meant as a starting point for further conversation. Several rank-and-file Senate Democrats are largely in favor of the Biden proposal and multiple members touted the bill's historic nature and praised it for being a job creator in statements released Wednesday. But even those championing the bill are also hoping to see changes to it. Biden has proposed funding the massive plan by implementing tax reforms. The most notable would raise taxes on large corporations to pay for the bill, walking back some of the corporate tax cuts pushed through by the Trump administration. Biden has promised that no one earning under $400,000 would see a tax raise to pay for the infrastructure proposal. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats are hoping that the infrastructure bill might be a vehicle to overturn another Trump-era tax rule. Schumer, who is largely supportive of the overall Biden proposal, said he plans to ""fight hard"" to get caps on state and local tax deductions, also known as SALT deductions, lifted as part of the bill. Under President Donald Trump's tax reform in 2017, a $10,000 limit was imposed on the amount of state and local tax that could be deducted from federal tax dues. The cap most severely impacts residents of states with higher state income taxes, such as the traditionally liberal states like New York and California. House Democrats are also rallying for changes to the SALT rules. ""I am not going to support any change in the tax code unless there is a restoration of the SALT deduction,"" Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., said in a statement Monday. It's unclear if any Democrats will actually vote against the package on the floor, but if the administration is looking to shore up its chances and avoid being derailed by Democratic defectors, it may be hard pressed to find sympathetic Republicans. Infrastructure has traditionally been a space for bipartisan cooperation, but Republicans said this package is too broadly focused. Biden personally called McConnell on Tuesday to brief him on the sweeping package, but the Republican described the infrastructure bill as a Trojan horse that is hiding ""more borrowed money and massive tax increases on all the productive parts of our economy."" ""I think that package that they are putting together now -- as much as we would like to address infrastructure -- is not going to get support from our side,"" McConnell said Thursday. ""The last thing the economy needs right now is a big whopping tax increase."" He also slammed the administration for trying to go it alone. Democrats rammed through the   spending bill on strict party lines, without a single Republican backer. While many moderate Republicans have yet to weigh in, it's possible this infrastructure package will also have to ride entirely on the backs of Democrats. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, said the Biden proposal was a far cry from a serious infrastructure proposal. ""President Biden's so-called 'jobs' proposal is a clear attempt to transform the economy by advancing progressive priorities in an unprecedented way,"" Moore Capito said in a statement. Still, Biden said Wednesday that he was hopeful Republicans would ultimately support the proposal and that he was open to ideas about ""how to pay for this plan."" He said he would invite Republicans to the Oval Office and listen to them. ""These are my ideas on how to pay for this plan,"" he said. ""If others have additional ideas, let them come forward. I'm open to other ideas, so long as they do not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000."""

""The Office of Congressman Matt Gaetz and Luke Ball have agreed that it would be best to part ways. We thank him for his time in our office, and we wish him the best moving forward,"" Gaetz's office said in a statement.

The Hill newspaper reported Friday afternoon that Gaetz said he has no plans to step down. Gaetz said in a text exchange with the paper that rumors he plans to resign are ""false"" and that it is ""very safe"" to say he doesn't have any intention to do so, The Hill reported.

Greenberg pleaded not guilty to the charges. The details of the investigation were first reported by The New York Times, two days after the paper revealed that an investigation was underway. The disclosure has sent shockwaves through Republican circles, particularly among close associates of former President  , who considered Gaetz a staunch ally and loyal friend. Gaetz's office did not respond to a request for comment, but earlier this week Gaetz insisted on Fox News that he never ""had a relationship with a 17-year-old,"" calling such allegations ""totally false."" According to the Times, investigators believe Greenberg met women through certain websites and introduced some of them to Gaetz. As recently as 2019 and 2020, Gaetz and Greenberg told women to meet them at hotels in Florida, laying out how much they were willing to pay beforehand, the newspaper said, adding that party drugs may have also been used by Gaetz and others at times.

Then-Attorney General Bill Barr was briefed on the investigation's progress several times, the sources said. A lawyer for Greenberg did not respond to ABC News' request for comment. Greenberg served a controversial stint as Seminole County tax collector until he resigned last summer following his arrest by federal authorities. Prior to joining Congress, Gaetz was a member of the Florida House of Representatives when his father was also a member of the Florida Senate. Sources told ABC News the two were often referred to as ""Daddy Gaetz and Baby Gaetz."" Sources said some women referred to him as ""Creepy Gaetz"" because they allegedly found themselves made uncomfortable by the junior lawmaker. Sources said Gaetz was part of a group of young male lawmakers who created a ""game"" to score their female sexual conquests, which granted ""points"" for various targets such as interns, staffers or other female colleagues in the state House. One of the targets of the scoring system was a group the lawmakers had heard were ""virgins,"" according to a source. The scoring system by male Florida lawmakers was  . One source said Gaetz was often spotted trying to pick up young women at 101 Restaurant, a once-popular watering hole in Tallahassee for some lawmakers and students from nearby Florida State University. While on Capitol Hill as a member of Congress, Gaetz allegedly boasted of his sexual encounters with women, and would allegedly try to show colleagues photos and videos of naked women he said he slept with, according to sources familiar with Gaetz’s actions. One video in particular was of a naked woman with a hula hoop, according to a source who was shown the material -- an allegation first reported by CNN. Gaetz's office did not respond to a request for comment. During an interview on Fox News, Gaetz claimed he was being extorted over the investigation and claimed that someone had alleged there were ""pictures of me with child prostitutes,"" which he said was ""obviously false.""

"Dell, American Airlines, AT&T weigh in on restrictive voting bills in Texas",politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dell-american-airlines-att-weigh-restrictive-voting-bills/story?id=76809993,"Amid a growing national discourse over ballot access, several major companies voiced concerns -- and in some cases, outright objections -- over bills that voting rights advocates say would make it harder to vote in Texas. Dell and American Airlines specifically called out Texas Senate Bill 7 and its version in the House, House Bill 6, while AT&T took a broader look at the complexity of elections, the responsibility of lawmakers, and a broader ""responsibility to engage."" ""Instead of seeking to limit access, governments should provide innovative pathways for citizens to have their voices heard. Legislation like HB6 does the opposite, and we are opposed to it,"" a statement from Dell, that added that voting rights had been especially ""hard-earned"" by ""women and communities of color,"" said. State Senate Republicans advanced SB7 in the early hours of Thursday morning. The legislation proposes changing existing voting rules, including shortening early voting hours and banning drive-through voting, which was popular among heavily populated, diverse areas when voters cast ballots in November. The Senate bill also prohibits election officials from sending out mail voting applications to voters if they did not individually request the forms, and requires disabled voters to provide specific proof of disability from the federal government or a physician. That same day, the Texas House Elections Committee heard testimonies about their chamber's version of the bill. While HB6 echoed the Senate bill's provisions regarding mail ballot solicitation, it also included new rules for how voters could be assisted with filling out their ballots and expanded the access poll-watchers could have within polling places. American Airlines directed its statement at the Senate bill, saying it included ""provisions that limit voting access."" ""To make American's stance clear: We are strongly opposed to this bill and others like it. As a Texas-based business, we must stand up for the rights of our team members and customers who call Texas home, and honor the sacrifices made by generations of Americans to protect and expand the right to vote,"" the statement said. Although none of the companies explicitly indicated an intent to explore economic ramifications against the state or its Republican lawmakers if the bills were made into law, their statements were a signal that some of the biggest corporate stakeholders -- and employers -- in Texas are keeping track of the bills. In a statement issued on the heels of American Airlines' comment, Texas Lieutenant Gov. Dan Patrick alleged the airline giant's government relations representative called his office minutes before and ""admitted that neither he nor the American Airlines CEO had actually read the legislation."" ""Texans are fed up with corporations that don't share our values trying to dictate public policy. The majority of Texans support maintaining the integrity of our elections, which is why I made it a priority this legislative session,"" Patrick said. The Republican-led focus on ""election integrity"" comes just months after voter turnout reached new heights across the Lone Star State in the lead-up to the pandemic-era 2020 election -- and after Texas Democrats laid out their roadmap for flipping the state blue in coming years. Texas-based voting rights advocates decried the efforts as being especially detrimental to voter groups that traditionally make up Democrats' base. ""These bills, if passed, are going to make it harder [to vote] and aim specifically to suppress minority voter turnout. They would undermine the ability of local election officials to encourage voter participation and they create new barriers for voters themselves,"" U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey, a Democrat from Texas, said of the bills on a press call with reporters. Meanwhile, some disability advocates say the parameters set by SB7 would make disabled voters face an equivalent of a poll tax, given that not every disabled person who is eligible to vote is also able to present an official, documented diagnosis like the legislation demands. With high political stakes on the line, Charlie Bonner, a spokesperson for the grassroots group MOVE Texas, suggested the legislative push could ultimately backfire on Republicans. ""I think what we've seen time and time again, is Texans hate a cheater. They see what's happening now -- that Gov. (Greg) Abbott and his cronies in the House and Senate can't win on the issue, so they're trying to change the rules. People see that and they understand what's happening,"" Bonner told reporters during a recent call."
Suspect identified in killing of officer at US Capitol barricade: Sources,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/shots-fired-us-capitol-barricade-sources/story?id=76838165,"One of two injured U.S. Capitol Police officers has died after being hit by a suspect who then rammed their car into the north barricade of the Capitol complex Friday afternoon before exiting the vehicle with a knife, acting Chief Yogananda Pittman said at a press conference. Police opened fire and the suspect is dead, Pittman said. ""The suspect exited the vehicle with a knife in hand. Our officers then engaged that suspect. He did not respond to verbal commands,"" Pittman said. After the suspect lunged at officers, they ""fired upon the suspect."" The officer who died of injuries sustained at the scene has been identified as 18-year Capitol Police veteran William ""Billy"" Evans. ""He began his USCP service on March 7, 2003, and was a member of the Capitol Division’s First Responder’s Unit. Please keep Officer Evans and his family in your thoughts and prayers,"" Pittman said. The suspect who was killed by Capitol Police has been identified as Noah Green, law enforcement sources told ABC News. Authorities believe Green, 25, had ties to Virginia and Indiana, law enforcement sources said. Authorities are taking a close look at social media postings believed to be associated with Green. No clear motive has been established, sources said. Multiple agencies are investigating the incident, including the Capitol Police, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department and the FBI Washington Field Office. The FBI Indianapolis Field Office is also providing support and assisting law enforcement partners in the investigation. The other officer last was reported in ""stable and non-threatening condition."" The Capitol was put on lockdown Friday afternoon. Hill staffers were sent a message from U.S. Capitol Police around 1:20 p.m. saying that ""due to an external security threat ... no entry or exit is permitted."" The message said people could move around inside the building ""but stay away from exterior windows and doors. If you are outside, seek cover."" ""We do not have the suspect on file with U.S. Capitol Police,"" Acting Metro Police Department Chief Robert Contee said. ""So there is no indication at this time that there is any nexus to any member of Congress."" Conte also said the incident didn't appear to be terror related. Congress was in recess when the incident occurred, and many staff offices were closed in observance of Good Friday. There were approximately 2,300 National Guardsmen already on mission at the Capitol following the  , when protesters breached the Capitol -- five people died, including  . The D.C. National Guard deployed an ""Immediate Reaction Force"" to support Capitol Police during Friday's incident, according to a spokesperson. About 40 National Guardsmen lined up with riot gear to block access to Constitution Avenue, just east of where the incident took place. Capitol Police and the National Guard also blocked off roads and pedestrian access near the Supreme Court. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered flags at the Capitol lowered to half-staff in honor of the officer who died, a spokesperson for Pelosi said in a tweet Friday. President Joe Biden also issued a proclamation ordering flags to be flown at half-staff through Tuesday at the White House and on federal grounds in Washington, D.C. In a statement, the president said he and the first lady were “heartbroken” over the deadly attack. “We send our heartfelt condolences to Officer Evans’ family, and everyone grieving his loss. We know what a difficult time this has been for the Capitol, everyone who works there, and those who protect it,” the statement said. Pittman also asked that the public ""keep U.S. Capitol police and their families in your prayers."" ""This has been an extremely difficult time for U.S. Capitol police after the events of January 6 and now the events that have occurred here today. So I ask that you keep our U.S. Capitol police family in your thoughts and prayers,"" she said."
White House starts selling infrastructure plan to American people,politics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-starts-selling-infrastructure-plan-american-people/story?id=76854017,"Four days after President Joe Biden unveiled his massive, multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, the White House is taking steps to sell the policy to the American people as the administration works with Congress on drafting legislation. In his ""Weekly Conversation"" -- Biden’s version of a weekly address -- the president, along with White House press secretary Jen Psaki, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and Deputy White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi, highlighted elements of the policy while answering questions from the public about the plan. The strategy of speaking directly to Americans may prove essential as the proposal faces opposition from both sides of the aisle in Congress, with some progressive Democrats saying the investments do not go far enough, while Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would fight the bill ""every step of the way."" When pressed on McConnell’s pledge to obstruct, Biden pointed to the important role he believes voters will play in passing the policy. ""If the Republicans say the next phase in my plan, we don’t need to invest in VA hospitals and keep the sacred obligation we made to so many Americans. If the Republicans say the 400,000 homes and schools and day care centers that have lead pipes, lead pipes, delivering water to their doors. If they say we shouldn’t be doing that...I think the Republican voters are going to have a lot to say about whether we get a lot of this done,"" Biden warned. The White House is hoping to move forward on dual tracks -- working to bridge divides in Congress while also making inroads with constituents to build support for the policy and increase pressure on lawmakers. The president has already tasked five members of his Cabinet to take the lead on selling the proposal to the American people and Congress. The so-called 'Jobs Cabinet' includes a group of former mayors and governors: Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. ""Working with my team here in the White House, these Cabinet members will represent me in dealing with Congress, engage the public and selling the plan, and help work out the details as we refine it and move forward,"" Biden said at the top of his first in-person Cabinet meeting Thursday. The group's work has already gotten underway: In addition to a media blitz to bring their message to the American people, each member of the group was tasked with making calls to the Democratic chairs and Republican ranking members of committees overseeing their respective departments. The members are also slated to hold a series of committee-specific meetings when members are back in session after the Easter break, a White House official said. The policy, dubbed the ""American Jobs Plan"" by the White House, goes beyond traditional infrastructure projects, with Biden declaring it ""a once-in-a-generation investment in America."" The plan does allocate $621 billion toward modernizing roads, railways, ports, airports, mass transit and highways, as well as $100 billion to eliminate 100% of lead pipes nationwide. But it also includes $400 billion for community-based care for elderly Americans, a $180 billion investment in clean energy and $100 billion to build out high-speed broadband across the country. ""The idea that we're not in a position where we invest in loans and grants to companies and local governments and nonprofits and rural co-ops to be able to come into the 21st century with a minimum requirement of having access to the internet seems to be a very short sighted,"" Biden said during his address Saturday. The White House also took the opportunity to highlight its climate efforts in the bill, which are likely to draw the ire of Republicans. ""This jobs plan upgrades housing. It electrifies transportation. It invests in innovation and it builds out the supply chains that we're going to need to tackle the climate crisis. And at the same time, it targets 40% of the benefits of the investment in the communities that have been disadvantaged,"" Zaidi said during Saturday's question and answer session, outlining the proposal's main climate investments. A White House official said the administration is looking to see ""significant progress"" by Memorial Day, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hoping to get the plan through the House by the Fourth of July, though that timing could slip to later in the month, according to a source familiar with her thinking. The timeline could create a tough road ahead for the White House as it works to bridge the divides in Congress and get the bill passed, though a White House official stressed they expect there will be more time for consultations and input on the plan than there was for the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief measure passed in mid-March without any Republican support. In an interview Thursday, White House chief of staff Ron Klain said the White House wanted to move forward in a bipartisan way ""if at all possible"" but didn’t rule out the idea that Democrats could push the plan through without Republican support, as was the case with Biden’s COVID-19 relief plan. ""In the end, let me be clear: The president was elected to do a job. And part of that job is to get this country ready to win the future. That's what he's going to do. We know it has bipartisan support in the country. And so we're gonna try our best to get bipartisan support here in Washington,"" Klain said."
