"Trump says companies playing to 'woke cancel culture' over Ga. election bill, calls for boycott",politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/trump-suggests-boycotting-ga-businesses-that-condemn-new-voting-law-we-can-play-the-game-better-than-them,"Former President Trump suggested Saturday that Republicans take a page out of what he sees as Democrats' playbook by boycotting the major businesses that have condemned Georgia's new election reform.  ""For years the Radical Left Democrats have played dirty by boycotting products when anything from that company is done or stated in any way that offends them. Now they are going big time with WOKE CANCEL CULTURE and our sacred elections,"" Trump wrote in a statement.  ""It is finally time for Republicans and Conservatives to fight back—we have more people than they do—by far! Boycott Major League Baseball, Coca-Cola, Delta Airlines, JPMorgan Chase, ViacomCBS, Citigroup, Cisco, UPS, and Merck. Don’t go back to their products until they relent,"" he continued.  'We can play the game better than them,"" Trump said.  He then repeated unproven claims that the 2020 election had been ‘rigged’ against him.  ""They rigged and stole our 2020 Presidential Election, which we won by a landslide, and then, on top of that, boycott and scare companies into submission. Never submit, never give up! The Radical Left will destroy our Country if we let them. We will not become a Socialist Nation. Happy Easter!"" the former president wrote.  Some Georgia GOP lawmakers subsequently announced they would remove Coca-Cola products from their statehouse offices. ""Unfortunately, upon the passage of 'Election Integrity Act of 2021,' your company has made the conscious decision to perpetuate a national dialogue which seeks to intentionally mislead the citizens of Georgia and deepen a divide in our great State,"" a number of state lawmakers wrote in a letter.  Large Georgia-based corporations like Coca-Cola and Delta issued statements condemning the state's new legislation after activists called for boycotts. The MLB also moved its All-Star Game and draft out of the state to protest the bill.  Georgia enacted sweeping election reform last week that required voter ID for absentee voting rather than relying on signature matching for verification, limited ballot drop boxes to one per county or one per 100,000 voters, expanded early voting days, and standardized early voting hours to a minimum of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and a maximum of 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. The legislation barred outside groups from passing out food and water to those in line within 150 feet.  The law also handed more election authority to the GOP-controlled estate legislature. It states that the General Assembly is to select the chair of the state elections board, rather than the board being chaired by the Georgia secretary of state. It also shortens run-offs from nine weeks to four.  The state election board can also now investigate county election boards and has the power to suspend county election superintendents — though the board can only suspend four at a time. The law was enacted after a Democratic sweep in the Peach State, which Trump lost to President Biden by just over 11,000 votes. Trump alleged mass election fraud in the state, and sparred with GOP Gov. Brain Kemp and Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s handling of elections. Nine weeks after the November election, Republican incumbent Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler lost to Democrats John Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. "
"Georgia Gov. Kemp hits MLB, Biden after election law prompts All-Star move: Nothing more than 'political play'",politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/georgia-kemp-mlb-biden-election-law-all-star-move,"   on Saturday said the decision to   over objections to changes to his state's   was a ""  play.""  Appearing on   Kemp said it was ""unfortunate"" that the league had ""caved to  "" and accused  , Georgia activist Stacey Abrams and ""a lot of other people"" of lying about the election bill he recently signed into law.  ""It's really a sad day for  ,"" the Republican governor said. ""As somebody that grew up playing   as a kid and a fan, played in high school, you know, big   fan -- I mean, this is terrible for the organization. It's terrible for the fans. It's terrible for the small business owners in the metro   community, and our state that was looking forward to hosting this game and had put a lot of resources into it. All because of a big lie."" Kemp signed the bill on March 25. The legislation places new restrictions on voting by mail, adds voter ID requirements and limits ballot drop boxes. It also mandates two Saturdays of early voting ahead of general elections, an increase from just one, and leaves two Sundays as optional. Lastly, it bans outside groups from handing out food or water to those waiting in line to vote.  Critics argue the Republican-sponsored legislation is an attempt to suppress   votes. Biden blasted the law,   in his  . ""This is Jim Crow in the 21st Century. It must end,"" he said in a March 23 statement. In   Friday, Abrams wrote that Republican   had defended the voting bill ""knowing the economic risks"" and "" prioritized making it harder for people of color to vote over the   well-being of all Georgians."" ""I am disappointed that the MLB is relocating the All-Star game; however I commend the players, owners and League commissioner for speaking out. I urge others in positions of leadership to do so as well,"" she said. ""As I have stated, I respect boycotts, although I don't want to see Georgia families hurt by lost events and jobs. Georgians targeted by voter suppression will be hurt as opportunities go to other states. We should not abandon the victims of GOP malice and lies -- we must stand together."" Abrams called on Georgia Republicans to ""renounce the terrible damage they have cause to [Georgia's] voting system"" and ""the harm they have inflicted on our economy.""  Mounting pressure, the statements from Biden and the support of activists such as Abrams led MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred to announce the move.  ""Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box,"" he said.  CEO Ed Bastian also called the law ""unacceptable,"" and   chief executive James Quincey said the legislation was a ""step backward."" However, Kemp argued -- echoing his Friday interview on   --  that the bill ""does not suppress anything"" and argued that the new law compares favorably to New York. ""We have 17 days of in-person early voting. New York has 10. This bill adds the opportunity for people potentially to vote on two optional Sundays, which would give potentially some counties 19 days,"" he told the ""Fox and Friends"" hosts. ""Are we boycotting them because they're in New York? No. This is just the cancel culture, and I will tell you, the people at home should be scared because their ballgame is next, their business will be next, their way of life will be next."" Kemp said Biden wasn't being truthful and that ""suppression"" was ""just a buzzword"" used to ""browbeat"" CEOs and corporate boardrooms.  ""None of them are citing specifics in the bill. If you'll notice, they're just saying, you know, 'This is a step backwards.' Or, you know, 'This is wrong.' Or whatever,"" he added. ""Like none of them are pointing to specifics in the bill because they know damn well their people were in the Capitol working with us on the bill. They knew what was in it and now their position has changed."" Kemp said he agreed with former  , who   that MLB’s leadership was ""afraid of the Radical Left Democrats."" ""Boycott baseball and all of the woke companies that are interfering with Free and Fair Elections. Are you listening Coke, Delta, and all!"" he said.  ""Well, I think the [former] president -- like me -- is very frustrated at this canceled culture,"" Kemp remarked, noting that the Atlanta Braves organization   and that ""even Democrats are coming out saying how wrong it is to move the game."" He said he would be ""glad"" to have a discussion with MLB about the issue -- a sentiment   -- but noted he believes the ""playbook for this"" was already ""written over a month ago"" because Democrats like Biden and Abrams thought it was ""going to be bad.""  ""But, you know, the end result was not because it went through the process. We worked with the House and the Senate with reasonable people, got things in there to provide even more access, but also just make sure that in Georgia it's easy to vote and hard to cheat. And, I guess they don't agree with that,"" he mused.  Kemp pointed out that the bill had been worked on for more than four or five months and ""none of these people"" had ""said anything."" ""The issues that they did say something about, you know at the end of the day, didn't end up in the bill which is how the process is supposed to work,"" Kemp said. ""It's just so sad for baseball fans that the league has now made baseball in the United States of America so political."" The governor believes the liberal push to pass  , also   is to blame. The legislation would require all states to offer mail-in ballots and automatic voter registration, among other things. ""This is a political play by the president and Stacey Abrams and a lot of other people that want HR1 one to pass,"" Kemp added. "
"Mazie Hirono rips Kavanaugh, other Trump Supreme Court picks, as she promotes new memoir",politics,https://www.foxnews.com//media/mazie-hirono-rips-kavanaugh-other-trump-supreme-court-picks-as-she-promotes-new-memoir,"U.S. Sen.   made a name for herself during  's   confirmation hearings three years ago. Now she's ripping the justice again -- describing him as a ""political operative"" and ""not a very good lawyer"" -- as she promotes her new memoir. Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat, said she thought the FBI conducted a ""sham"" investigation of accuser Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh, according to a New York Times article published last week. ""The sham FBI investigation was so limited in its scope that Dr. Blasey wasn’t questioned, and other people who could have corroborated the allegations were never questioned,"" she told the Times. The senator said Ford handled herself with ""such grace"" during her Senate testimony about her sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh before his confirmation. ""It was such a contrast to Kavanaugh, who is just a political operative,"" she said. ""In my view, he’s not a very good lawyer."" She also criticized Justice Neil Gorsuch, who, like Kavanaugh, was nominated by former  . She accused Gorsuch of making some ""really stupid decisions"" because he’s so ""literal"" about the law.

Hirono also defended her questioning of Supreme Court Justice  , nominated by Trump, which some have criticized as Hirono questioning Barrett's Roman Catholicism.

"Orgy, underage girls, sex games and extortion: Inside the allegations surrounding Rep. Matt Gaetz",politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/orgy-underage-girls-sex-games-and-extortion-inside-the-allegations-surrounding-rep-matt-gaetz,"Long before bombshell allegations of   rocked the political world this week, Rep.  's rumored sexual conduct was already a source of controversy.  When Gaetz was a young state lawmaker in the Florida House of Representatives, he allegedly participated in a competition with fellow male lawmakers to earn points for their sexual conquests, the   Friday. Having sex with married lawmakers and spending the night in a college sorority house earned the lawmakers extra points. And the ultimate prize was sleeping with one particular conservative woman, they dubbed the ""snitch,"" in a nod to the ""Harry Potter"" game of Quidditch, a Republican who worked with Gaetz in the 2010s revealed in an interview with the Insider.  The game was the ""worst kept secret in Tallahassee,"" the GOP insider said. The sex competition in Tallahassee has been alleged before by Chris Latvala, a Republican state representative. During a 2020 Twitter feud with his former colleague, Latvala said Gaetz ""created a game where members of the FL House got 'points' for sleeping with aides, interns, lobbyists, and married legislators."" Gaetz replied to Latvala at the time, ""just because I own you on twitter, don’t confuse me for your daddy when it comes to abusing power for sex."" That was a reference to Latvala’s father, Jack, who   in December 2017 amid sexual harassment allegations. Gaetz's past has come under renewed scrutiny this week amid a steady stream of damning headlines against the 38-year-old congressman -- a top ally to former President Donald Trump who rose to national prominence as a TV-ready surrogate for the president's causes.  Since a federal sex trafficking probe involving Gaetz was made public this week, more reports have surfaced about the conservative firebrand's conduct around women. In Congress, Gaetz would brag about his sexual escapades to his colleagues on the House floor and allegedly showed fellow lawmakers nude photos and videos of women he had slept with,   Thursday. One video Gaetz revealed to colleagues allegedly showed a naked woman with a hula hoop. In Tallahassee, where Gaetz served from 2010 to 2016, some women allegedly referred to the young lawmaker as ""Creepy Gaetz"" because they were made uncomfortable by him,   reported. Years ago, the   on the scoring system that young male lawmakers had used to rank women, but didn't name the lawmakers involved. There were special points given out in sexual conquests for ""virgins,"" a source told ABC News.  Gaetz was often seen trying to pick up young women at 101 Restaurant in Tallahassee, where students from nearby Florida State University would frequent, ABC News reported.  These past tales have emerged in recent days as Gaetz is faced with a federal criminal investigation that apparently started during the Trump Administration under former Attorney General William Barr. Despite the barrage of bad press --   on Friday -- Gaetz has remained defiant. ""I'm not resigning,"" Gaetz   on Friday. Gaetz has suggested an ex-Justice Department official leaked the criminal investigation to the New York Times because Gaetz and his family would  .  ""It is a horrible allegation and it is a lie. The New York Times is running a story that I have traveled with a 17-year-old woman and that is verifiably false. People can look at my travel records and see that that is not the case. What is happening is an extortion of me and my family,"" Gaetz   Tuesday night.  The wild extortion plot Gaetz alleges involves a $25 million payoff to help find missing ex-FBI agent Robert Levinson in Iran in exchange to help Gaetz get out of a federal probe involving a purported orgy with underage girls.  According to documents obtained and reported by the  , the alleged scheme revolves around attempts by former Air Force intelligence officer Bob Kent and Beggs & Lane attorney David McGee, a former federal prosecutor, to free Levinson. Levinson's family has presumed him to be dead.  Kent reportedly sought a $25 million loan to fund an operation to rescue Levinson, and promised to help the congressman with legal woes in return. The money was to be transferred into a trust account of law firm Beggs & Lane, bearing the name of McGee, the Levinson family attorney. Gaetz provided text message screenshots, an email, and a typed document to the Examiner to show the alleged extortion scheme that also involved his father, Don Gaetz, the wealthy former president of the Florida Senate. In a document labeled ""Project Homecoming"" that Kent purportedly gave Don Gaetz, it outlined the feds' alleged case against the congressman saying he's ""currently under investigation by the FBI for various public corruption and public integrity issues."" It says the FBI has learned of images of Gaetz in a ""sexual orgy with underage prostitutes."" The document says at least one underage girl has provided testimony to a Florida grand jury that Gaetz ""paid her to engage in sexual activities.""  If the Gaetz family paid the $25 million and Levinson is successfully freed from Iran, Gaetz would be on the plane that returns Levinson to freedom and be ""given credit"" for facilitating the release, the document said.  Gaetz told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that his family had notified the FBI about the alleged extortion, naming McGee as being behind it. Gaetz said his father had worn a wire during a meeting as part of an investigation of the extortion claim, and that he believes the Times story had been leaked in order to thwart that investigation. Reached Saturday, McGee called Gaetz's allegations false.  ""It’s silly. I didn’t try to extort anything from anybody,"" McGee told Fox News. ""I’m not going to go much beyond that."" McGee pointed to a statement his Pensacola law firm Beggs & Lane released that called Gaetz’s allegations "" .""  Federal investigators are reportedly determining whether Gaetz and another Republican paid underage girls for sex or offered them gifts in exchange for sex. The New York Times reported the   on Tuesday first revealing that the feds had zeroed in on whether Gaetz had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl and paid her to travel with him.  The Times and other outlets went on to report further details of the investigation that apparently started with Gaetz's political ally, Joel Greenberg. Greenberg is a former GOP Florida tax collector who was indicted last year and is facing a slew of charges, including sex trafficking of a child. The   that the investigation focuses on their alleged involvement with multiple women who were recruited online for sex and received cash payments. Greenberg, a former tax collector in Seminole County, Fla., allegedly met the women through websites that connect people who go on dates in exchange for gifts, fine dining, travel and allowances, The Times reported. The investigation is looking at whether Greenberg introduced the women to Gaetz and whether the congressman had sex with them, the newspaper reported. Federal prosecutors are reportedly focused on payments to the women through the mobile payment service Cash App. Gaetz purportedly came to federal investigators' attention after they learned he was spotted visiting a closed Seminole County Tax Collector’s Office on a weekend night with Greenberg back in 2018. Greenberg was there going through a basket of driver's licenses that were turned in by residents for disposal,  .  Feds allege Greenberg used fake IDs for individuals he was involved in ""sugar daddy relationships"" with and to engage in ""commercial sex acts,"" according to  . Greenberg has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.  Gaetz's office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment about the wave of new reports involving sex games, picture sharing and misconduct. But the congressman has repeatedly denied any criminal wrongdoing, including paying for sex and sleeping with underage women. He said he's been the victim of a federal extortion plot. ""Matt Gaetz has never paid for sex,"" Gaetz's office said in a  . ""Matt Gaetz refutes all the disgusting allegations completely. Matt Gaetz has never ever been on any such websites whatsoever. Matt Gaetz cherishes the relationships in his past and looks forward to marrying the love of his life."" Gaetz proposed to  , a 26-year-old food analyst, at Mar-a-lago in December 2020. The couple met at Trump's Florida club earlier that year.   "
Kamala Harris has gone 11 days without a news conference since being tapped for border crisis role,politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/kamala-harris-no-press-conference-border-crisis,"Vice President   was tasked last month with leading efforts to address migration to the  , where the nation is facing what's been described as a ""humanitarian crisis"" amid a surge in migrants coming to the U.S. Her assigned efforts on immigration, which include overseeing diplomatic efforts with Northern Triangle countries, fit into a broader trend of the administration delegating substantial foreign policy responsibilities to her. For example, she has held calls with major world leaders like Canadian Prime Minister   and Israel's  . Since the beginning of the administration and a week after Biden's announcement, Harris has fielded questions from the media but has yet to hold a formal news conference. Meanwhile, the border crisis captivated the nation's attention and raised a series of concerns about national security and the stability of the U.S. immigration system as a whole. When Biden initially announced her appointment, he said she would be in charge of working to return migrants to their home countries. ""So this new surge we're dealing with now started with the last administration, but it's our responsibility to deal with it humanely and to – and to stop what's happening,"" Biden said month. ""And so, this increase has been consequential, but the vice president has agreed – among the multiple other things that I have her leading – and I appreciate it – agreed to lead our diplomatic effort and work with those nations to accept re- – the returnees, and enhance migration enforcement at their borders – at their borders."" The White House later attempted to claim that Harris wasn't involved with the ""border crisis,"" but was instead focused on addressing the ""root causes – not the border."" Regardless, returnees include individuals who make contact with U.S. authorities at the southern border, as well as others who are returned while traveling through other countries. The overwhelming flow of migrants has led to the viral photos of individuals packed into close quarters despite coronavirus restrictions, raising questions about two of the Biden-Harris' campaigns central attacks on President Trump. During the campaign, Biden lambasted Trump for not taking COVID-19 seriously and assailed his purported cruelty in placing migrant children in cages. The border crisis itself encompasses a long list of issues and agencies througout the federal government, particularly those housed under the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services. According to Harris' office, she'll work closely with various Cabinet members, including the secretary of state and the administrator for international development, as well as the special envoy for the Northern Triangle. "
Study declares AOC one of the least effective members of Congress,politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/aoc-one-of-least-effective-members-congress,"She’s the queen of Twitter — but less successful at lawmaking. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., was among the least effective members of the last Congress, according to a new survey from the nonpartisan   — a joint project of Vanderbilt University and the University of Virginia. Ocasio-Cortez introduced a total of 21 bills that the center defined as ""substantive"" — but that is where the story ends. Her legislation received no action in committees, no floor votes, and none ever became law, according to the center, which takes its data from Congress.gov. ""She introduced a lot of bills, but she was not successful at having them receive any sort of action in committee or beyond committee and if they can’t get through committee they cannot pass the House,"" Alan Wiseman, a Vanderbilt political scientist and co-director of the center, told The Post. ""It’s clear that she was trying to get her legislative agenda moving and engage with the lawmaking process,"" Wiseman added. ""But she wasn’t as successful as some other members were — even among [other] freshmen — at getting people to pay attention to her legislation."" When looking at the legislative effectiveness of all congressional Democrats, AOC was ranked 230th out of 240 Democrats. Among the 19 Democratic lawmakers from New York, she ranked last. Among the bills that died at birth were a   of public housing, a   and a mandate to   to illegal immigrants. Democratic House insiders said many of Ocasio-Cortez’s colleagues found her approach alienating. ""Tweeting is easy, governing is hard. You need to have friends. You need to understand the committee process, you need to be willing to make sacrifices,"" said one. ""Her first day in Congress … she decided to  A second Democratic insider who worked with her in the New York delegation added that ""legislation was never her focus. It was media and narrative.""  Across the aisle, Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., told The Post, ""Her ludicrous policy ideas would destroy our country — Americans should be thankful she’s not effective."" As a current freshman, Malliotakis does not appear on the list. Represenatives for Ocasio-Cortez did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Post. Fellow Democratic socialist ""Squad"" members fared better than AOC. Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar sponsored 33 bills that also went nowhere, earning her 214th place, while Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib saw three of her substantive bills advance into committee — with one ultimately becoming law. She ranked 92nd. Things weren’t much better over in the Senate where New York Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand clocked in at 39 of 45 — with none of the substantive bills she proposed becoming law. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer landed at 33 — though Wiseman stressed that politicians in leadership positions often fared poorly, as their jobs required them to assist other members with their initiatives. It wasn’t all doom and gloom for the Empire State — which benefited from a large bench of lefty warhorses with clout in the chamber.  Westchester Rep. Nita Lowey, who retired last year after a 32-year career in Congress, was declared the House’s most successful Democrat in her final term, a ranking she snagged largely owing to her job as chair of the powerful Appropriations Committee. Of 29 major bills she introduced, seven ultimately became law. Ranking just behind her as the chamber’s third most-effective Democrat was Manhattan’s Carolyn Maloney.  Among Republicans, Syracuse’s John Katko was a major standout, with six of his substantive bills passing the House (none became law) despite his party being in the minority. He was the highest-rated New York Republican and ranked third overall among his colleagues. Tom Reed, a Republican from Corning, scored the lowest of state GOP lawmakers who completed a full term, but still placed a respectable 45th out of 205, with 11 substantive bills sponsored and one becoming law.  This story first appeared in the  ."

"Cuomo’s cheating on Sandra Lee was ‘an open secret,’ sources say",politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/cuomos-cheating-on-sandra-lee-was-an-open-secret-sources-say,"""SANDREW""  . The beautiful and warm TV cooking-show star softened the gruff, hard-charging governor’s sharp edges. Her telegenic smile seemed to transform his perpetual scowl. During their 14 years together Sandra Lee never publicly criticized her life partner, and   gushed about the ""godsend"" who helped him raise his three daughters. When she  , he was seen as a loving fixture by her side. In September 2019,   and a disbelieving public clamored to know why. Now, as a tornado of sexual-harassment charges swirls around Cuomo, the first clues may be emerging. Lee, ever composed, remains outwardly stoic and above the fray — even as multiple sources told The Post they suspect ­Cuomo was cheating on her with at least one staffer and possibly several. ""Sandra’s gone silent and her silence is deafening,"" said the insider. ""The question is, is Sandra being silent out of grace and dignity, or is she being silenced out of fear of retaliation?"" Lee did not comment. Cuomo told The Post: ""Any suggestion that I had a sexual relationship with any member of my staff or that I was unfaithful to Sandy is false."" Following the devastating breakup, Lee, 54,  . She refused to speak to The Post about her relationship with Cuomo, 63, or the ugly allegations that have led to a state investigation and calls for impeachment. Still, reports and investigations into whether Cuomo sexually harassed staffers in and around the workplace have raised questions about how his alleged behavior affected his last long-term relationship, and if his pursuit of other women could have contributed to the mysterious break-up. The Post also spoke to staffers who claimed that Lee was kept at arm’s-length while Cuomo spent time with favored colleagues around the clock. And the allegations from female staffers of improper flirting, touching and comments going back 21 years have raised questions about whether Cuomo was faithful during his relationship with Lee. ""Andrew is toxic. There’s obviously a reason why Sandra moved to California — she literally could not have moved farther away from Andrew. She’s on the edge of the Pacific,"" the insider added. A former senior Cuomo staffer said ominously: ""Andrew’s treatment of Sandra is part of the puzzle that will finalize the picture about this guy."" Sources told The Post how Cuomo threw boozy parties at the pool house in the governor’s mansion and ""movie nights"" attended by female staffers, all without Lee, who often traveled to the West Coast to care for her family. While it is possible that such events were innocent — if awkward — morale-building exercises for the many staffers (male and female) in attendance, these details form part of the pattern that emerged after former staffers spoke out about inappropriate behavior where lines between Cuomo’s personal and professional lives became blurred. Five former Cuomo staffers told The Post they are convinced he became involved, or pursued intimate relationships, with a small number of staffers while living with Lee. ""It was an open secret,"" said one ex-aide. ""Andrew was sleeping with at least one other woman who wasn’t Sandra"" before they officially ended their relationship. A second former staffer told how State Troopers who came to pick up Cuomo one morning at the home Cuomo and Lee shared in Mount Kisco, Westchester, were stunned to see him leave the house with a staffer. Asked if it was possible they had been working, the former staffer said it was doubtful: ""There was no reason for this woman to be there so early."" Cuomo, through a spokesman, denied any staffer ever spent the night at the Mount Kisco house, saying that occasionally staffers would meet him at the house in the morning so they could join his entourage for a ride to an event or meeting. Staffers also raised questions about Cuomo’s travel arrangements. When Cuomo traveled to Jerusalem in March 2017, a third former staffer claimed the governor and a female staffer were booked into linked, adjoining rooms. Although this could have been entirely innocent, the source said suspicions were raised when official logs were changed to show a State Police officer staying in the adjacent room.  Cuomo claims this was ac­cidental. ""On trips, as a rule, only State Police security or advance staff were assigned to adjoining rooms with the governor — when I saw that the hotel had made a room assignment not keeping with that rule, I switched rooms so that I was in the adjoining room and the other staff person was moved across the hall,"" said Steve Cannon, who was the lead advance person on March 2017 Israel trip. Cuomo denied any liaisons during the Israel trip, and his spokesman provided a busy travel itinerary that showed Cuomo had ­almost no free time. However, the document showed that he had a room at the King David Hotel, and a scheduling gap between a 7 p.m.   and his 12:45 a.m. flight home. Cuomo’s office claimed the extra time was spent with Israeli media. The Israel part of the weekly schedule — unlike other days of the week where every event or meeting appeared with a list of names of staffers present — fails to list any member of his ­entourage. ""There was no sleep over on this trip — according to our records, after meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the governor and the state delegation arrived back at the hotel around 8.15pm, the governor then had dinner with prominent media officials in the lobby before departing for the airport at 9.45pm,"" Azzopardi said. It wasn’t just geographical distance that may have pushed Lee and Cuomo apart. During the relationship, former staffers described how Cuomo would tell his office not to let Lee know where he was as he enjoyed drinks late at night at Docks, a seafood restaurant in the same building as the governor’s Midtown office, with senior female staff. After entering through a back door leading from the office building to a private room, Cuomo would hold court, according to the former staffers. The   accusing Cuomo   in social scenarios (which he largely denies) raises questions about whether any of these round-the-clock interactions led to romantic relationships. Cuomo is notoriously secretive about his life and tightly controls what is revealed about his personal and working relationships, as evidenced by his continuing use of a BlackBerry, sources said. Even though Cuomo’s office announced in November 2019 that staffers’ BlackBerrys were being phased out for iPhones, the governor still uses one. According to Politico, Cuomo preferred BlackBerry’s PIN-to-PIN messaging system to avoid paper trails. A former staffer told The Post: ""Andrew was extremely security-conscious; if he was doing anything, you would not be able to find it out."" Aside from the suspicion of romantic relationships, Cuomo also cultivated a ""mean girls"" atmosphere inside his office where he allowed his staff to make fun of Lee — and encouraged them to hide his calendar from her and prevent her from joining him at events. Former aide Ana Liss,   — who told The Wall Street Journal how the governor ""asked her if she had a boyfriend, called her sweetheart, touched her on her lower back at a reception and once kissed her hand when she rose from her desk"" — confirmed to The Post that Lee was deliberately kept away from Cuomo’s diary by staffers, including top current aide Melissa DeRosa and current Director of the Governor’s Offices Stephanie Benton. ""My understanding is that Sandra was viewed . . . as merely an accessory,"" she said. Cuomo’s office countered that ""the office e-mailed Sandra a schedule each night of the governor’s movements for the following day."" Liss continued, ""I know from my time working there that Sandra was very clearly kept away from Andrew by the folks controlling his schedule. She was only brought forth in public on certain special occasions. Given the lack of frequency of their time spent together publicly and privately, it had a performative nature about it. It felt like watching Princess Diana. She [Sandra] is a beautiful, statuesque woman who complemented the governor’s gruffness. ""She never stayed at the mansion that I was aware of,"" said Liss, who added that it ""did strike me as odd that he was rarely at home with her."" Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi said Lee did in fact spend time at the Albany mansion, just as Cuomo spent plenty of time   where Lee had made a home for them. Azzopardi added that Cuomo did not have a Manhattan apartment. ""It was Sandra’s forever home, her dream home,"" Liss said. ""But as a staff member for two years, I monitored Andrew’s schedule every day, to know what he was doing and focused on. He spent most of his time in Manhattan."" During scheduling calls, the ex-senior staffer recalled, ""I would ask whether Sandra was going on a trip with Andrew, and all the mean girls like   and [current Cuomo director of scheduling] Annabel Walsh would start laughing and say nothing. They would be rolling their eyes."" One of the last times ""that Sandra attended an event with Andrew was the Pride Parade in the city in June 2018. She loved coming and it was a really important event to her. ""And people from the office were hostile, they totally ignored her. She had her sunglasses on the whole time and looked so sad. ""Andrew humiliates people, one way or another.""  Walsh and Benton did not return messages seeking comment. The Governor’s Office denied Sandra was ill-treated by staff. ""Sandra was very much part of the family and the office has nothing but respect for her,"" Azzopardi said. Away from Lee, Cuomo threw pool bashes that Liss described as turning into nights of boozing, although Cuomo’s rep stresses that the governor does not drink. Speaking about the pool-house parties, the former senior staffer said: ""I attended them, You had to go — it was a sign you were senior in the administration."" Although the staffer never saw any sexual activity, she found the arrangement uncomfortable. ""They were so awkward, everyone standing around like court jesters, and Andrew would be watching you, he had a photographer there, even though it was ­basically an internal staff meeting — it was creepy beyond belief. ""And I’m certain that the same collection of people — his favorites — slept over there. Imagine how that looks to the rest of the office."" On one occasion, Cuomo invited four female staffers to a movie-night sleepover at the mansion, the ex-senior staffer said. Azzopardi said any informal gatherings at the governor’s mansion, whether inside watching movies or having a meal and drinks in the pool house, were family-friendly and co-ed and never resulted in guests staying the night. Despite the extracurricular activities and the pattern of questionable behavior at work alleged by no less than seven women, Cuomo was famously portrayed as the doting boyfriend when Lee was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015 and underwent a grueling double mastectomy. Privately, those who worked for him pondered whether he was merely using his partner’s illness as a publicity stunt. Cuomo even appeared wearing a mask and scrubs alongside Lee, who documented every aspect of her illness — from diagnosis to surgery and recovery — on camera for her HBO documentary ""Rx: Early Detection, A Cancer Journey with Sandra Lee."" ""After Sandy decided to make her breast-cancer diagnosis public, she and the governor vowed to fight for New York families together — it was a terribly painful time for the entire family and for someone to try to distort that is just wrong,"" said Azzopardi. In his 2014 book, "" ,"" Cuomo gushed about Lee, writing: ""Why she got involved with me I don’t know. I was not much of a catch. But Sandy was. Smart, successful and gorgeous, she had launched her flagship show, ‘Semi-Homemade Cooking with Sandra Lee,’ a few years earlier. She has enormous appeal to viewers and to readers of her books and magazine, who lead busy lives and to put good food on the table quickly. No marketing gimmick, her ‘smart and simple’ approach grew out of her hardscrabble beginnings: the eldest of five children, with an abusive mother and stepfather, Sandy had to shop and cook for the household and take care of her siblings — on welfare and food stamps — starting when she was 12 . . . more than a catch, Sandy was a godsend."" He also praised her for being ""an exquisitely kind, loving and nurturing person with an uncommon ability to connect with people. She was adept at taking care of three young girls as I was not. My children took to her immediately, and as they’ve grown older, she has been a significant presence in their lives. We have made a family."" Liss said of the cancer drama: ""By that time, I wasn’t working in the Governor’s Office, but those of us not there who were still in touch speculated that he was using it as a p.r. stunt, something to add to his credibility as a man and politician who is a proclaimed feminist — even though internally within the workplace that he oversaw he was very much not pro-woman."" An insider close to the couple observed of Cuomo’s workplace behavior: ""If someone acts this badly in the office 12 hours a day, how do they come home and turn into Mr. Wonderful unless they are Jekyll and Hyde?"" Cuomo’s latest accuser,  , said Cuomo forcibly kissed her cheeks and made her uncomfortable while examining flood damage at her home. Other accusations range from groping a woman under her shirt and planting unwanted kisses, to asking inappropriate questions about sex and dating. The Democratic governor has said he "" "" and ""never made any inappropriate advances,"" and that no one ever told him at the time that he was making them uncomfortable. He has called some allegations false   if his overly familiar behavior made anyone feel ­uncomfortable. Cuomo has also suggested that he was simply being an old-school politician in greeting people with hugs and kisses — and that ""sensitivities"" have changed. An investigation into the   is currently being led by attorneys Joon Kim, a former prosecutor with the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, and Anne Clark, an employment-discrimination attorney. The duo  , a Cuomo ally, to lead the probe. Lee and Cuomo first met in 2005 while guests at a cocktail party at the Hamptons home of Domna Stanton, a French professor at the City University of New York, and were introduced by one of Lee’s best friends, political adviser Alexandra Stanton, as Nancy Pelosi looked on. Though they were immediately smitten, they were each finalizing their respective divorces:  , the mother of his three daughters, and Lee to Bruce Karatz, the former CEO of KB Home. Karatz was 22 years Lee’s senior and in 2010 he was convicted of lying about the backdating of stock options at the LA-based homebuilder firm. Besides house arrest at his Bel Air mansion, Karatz was sentenced to five years’ probation, fined $1 million and ordered to do 2,000 hours of community service. Friends of Kerry Kennedy spoke of ""instances of physical abuse"" in the marriage before they divorced in 2005, according to an author who published a book on Cuomo. Michael Shnayerson, a journalist and contributing editor with Vanity Fair, claimed that Kennedy, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, slept in a locked bathroom several nights after Cuomo refused to leave the house when she told him she wanted a ­divorce. ""I’ve been a human-rights activist, and for women who have abusive husbands,"" Kennedy allegedly told a friend, ""and here I am enduring this abuse."" Shnayerson also claimed Cuomo tried to punish Kennedy after the divorce was announced by leaking stories to the press about how she had an affair with a ‘Republican polo player’ so that the public would blame her, and the split would not harm his political career. As a couple, Cuomo and Lee maintained a low-key profile. She didn’t campaign with him in his race for governor in 2010, and they appeared together only occasionally at official events. She explained their public shyness as a way of guarding their privacy. ""I have a partner,"" she told Harper’s Bazaar in 2011, ""who feels the exact same way as I do about protecting our personal relationship. ""More than anything now, I feel really lucky to have a relationship that’s just mine and that I get to go home to, that’s a safe haven, and that I have something that’s not the whole world’s, too,"" she said. Lee — who has no children of her own — cherishes her relationships with  , Mariah, Cara and Michaela Kennedy-Cuomo. Lee and the girls grew so close that she continues to refer to them as her ""weekend daughters."" They each had their own bedrooms at Lily Pond, the home Lee owned outright. ""I adore Andrew’s girls,""  . Lee and Cuomo never wed, but Lee dutifully threw herself into the role of political ""wife."" ""Sandra was reluctant to be New York’s first lady, but she did it and put her all into it and invested herself into New York philanthropy,"" the insider who knows the couple said. ""And over the years her All-American image helped soften his Prince of Darkness image statewide and on the national stage."" Recalling Cuomo’s relationship with Lee, Liss — who recently met with investigators from the state AG’s Office — said: ""Of the handful of interactions I had with Sandra, I thought that she was lovely. She always had her hands on the governor in such a way that I felt that she was enamored of him."" At home in California, Lee has spent the past year working on new TV projects and working alongside major networks, while traveling to Arizona to care for her beloved Uncle Bill, who has just battled COVID.  is filled with fans telling her they are glad she got out of her relationship with Cuomo and telling her to find new love. Ex-TV exec Rob Morhaim, who has known Lee for two decades, said Lee will weather this storm like she has all the others. ""Sandra’s a strong woman. Whatever she’s going through, I doubt you will ever see her sweat,"" he said."
Political cartoon of the day: Easter in Minnesota,politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/cartoons-slideshow,
"Tucker Carlson: MLB, Delta and Coca-Cola push Georgia and America down road to corporatocracy",politics,https://www.foxnews.com//opinion/tucker-carlson-georgia-election-law-mlb-all-star-game,"Good Friday is always a mixed-emotions sort of day, and this Good Friday was no different. Shortly after lunchtime on the East Coast, a   into   near  . One of the officers was killed, along with the suspect. Now, it's interesting: We don't know very much about this incident, but this is one high-profile murder that didn't somehow set off an avalanche of hysterical   attacks on an entire racial group. You didn't see stories about how all Black people are bad or "" ,"" and thank God. That stuff is poison, and all decent people hate it. Attacking entire races is evil, it's really hurting the country, and the people in power should stop doing it. Today, for once, they didn't do it. Thank God for small blessings. But that doesn't mean our leaders turned down the opportunity to leverage the tragedy. Ilhan Omar immediately called for gun control even though the assailant apparently didn't have a gun, just a knife. She's not a genius, as we've noted before. Then the usual experts told us we need even more barbed wire around the Capitol. It's too open to the public, they said. To keep our democracy safe, we must wall off voters from the leaders who supposedly represent them. Well, that's already happening across the country, both physically in the Green Zone-style barriers you suddenly see everywhere around government buildings, and also on a far deeper level, a level that can't be undone as quickly as a fence. In a democracy, the people rule. If voters want something done over time, it happens. That's what self-government is. But what do you call a system in which all the really important decisions are made by big companies without any reference at all to what voters want? Well, that is not democracy. It's corporatocracy, and it's starting to look a lot like what we have now. Here's the latest example: Major League Baseball announced Friday it's pulling two of the biggest events in sports, the All-Star Game and the MLB Draft, out of the state of Georgia. Why is Major League Baseball weighing in on this? Because voters in the state of Georgia made a decision that the Biden administration doesn't like. As with so many big corporations, Major League Baseball believes it now has veto power over the democratic process. By the way, they may be right. In the case of Georgia, the state passed a law to reduce voter fraud. That law requires voters to provide some form of ID before they cast a mail-in ballot. That ID can be a driver's license or free, state-provided ID. Georgia makes it pretty easy to prove who you are. There's nothing crazy about this law. In fact, it's hard to believe it wasn't already on the books in Georgia. It should have been, but when it was proposed, it sailed through the state house. Georgia's House of Representatives approved this bill by a 25-vote margin, the state Senate by a vote of 34 to 24. So unlike, say, Obamacare, it wasn't a squeaker, and you can see why the overwhelming majority of Americans agree with it. They support mandatory photo ID for voting. According to a recent poll by the AP, fully 72% of people in this country believe that required IDs are a good idea. Why wouldn't they think that? You already have to show an ID when you fly in a plane or drive a car, open a checking account, hold a job or live in an apartment or get a vaccine, but you don't need one to vote. It's worse than ridiculous; it's sinister. Anyone who opposes voter ID laws is encouraging voter fraud, which is to say, encouraging the destruction of democracy. It's that simple. You can now put Major League Baseball in that category. Baseball was supposed to be America's pastime; happy, unifying, fundamentally nonpolitical, so it's strange to see this happen. How do we get here? It's not at all complicated. We have a new president now, and that president is willing to destroy even something as wholesome as the country's traditional game purely to increase the power of his political party. Just the other day, Joe Biden went on ESPN to demand that professional sports franchises boycott any state whose voters step out of line. In the considered judgment of the president of the United States, Georgia's voter ID law is Jim Crow on steroids. Asking people to show their identity before they vote is worse than segregation and lynching. It's Bull Connor and firehoses and snarling German shepherds ""on steroids."" You've got to wonder how long our leaders can keep saying reckless things like this before they really cause this society to fall apart. Joe Biden seems determined to find out. One thing Biden doesn't seem very interested in is his own home state of Delaware. Unlike Georgia, Delaware has never permitted mass early voting. Apparently, Delaware is a White supremacist state. About 80% of Georgia voters cast their ballots early last fall. In Delaware, that number was 29%. Why isn't that voter suppression? Why isn't it racism? Well, because Delaware is a one-party state controlled by the Democrats. It's working for them. They're not going to change it. Georgia, by contrast, is a swing state. So in the estimation of Joe Biden, it is worth using racially divisive lies to win it for his party permanently. According to Joe Biden, the real problem with Georgia's new election law is that it could cause dangerous dehydration.  Every word of the above was false. Maybe The Washington Post will  . (Just kidding.) In fact, the Georgia law bans political organizations from bringing gifts to people who are standing in line to vote. That's called electioneering, and it's banned in an awful lot of places, including in all probability where you live. But there is no prohibition, in Georgia or anywhere else, against people getting water and food in line if it comes from someone other than a political operative -- a friend or family member, for example. By the way,  . Hydrating is still legal in Georgia. As for the claim that this law will end voting at five o'clock, that's a lie, too. Where did Biden get the idea of voting ending at five o'clock? Well, it turns out that the big paper in Atlanta, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, reported that the law would ban voting after five o'clock. Their reporters apparently hadn't read the law. The paper had to   to their piece, effectively admitting they were repeating talking points without doing any research, (which is indeed what they were doing here). ""A previous version of this story said the new law would limit voting hours on Election Day. In Georgia, polling places are open from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., and if you are in line by 7:00 p.m., you are allowed to cast your ballot. Nothing in the new law changes those rules."" That's the truth finally appended to a lie. Joe Biden got his research on that bill from reporters who did no research. See how that works? At Friday's White House press briefing, one reporter asked an interesting question: Why is Joe Biden on television demanding a boycott of an American state while not demanding a boycott of China? After all, the Biden administration just declared that China was committing genocide against ethnic minorities. Joe Biden's grumpy little flack wasn't happy about that question. ""I'm not going to answer the questions and pretend that I already did, and you didn't hear it because you're dumb."" The truth is, there's no answer. No one at the White House explained why a law against voter fraud in Georgia justifies a boycott, but a genocide in China does not. It doesn't matter, the domestic boycott against Georgia grows anyway. Huge parts of corporate America have joined it. They've decided that Georgia is reinstating Jim Crow. Here's a great one: Coca-Cola, which is based in Atlanta, now tells us that Georgia's anti voter fraud law is unacceptable. [00:09:41][28.2] It's not clear how long the CEO of Coca-Cola has been in this country, but just to restate: Just because you run a soft drink company doesn't mean you get to control our democracy. So Coca-Cola is very, very concerned about Black people, which makes you wonder, since we're on the subject, how many Black people have died in the last hundred years from diabetes caused by Coca-Cola products? We don't have those numbers. Someone ought to find out. We bet money it's far more than the Minneapolis Police Department has killed, ever. Here's the even funnier part: China is one of Coca Cola's biggest markets. That's why last year, Curt Ferguson -- the president of Coca-Cola Greater China and Korea, went out of his way to praise the Communist Party of China for unleashing the coronavirus on the world. ""Thank you very much to the government with your quick, decisive actions, Ferguson said. ""Once again, thank you. You've really controlled a worldwide epidemic and should be very much congratulated for all your hard work."" ""May I kiss your feet? I slobber on you! Have a Coke and a smile!"" Unbelievable. But Coca-Cola wants you to believe that whatever's happening in China, it really cares most about its Type 2 diabetes victims here in the United States. If Coca-Cola hates discrimination, why isn't Coca-Cola saying anything about Phil Scott? He's the governor of Vermont (a Republican, by the way).  This week, Gov. Scott declared that Vermont would be passing out vaccines on the basis of skin color. Vermont wants to check your racial purity before they give you life-saving medicine. That doesn't seem like a good idea or legal or ethical or something that would ever happen in America. Is Coca-Cola OK with that? Apparently they are. You can still get a Diet Coke at Leunig's in Burlington. (Great restaurant, by the way.) Coke hasn't said a word about it. Neither has Delta, which, despite being an airline and not a super PAC, has also decided to condemn Georgia's elections bill. According to the CEO of Delta, people in the Black community are upset about the law so, of course, Delta is very upset, too. Obviously Ed Bastian's reading something the PR department wrote for him, but it doesn't seem like he's paused to think through the implications here. Delta Airlines operates because U.S. taxpayers and lawmakers -- our democracy -- allowed Delta to get to start an airline and run it. Part of the deal is, if you're Delta Airlines or some other big company benefiting from all the good things that America offers us, you're not allowed to override the democracy just because you're rich. You're not allowed to do that. And if you do, maybe we should punish you. Delta says its ""very large Black employee base is almost universally hurt by the law. Amazingly, that's not what Delta was saying about the very same law a few days ago before the Biden administration leaned on them. At the time, Delta issued a statement declaring: ""The legislation improved considerably during the legislative process and expands weekend voting, codifies Sunday voting and protects a voter's ability to cast an absentee ballot without offering a reason."" Delta, even at the time, praised the law's protections for ballot drop boxes: ""For the first time, drop boxes have also been authorized for all counties statewide, and poll workers will be allowed to work across county lines."" Before we even get into how Delta changed their views, we must point out that   Why are they weighing in on the voting? Who do you think you are, Delta Airlines?  Now, politics aside, the law doesn't meet its standards. Requiring voter ID, says Delta, is Jim Crow. But wait a minute, you might be wondering, doesn't Delta Airlines require photo ID in order to board its planes? Oh, that sounds like Jim Crow. Why isn't that racist? Because it's not, now shut up. One of the Democratic Party's top election law enforcers, a trollish man called Mark Elias, tried to answer that question on Twitter. ""The new Georgia law will require voters to submit ID to vote by mail,"" he wrote. ""If they use their driver's license, they need to provide the number. One of the two numbers below is correct. If they put the other down, it will be rejected. Are you sure you would pick the right one?"" Elias posted a photograph of a sample driver's license below his tweet, and the implication is pretty clear. According to Marc Elias, Black people can't find their driver's license number even when it's clearly identified on the driver's license card. Marc Elias, like Delta, just doesn't think they can read it. So who's the racist in the story? Seriously, when you treat adults like children, what does that say about how you feel about them? CNN is here to assure you that it's not the one who think black people can’t navigate a driver’s license. It's the people who are trying to reduce voter fraud. Those people, CNN reported, are essentially recruiting for the Klan. CNN literally went to its archives to find footage of minstrel shows, just in case the point wasn’t clear enough. Has propaganda ever been this heavy-handed? The North Koreans have a lighter touch. Next, CNN will be denouncing Republicans in Georgia as kulaks, and running dog lackey Trotskyist wreckers. That’s coming."
Coinstar fixes Georgia man's oily penny paycheck problem,politics,https://www.foxnews.com//us/coinstar-fixes-georgia-mans-oily-penny-paycheck-problem,"A   man that was shocked to find the amount of his final paycheck in the form of   dumped in his driveway last month is getting some help from coin-counting company Coinstar.  Fayetteville's Andreas Flaten had quit his   at Peachtree City's A OK Walker Luxury   in November and was having some trouble getting his last paycheck from his former employer. Although he had reportedly been promised his   would be paid to him in January, the check never arrived and Flaten said his former boss accused him of  . Flaten, who had gone so far as to call Georgia's Department of Labor for assistance, was surprised when he discovered more than 91,000   in front of his house.  An envelope resting on top of the pile contained his final pay stub and was addressed with an explicit message: ""F--- you!"" Since then, Flaten has spent nights cleaning the pennies, which   said sat in a wheelbarrow in his garage.  Flaten and his girlfriend had previously refused to comment to Fox News, saying they were focusing on getting a ""real payment"" for Flaten's final check. Coinstar took up the mantle and picked up the more than 500 pounds of pennies from Flaten on Thursday. The company pointed Fox News   in which it wrote that it also rounded up Flaten's paycheck to $1,000.  ""When we heard about Mr. Flaten’s penny problem, we were happy to offer our assistance,"" said Coinstar CEO Jim Gaherity. ""Coinstar has been in the coin business for 30 years and we process approximately 41 billion coins annually – so picking up 91,000 pennies was all in a day’s work."" ""I was spending an hour or two a night trying to clean the pennies and probably only cleaned off about $5 worth,"" Flaten told Coinstar. ""I was so relieved and grateful that Coinstar agreed to help me."" In addition, company executives announced that they would match Flaten's penny value and donate $1,000 to local charities of his choosing. Flaten named two     to receive the donations. ""I gave the money to Royal Animal Refuge and TLC Pet Rescue. One saved my dog and one saved my mother's dog,"" Flaten told Fox News in an email on Friday. Now that his nights are free, he plans on spending time with his family. "

"Biden reversing Trump policy, quietly ramping up Palestinian aid",politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/biden-reversing-trump-policy-ramping-palestinian-aid,"The Biden administration is quietly ramping up its financial assistance to Palestinians, in the latest reversal of former President Donald Trump’s foreign policy. The State Department, along with the US Agency for International Development, notified Congress of their intent to deliver nearly $75 million in aid to the region just one day after announcing a $15 million commitment publicly to vulnerable Palestinian groups. The State Department declined to say whether the $15 million was included in the $75 million mentioned to Congress, or if the two were separate payments. The funds do not require further Congressional approval, as they were largely appropriated in the 2020 fiscal year budget. They weren’t spent prior to President Biden taking office, however, because of the Trump administration policy blocking nearly all aid to Palestinians. Then-President Trump severed ties with the Palestinian Authority in August 2018, amid heightened tensions over the then-commander-in-chief’s decision to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The decision to block aid resulted in the Palestinians losing out on over $200 million. The Biden administration did not go out of it’s way to publicize the payment renewals, likely an effort to not cause concern among pro-Israel Americans over his Middle East positions. Reached for comment, State Department spokesman Ned Price reiterated the Biden administration’s support for resuming aid to the Palestinians. ""We continue to believe that American support for the Palestinian people, including financial support, it is consistent with our values. It is consistent with our interests. Of course, it is consistent with the interests of the Palestinian people,"" Price told reporters. ""It’s also consistent with the interests of our partner, Israel, and we’ll have more to say on that going forward,"" he continued. While Biden may not support the Trump doctrine on all aspects of foreign policy, he has welcomed one effort by the previous president: the Abraham Accords. The Abraham Accords were signed in September of last year, normalizing relations between Israel and two Gulf countries in a deal spearheaded by the Trump administration. Biden pledged at the time   of his predecessor, praising the diplomatic achievements that brought together Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Israel. This story first appeared in the New York Post."

And big. And controversial.  and congressional  are prepping trillions of dollars in new spending for a sweeping infrastructure plan. While proponents hail the proposal as a bold investment in the future, detractors call it a costly cousin of the Green New Deal. One portion of the plan is called the THRIVE Act. It stands for ""Transform, Heal and Renew by Investing in a Vibrant Economy."" """"The THRIVE agenda will invest $1 trillion a year over the next 10 years. So $4 trillion spent over the first term of the  "" said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. That level of spending alarms many  -- after Congress has forked out a whopping $6 trillion in pandemic response and relief over the past 13 months. ""Even after what we did last year, our national debt became the size of our economy, which hasn’t happened since World War II,"" said  , R-Ky. The Democratic plan goes far beyond conventional infrastructure, such as fixing or replacing deteriorating bridges and highways, taking climate change and other impacts into account. ""You can’t separate the climate part from this vision because every road we fix, every bridge we build, we can either do it in a way that’s better for the climate or worse for the climate,"" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN. ""Why wouldn’t we want to be creating these jobs in a way that’s better for the climate?"" The Democrats’ plan also intends to address social inequities. ""If you can’t have clean water, then you can’t be free. If you don’t have access to clean air, then you can’t be free. If you don’t have a community to live in that is sustainable, then you’re not going to be free. If you don’t have a dignified job. If you don’t have basic health care,"" said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif. Ed Markey says the plan will ""fight systemic racism"" and ""protect public health."" But Republicans frame the bill as something else. ""This is a Biden and Nancy Pelosi wish list of liberal, leftist agenda items. This is the Green New Deal. This is universal health care, all wrapped up into one, at the expense of you and I,"" said Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., on Fox News. Republicans accuse Democrats of attempting to advance liberal policy goals under the guise of a typically bipartisan infrastructure bill. ""It is a Trojan horse, designed to get all kinds of progressive, left-leaning agenda items moved through Congress under the auspices of new roads and bridges,"" protested former   chief of staff Mark Meadows on Fox Business. Biden has clearly stated that the bill would raise taxes for large coporations and the wealthy. ""The responsible thing to do is to propose a way to pay for that, over time,"" said  . ""He also believes that there's more that can be done to make the corporate tax code fair."" Under the proposal, the corporate tax rate would likely jump from 21 percent to 28 percent, raising an estimated $700 billion. Tax cuts enacted under former President Donald Trump would be wiped out, and the top individual rate of nearly 40 percent for those earning more than $400,000 a year would be restored. ""The goal [of Democrats] is to bring the resources into the government’s control,"" said one critic, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, American Action Forum president and former congressional budget director. ""We’re not letting households figure out whether to save for retirement or take a vacation."" Holtz-Eakin argues the Democrats’ tactic disburses money into ""the hands of first, the elected officials, and then the agencies, to determine what it does in the economy."" Democrats support the tax code reforms as long overdue.  ""Infrastructure pays for itself,"" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., co-chair of the Progressive Caucus. ""... But the goal is to make the tax system fair and just."" A long, drawn-out slog on a massive infrastructure bill could reveal Democratic fissures – especially when dealing with narrow majorities in the House and Senate. Democrats can only pass the bill it if they stay together, but there are already signs of trouble with moderates on one end and progressives on the other. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., for instance, demanded an even more sweeping infrastructure bill at a town hall meeting this week. Passing the infrastructure bill will be a grind. There was initial talk about bringing it to a vote before Memorial Day. Now July 4 is on the radar. A more realistic estimate is seven to eight months. Pelosi has refused to give a timeline, saying this week that she would advance the package when it’s ""ready.""  The bill is perhaps the biggest congressional lift since FDR’s New Deal programs of the 1930s. Democrats can only spare three votes on their side and still pass the bill without GOP assistance in the House. The Senate is split 50/50, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting any deciding votes. Getting Democrats to stick together is going to be a heavy lift. Reps. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., are already pushing for a restoration of the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT). The Trump tax law capped those deductions in high-tax states. ""New York and New Jersey are the largest net donors to the federal government and annually contribute more than we receive,"" the lawmakers said in a statement. ""Therefore, we will not accept any changes to the tax code that does not restore the SALT reduction and put fairness back into the system."" The task facing Democrats is reminiscent of Obamacare in 2009 and 2010. The mechanics in the committees began in the spring of 2009. The House approved the first version of the bill in November 2009; the Senate on Dec. 24. The House and Senate didn’t pass the final, unified version of the bill until March 2010. This time, Democrats could be encountering legislative fatigue. They have cranked out six major bills to address the pandemic, culminating in the $1.9 trillion relief package a month ago.  Here’s the problem for Democrats: They could face internal opposition from moderates if the bill is too big. If they jettison progressive policies, they lose liberals. The potential solution is to scale the package down to old-fashioned infrastructure and garner bipartisan support. burned his political capital too early in his term for a health care bill.   nearly did the same thing, passing a stimulus package early in his term. Lawmakers were already reeling from approving the TARP bill to rescue the economy in the fall of 2008. That’s why passage of Obamacare was such an epic lift. Even FDR experienced problems advancing the New Deal. Many of his loyalists in Congress bailed on other initiatives in the late 1930s. ""Presidents have only a limited amount of political capital. Typically, they can do one, two, or maybe three things if they’re lucky. People start getting tired, especially when you’re spending a lot of money,"" said Darrell West of the Brookings Institution. ""Members [of Congress] can only take on a small number of tough votes. They might be willing to do the first one and the second one. But eventually it catches up with them."""
TikTok user takes issue with luxury NYC skyscraper in viral videos: 'Worst building in the world',lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//real-estate/tiktok-user-takes-issue-luxury-nyc-skyscraper-viral-videos,"Another day, another TikTok  A fast-talking teen is building a following the video platform for  , most notably voicing disdain for a dramatic skyscraper in New York City she’s christened the ""worst building in the world."" Last month, 16-year-old Louisa Whitmore from Canada took to TikTok to voice her frustrations with 432 Park Ave. in Manhattan. Whitmore’s first two critical clips ono the 96-floor residential skyscraper of luxury condos overlooking Central Park have since racked up a combined 3.3 million views. To date, she’s self-produced about 15 videos on the building and drawn a following of nearly 230,000. ""For the past three years, I’ve had this specific, firmly held belief in my mind that this building, 432 Park Ave. in New York City, is the worst building in the world,"" she said in the  . Acknowledging that the opinion was purely personal, the TikToker said she felt ""so vindicated"" that life in the high-rise might be less than luxurious, referencing a   report alleging issues with maintenance and management at the exclusive address. ""Residents of the exclusive tower are now at odds with the developers, and each other, making clear that even multimillion-dollar price tags do not guarantee problem-free living,"" the outlet claimed. ""The claims include millions of dollars of water damage from plumbing and mechanical issues; frequent elevator malfunctions; and walls that creak like the galley of a ship."" Delighting in the drama, Whitmore said that ""73% of mechanical, electrical and plumbing components were not up to the design, and almost a quarter of them presented an actual threat to their lives!""

But her alleged victims weren’t the only ones getting faked out — so were Bravo fans. The 47-year-old breakout star quickly became notorious for her flamboyant fashions and her friendship faux pas — both equally loud — on Season 1 of the latest entry in the ""Real Housewives"" franchise. However, the $3.9 million Salt Lake City rental she grandly passed off as the ""SHAH SKI CHALET"" actually never belonged to Shah, The Post has learned.  Instead the 9,420-square-foot home featured on the show is owned by the Texas-based real-estate rental company, Univesco Inc., which is under the limited liability company RJW Capital Investors.  Yes, it was (GASP!) a rental: Property records discovered by The Post reveal Univesco Inc. has owned the home since 2014. And as any true fan knows, in the ""Real Housewives"" universe, few things are more shameful than renting your own home. After all,  once   those who choose to rent. ""I don’t understand the concept of renting at all,"" the ""Real Housewives"" executive producer, 52,   in 2019. ""It’s just throwing money away. Especially a huge home. I don’t get it."" Steven Frey of Univesco told The Post she had no idea that Shah had been hyping the property as her own on the show. A separate spokesperson handling their Utah properties exclusively is expected to provide more details at a later time. Bravo itself may have also been deceived, considering they did not shy away from promoting the chalet on the show, including a  (Reps for the network declined to comment to The Post, but insiders told The Post they were well aware of the rental status.) ""On the November 11 series premiere … Jen Shah hosted a lavish fete at her house, but even before she transformed the abode (which she calls the ""Shah Ski Chalet"") for her castmate Meredith Marks’ birthday, our jaws dropped over her insanely gorgeous home,"" the article gushed. Although it went largely unnoticed at the time, speculation that one of the housewives from the show was renting a property to film   and podcasts. But there was even gossip in the housewives’ inner circle: On a Feb. 12, 2020 episode of  hosted by ""Real Housewives of Dallas"" star Brandi Redmond and Stephanie Hollman, Redmond revealed that she knew someone from the ""RHOSLC"" was renting. ""I do know that one of those ladies is renting a house,"" ginger-maned Redmond teased ominously. ""I don’t know [who it is] because I don’t know the cast but I do know that one of them is a renter because they’re renting some friends of mine’s home."" Shah reacted in her signature over-the-top style to Redmond’s comments on Instagram — after a helpful fan page shared an audio clip of her comments. ""Is this what everyone is getting their g-string up their a** about bcuz [sic] their irrelevant? Or is it bcuz they wish they could afford to pay the rent plus own 4 other homes and have an apt in NYC?"" Shah wrote in the comment section of a now-deleted Instagram post at the time. In a later post she continued to wax poetic: ""You want to come for me with your red hair and bulls–t, come harder honey. You’re about to get a taste of SHAH SQUAD and I don’t mess around. PERIODT."" Note: The Post could find no documentation to substantiate Shah’s claims of owning four other properties and an apartment in NYC. However, the sprawling chalet home featured on Bravo was up for sale in 2019, until the five-bedroom, six-bathroom spread was taken off-market — apparently during the time Shah began filming for the show, according to documents. According to the listing, the timber frame home is equipped with ""three substantial master suites, each with its own fireplace and sitting area, and two additional bedroom suites."" However, off of reality TV, and in actual reality, Shah’s longtime home is located in Sandy, Utah, which she owned with her husband, Sharrieff Shah, from 2004 until she sold it at a loss in June 2020. They initially purchased the home for only $302,069. It sold for $213,000.   Currently, records indicate that Shah and her husband are renting an approximately $8,000/month Park City space — which sorta resembles a mini-me of her TV home — that they moved into shortly after selling their 16-year home.  Shah and her   assistant Stuart Smith, 43, were arrested by the feds on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted, they face up to 30 years in prison.  ""Shah and Smith flaunted their lavish lifestyle to the public as a symbol of their ‘success,’"" said Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Peter Fitzhugh in a statement. ""In reality, they allegedly built their opulent lifestyle at the expense of vulnerable, often elderly, working-class people."" The indictment out of the Southern District of New York claims Shah and Smith executed a telemarketing scheme with co-conspirators that operated in five states — New York, New Jersey, Arizona, Nevada and Utah. A rep for Shah declined to comment on her arrest. According to the indictment, hundreds of victims, many of whom were over 55, were tricked into investing in shady projects and business services which included coaching sessions, tax preparation and website design services.  What’s worse, many of the individuals targeted did not own a computer.  The alleged scheme took place from 2012 up until as recently as this month.  ""At no point did the defendants intend that the victims would actually earn any of the promised return on their intended investment, nor did the victims actually earn any such returns,"" the indictment states. Her on-set debacle is a far cry from January, when Shah  , announcing she was launching a program dubbed ""Social Commerce,"" to assist women in need amid the  . ""We’re helping women pivot and shift their business through the quarantine and COVID,"" she explained at the time. ""To helping them still stabilize their business through online sales because their brick and mortar stores are closed… We’ve been working with some ladies, so you’ll see some of that coming out and hearing their stories and seeing how we help their businesses grow."" Perhaps she should have taken her own advice."
"Judge grants restraining order on Lil Nas X collaborated 'Satan Shoes,' puts end to planned giveaway",lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//lifestyle/judge-grants-restraining-order-lil-nas-x-satan-shoes-ends-planned-giveaway,"Apparently you can tell   something, at least when it comes to his ""Satan Shoes."" U.S. District Court Judge Eric Komitee granted   a temporary restraining order on Wednesday.  It is meant to stop American art collective MSCHF Product Studio from   ""Satan Shoes"" that use Nike Air Max 97 as a base, according to court documents obtained by  . The controversial   were a collaboration with the 21-year-old rapper, which MSCHF and Lil Nas X promoted on Monday, March 29, via  . MSCHF modified the shoes with prints that read ""1/666"" and ""Luke 10:18"" along with a gold pentagram and a liquid-swishing sole that reportedly contains a single drop of human blood. The company quickly sold out of the 666 pairs it made for $1,018 each. Nike filed a four-part complaint against MSCHF on Monday, including trademark infringement, false designation of origin and unfair competition, trademark dilution and common law trademark infringement and unfair competition. Lil Nas X is not named a defendant in the lawsuit, according to documents uploaded by  . In a statement sent to Fox News on Thursday, MSCHF asserted the Satan Shoes were created as an artistic commentary much like the holy water-filled Jesus Shoes it debuted in 2019. ""Over a year ago we released the Jesus Shoes. As a manifested speculative artwork Jesus Shoes conflates celebrity collab culture and brand worship with religious worship into a limited edition line of art objects,"" MSCHF’s statement reads. ""Last week’s release of the Satan Shoes, in collaboration with Lil Nas X, was no different. Satan Shoes started a conversation, while also living natively in its space. It is art created for people to observe, speculate on, purchase, and own. Heresy only exists in relation to doctrine: who is Nike to censor one but not the other?"" Lawyers for Nike reportedly argued that MSCHF’s Satan Shoes are damaging to the sneaker giants brand and have caused confusion among customers who believe it is an original Nike creation, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Meanwhile, a lawyer for MSCHF   on Wednesday that opposed Nike’s application for a temporary restraining order. The art collective argues that it made it clear the Satan Shoes were a collaboration with Lil Nas X and not with Nike, according to defense attorney Megan K. Kannigan. ""There is not imminent or immediate threat of irreparable harm related to the Satan Shoes,"" the letter reads before explaining, ""all but one pair of the shoes already have been sold and shipped."" The final shoe was being held for a giveaway but MSCHF is reportedly holding off due to the current litigation. MSCHF will not be producing additional Satan Shoes, the letter explains. Representatives for Lil Nas X and Nike did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment. The release of MSCHF’s Satan Shoes coincide with Lil Nas X’s music video ""Montero (Call Me By Your Name),"" which debuted Friday and shows the rapper dancing with the devil and taking his crown. In an explanation video Lil Nas X provided to  , the young artist said ""Montero"" is partly about his attraction to a man and the dark temptations that are in Hollywood. Lil Nas X’s latest song comes two years after the success of his   ""Old Town Road."""

The 21-year-old uploaded a new   on the platform Thursday taking full responsibility for flirting or sexting (sexually explicit texting) with minors. ""I was being reckless,"" he said, confirming that at least two interactions with minors took place. ""These conversations should have never happened.""  He explained how he added both minors on Snapchat and ""asked how old they were right away, was told that they were 18, believed them, engaged in flirty conversation and then, later on, found out that they were 16."" Charles said he's ""embarrassed"" and when the truth came out about their age, he ""blocked both people."" ""I needed to take accountability for my actions and more importantly apologize to the people that were affected by them,"" the Internet personality said.  In March, multiple minors came forward on social media and shared screenshots of their alleged conversations with Charles. Some claimed he asked them for nude photographs and/or sent them explicit photos and messages.  The beauty guru, who has over 25 million YouTube subscribers, admitted he believed the individuals were older. ""I trusted the information that was given to me rather than the information I could have and should have gotten myself,"" Charles said. ""As I did more research on this topic and self-reflected, I realized that the receipts and the screenshots and the specific details of the interaction don't matter, because I f---ed up and I need to take accountability for my actions and apologize to the people who were affected by them."" The makeup artist added how he's now understanding the unbalanced power dynamic between a celebrity and a fan. ""A power imbalance can happen even when it's not intentional,"" he reasoned. ""What I wasn't getting before is that the excitement that comes with talking to a celebrity is literally enough to make somebody do or say something they normally wouldn't. Even if that celebrity isn't even intentionally weaponizing their fame, money or power. That's a concept I just wasn't getting, but I now do.""  Charles concluded his video by announcing he's going to take a break from social media to ""further reflect and educate myself on these topics."""
"Delaware State Trooper surprises boy, 9, with new basketball sneakers after striking up friendship on court",lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//lifestyle/delaware-state-trooper-surprises-boy-basketball-sneakers," An adorable boy in   took shot at making a friend – and scored. When   Trooper Joshua Morris was out in Wilmington last week, he didn’t hesitate to shoot some hoops with local kids who asked him to join some pickup basketball,   reports. One of the youngsters, Ra’kir Allen, acted as the cameraman, commentator and cheerleader for the officer, who played in uniform. ""YAY!"" Allen screamed with glee in a now-viral  , as Morris scored a shot. The nine-year-old hollered, laughed and followed the state trooper’s every move as he showed off his game at the park. ""Oh that's Curry, that’s Curry, that's Curry!"" Allen cheered as the officer made a jump shot, and the two shared a high-five. ""His charisma, his character...I just loved,"" Morris told   of the pure-hearted kid. ""That reeks through his pores. I loved it."" Because Allen kept comparing him to Steph Curry of the NBA, Morris was inspired to treat the boy to a new pair of basketball kicks from the Golden State Warriors player’s Under Armour line. The state trooper got in touch with the fourth grader's mom, Elveria Griffin, to coordinate the sweet surprise, which was also caught on camera. ""My video is going viral because of you, you know that right? You is the man, everybody is talking about how you is the man, the best hype man ever,"" Morris told Allen in the heartwarming video that hit Instagram on Sunday. ""So I wanted to gift you with something. Do you remember what you said when I hit the jump shot and turned around? Curry, right?"" ""Since you was my hype man, I’m going to be your hype man right now,"" Morris said, opening his patrol car and taking out the shoebox. ""A fresh pair of Curry’s!"" Allen’s jaw dropped, and the trooper laughed, directing him to look in the left shoe. ""Is Curry in there?"" the boy joked – and found $50 in cash. ""I appreciate you, man, for you being the best hype man ever,"" Morris said, and Allen gave him a hug.   ""Anytime you see me, it’s all love,"" Morris explained. ""I always got your back, no matter what."" ""When we play on the basketball together that’s a common ground you and I can meet on so we can build these relationships. That breaks that barrier, so we can be friends, so from here we grow, we build a relationship,"" he added. Griffin told WPVI it was ""beautiful"" to see her son’s reaction to the generous gesture from his new friend. Law enforcement should never be strangers in the communities they serve, Morris stressed. Now, he hopes the kicks remind Allen he’s made a forever friend. ""When he laces up those sneakers, he has somebody who believes in him. He has somebody who loves him. He has somebody that will be kind to him,"" he said. Even Curry himself chimed in on the  , writing ""That how you do it to right there."""

""In my 50s, I still think I look pretty good in lingerie, but the reaction is reviled, obviously not by everybody, but yeah, there's a fair amount of backlash."" Porizkova added that the public's general consensus is that women nearing middle age shouldn't expose skin. ""I think it's that when you get older when there's a certain sort of invisible boundary that happens in maybe your mid 40s where you, I guess you don't look fertile anymore, it's a menopausal thing,"" she continued. ""And maybe it's because you're starting to look a little like people's mom, that sexy is not allowed.

"New homebuyers are seeking old homes, unaware of how costly renovations can be",lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//real-estate/homebuyers-old-houses-unaware-costs," is all romance until it’s time to escape from your creditor. With a large share of the nation’s workforce continuing to work remotely, many used their downtime last year to fulfill their dream of   far from plague-ridden urban centers. Data from Realtor.com shows that sales of homes built more than 100 years ago rose by 16% in 2020 in the tri-state area (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut) compared to last year, with a median sale price of $236,000. During the same period, New York City saw a sales decline of 6% overall. ""The biggest ask right now is ‘something old with character’ — newer homes have none of the richness or the stories of something built in 1814,"" New York-based Compass agent Adam Carroll told The Post. Viral social media accounts like Elizabeth and Ethan Finkelstein’s   feed on Instagram — which spotlights dilapidated properties for sale for less than $100,000 and boasts 1.5 million followers — fanned the flames, galvanizing real estate markets in historic areas across the country. But while ""cheap old house"" buyers may see ""good bones"" when they pick up a stunning Queen Anne or a cool Craftsman bungalow, experts warn that restoring these money pits to their former glory requires serious know-how and a fat checking account. Four months ago, attorney Stephen Simcock, 58, found out firsthand. He purchased a 170-year-old waterfront fixer-upper in the Hudson Valley when the pandemic changed his work/life balance. He declined to reveal the exact cost of his new retreat, but he paid more than three times the area’s median listing price of $775,000, according to Realtor.com. ""I might have legal title, but I’m joining its story,"" said Simcock of the Greek Revival property in the hamlet of Barrytown, New York. A 4,200-square-foot former ice store, complete with the ghost foundations of demolished storage houses dotted across its 1½-acre grounds, the four-bedroom home boasts a torrid history. ""In its various iterations, this house has been a store, definitely a hotel, maybe a brothel, a halfway house, a college dorm and then a single-family house,"" he paused, laughing, ""I like to think I bring a little of all of that."" Simcock said he knew what he was getting into when he bought the house. For instance, he knew that he would add bathrooms, open up the kitchen and replace the small, heat-conserving windows, typical of their time, with large frames to maximize his water views. ""The goal is for it to become a really beautiful country house, having accreted so much charm over the years, but with more creature comforts,"" he said. All of those elements came with costly challenges. But it was the antique beadboard (vertically grooved wall panels) that caught him by surprise. The decorative wood molding, which runs down his stairway, had been stripped from most of the walls. Simply identifying the specific style of board has been a challenge; finding matching replacements has been a head-scratcher. Hunting down matches for rare newel posts and spindles (the decoratively turned supports on a staircase or railing) was also difficult. ""I’m a dilettante, but I’m doing it with as much rigor as I can."" Simcock said. ""I’m poring over books of architecture and design to find the perfect, perfectly authentic pieces."""

Results stemmed from the multi-case control study   and validated questionnaires sent to nearly 8,000 adults, half of whom had diagnoses for colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer, and the other half serving as the control group, without cancer diagnoses. The questionnaire assessed how often participants consumed ultra-processed foods and drinks over a one-year period. The team then used the Nova classification system, which divides foods into four categories, from unprocessed foods to processed ingredients, and beyond to processed foods and ultra-processed foods and drinks. Examples of ultra-processed products would include ""sugary soft drinks, ready meals and mass-produced industrial baked goods,"" a related   from ISGlobal notes. ""Ultra-processed foods — those that undergo the most processing — are industrial formulations with more than five ingredients which usually contain additional substances, such as sugar, fats, salt and additives,"" reads the release. The team ultimately found that a ""10% increment in the consumption of ultra-processed foods and drinks was found to be associated with an 11% increase in the risk of developing colorectal cancer."" Study author and ISGlobal researcher Dora Romaguera said diets low in fruits and vegetables are missing out on protective benefits against colorectal cancer and suggested the heightened cancer risk is fueled by ""additives and other substances with carcinogenic potential typically used in processed food products."" Common ultra-processed foods consumed by participants included sugary drinks, sugary products, ready meals and processed meats. For breast cancer patients with a history of smoking, or who currently smoke, Romaguera says smoking and a diet high in ultra-processed foods compound to increase the risk of developing cancer. Given the health risks associated with these sugary, processed foods and drinks, Pilar Amiano, a researcher at the Guipúzcoa Public Health Service, said the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( ) should already incorporate the findings into policies and dissuade consumption of these foods."
California teens can go to an amusement park but can't go to math class,lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//us/california-teens-can-go-to-an-amusement-park-but-cant-go-to-math-class,"Over one year into the coronavirus pandemic that rocked the economy and   in-person teaching, many students across   are still unable to receive in-person teaching. While schools in Long Beach and Orange County have reopened their schools to allow for some version of in-person instruction, many districts remain shut to students. In Oakland, an agreement to reopen classrooms early between the district and teachers unions was rescinded after teachers refused to return before the mandatory start date of April 14, despite being offered priority vaccinations and cash incentives. The refusal by Oakland teachers meant that high needs students, including homeless, foster and special needs students, were unable to get into a classroom this week. In southern California Friday,   released a poll by San Deigo Unified parents that showed nearly 73 percent of parents want their kids to receive in-person teaching, though just 64 percent of families responded to the poll. A frustrated associate professor at UCSF directed her frustration at Gov. Newsom in a Friday tweet, saying California’s priorities were misaligned with the best interest of the state’s residents. ""There are no hidden complexities that could possibly explain this misalignment of social priorities,""   said, before highlighting San Francisco’s permitted activities like amusement parks and movie theatres while classrooms remain shut. San Francisco Unified School District and School Board were sued by the city of San Francisco earlier this year in an attempt to get the board moving on reopening classrooms. The board garnered nationwide attention after they prioritized renaming schools they felt were racist or represented colonial oppression, instead of creating a plan on how to get children back to in-person instruction. California has allowed each district to take on re-opening plans in order to address the needs of students dependent on the severity of the coronavirus in their district. But many have been frustrated by the state’s refusal to step in and push schools to reopen in a more cohesive manner. While teachers in northern California have been inflexible on in-person teaching, teachers in San Diego are now allowed to choose between teaching their students or swapping shifts to teach migrant children in-person. Students under the San Diego County Office Of Education are currently learning in an online-format only at this time. But more than 700 unaccompanied children staying at the the San Diego Convention Center are receiving in-person teaching by volunteer instructors, Fox News learned this week. ""We have 130,000 kids who haven't been allowed in a classroom for over a year in the San Diego Unified School District. It's great that there's in-person learning for those unaccompanied minors from Central America, but I wish every child in San Diego County was allowed the same opportunity for in-person teaching,"" San Diego County Supervisor Jim Desmond told Fox News.  Several schools in San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco will begin reopening schools in mid-April, though it is unclear if students will be able to return for full time in-person teaching this year."

NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei readies for April flight to International Space Station,lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//science/nasa-astronaut-mark-vande-hei-readies-for-april-flight-to-iss,"   Mark Vande Hei is set to lift off aboard the Soyuz MS-18   on an April 9 mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The flight engineer and Expeditions 64 and 65 crew member will launch that Friday from   Baikonur Cosmodrome alongside   cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Pyotr Dubrov. Speaking with Fox News last week, the 54-year-old said his team had completed the final examinations for activities on both the   and the ISS. Vande Hei noted that   has had a ""big impact"" on the astronauts' training, from wearing masks around others to making sure the virus is not carried up to the space station.  ""We'll be in quarantine, we'll get monitored very frequently to make sure that we're staying  . And then, we'll have time to  , relax, walk around outside. I'm going to try to make sure I spend as much time outside as possible while I still have the chance. And, just make sure I have everything in order before we go,"" he said. ""In addition to that, we will also review a lot of the procedures that we'll be using to actually get to the space station. We'll do those pretty frequently."" Once the three have arrived at the space station, the veteran astronaut expects the first month to ""feel a lot different"" than his previous expedition in 2017.  ""I had a lot of adjusting to do, a lot of lessons to learn how to operate in an environment where the way I normally behave wouldn't work. I lost a lot of things in that first month [and] it was very frustrating and so many things that I could do without any conscious effort on the ground required me to concentrate completely,"" he explained. ""So, I'm hoping a lot of those lessons I learned will come right back to me and I'll be able to start sprinting this time."" Vande Hei has been with the agency since 2006, when he joined   Johnson Space Center as a capsule communicator (CAPCOM) in the Mission Control Center. , Vande Hei served as an ISS CAPCOM for Expeditions 15 to 20 and STS-122, 123, 124, 126 and 127.

Vande Hei told Fox News that he perceives his   aboard the ISS as being like a laboratory technician and that it's ""interesting work."" ""There are scientists that put a lot of thought into what experiments they want to get done. They're doing the data gathering and the data analysis and writing papers. My job is to facilitate if those things work when it's up there,"" he said. ""I need to make sure that they have the resources they need. If something needs to be troubleshot, I'll help out with the troubleshooting,"" Vande Hei continued. ""Sometimes those scientists will be looking over our shoulder with a video camera and will actually be coaching us on what they want us to do to try to help make things work."" The applied physician pointed out that he himself is ""part of the science experiment"" when discussing NASA's upcoming   to the   and companies like Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic and   SpaceX testing commercial spaceflights.  ""So, when we are on the space station that's a capability that we need to maintain somehow. But, we also want to start having these new capabilities, like you mentioned, with the Artemis program,"" said Vande Hei. ""It's going to be really hard if we can't do both of those things, all of those things, if all of the burden of that falls on the  ."" ""So, having ways where we can facilitate this continued capability to put people in lower   orbit both to do science and to train for longer duration missions and to learn about how to have people survive on long-duration missions and function well ...the only way we're going to be able to do that is if we can have that be commercially successful,"" he added.

Dr. Robert Jeffress: Easter 2021 and the hope an empty tomb offers us all,lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//opinion/easter-2021-empty-tomb-robert-jeffress,"Last year’s   felt more like one, unending Good Friday. The light and hope that Easter usually offered was eclipsed by the darkness and despair the disciples experienced the day Jesus Christ died.      One year ago there was widespread fear throughout the world as the first wave of the   was raging. Countries were on lockdown. Churches were empty. Things were bleak. A pall was descending over our world, and we wondered if it would ever be lifted.  In the last year, each of us has experienced some dark moments. We’ve faced the very real possibility of our own  . At one particularly low point last year, my wife and I spent a day searching for and then purchasing our cemetery plots in case we became victims of the  .  News about death and dying has been inescapable—and it’s not just from the media. You may have received a text or phone call from a friend or family member informing you that a loved one is gone. These moments give us a small glimpse into how the disciples must have felt on the darkest day in history, what we now call ""Good"" Friday. Of course, to those who were living through it, nothing about it seemed ""good."" The motley band of disciples who had followed Jesus all across Israel for three years sat stunned. The One they thought might be the Messiah was gasping for air, nailed to a Roman cross. The great hopes they had for a new kingdom and an end to their suffering felt like wishful fantasies. But light shines brightest after we’ve been immersed in the dark. It’s like coming out of a dark movie theater after seeing a matinee—you’re blinded by the light of the sun, which suddenly seems so much brighter. That’s how Easter 2021 has been for me. After months of drudgery, the end of the pandemic finally feels real to me. I remember how excited I was driving down the Dallas North Tollway a few months ago  to get my first dose of the COVID vaccine. To my surprise, during my commute to the vaccination site, President Trump  called me from Air Force One.  As delighted as I was talk with the former president,  I was more focused on making sure I didn’t miss out on getting to the location on time and receiving my vaccine!   For me, the end of the pandemic brings some hope that I can once again experience the little things I enjoy so much. I can hug my grandkids, catch up with old friends, and visit my favorite restaurants again. The stark contrast between the dark days of 2020 and now the dawning of the pandemic’s end mirrors the contrast between the darkness of the  present curse under which the world labors and the bright hope Easter offers of the end of that curse.  No more separations, no more sickness, no more death, and no more night.   The hopefulness we feel about the end of the pandemic is just a  temporal hope. But the empty tomb offers a permanent, unending hope. This week we celebrate the single event on which eternity turns—the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.     On that dark Good Friday when the sun stopped shining and the earth trembled, God was doing something far greater than anyone could see or comprehend. By His suffering and death, Christ atoned for our sins and paid the payment for sin that we deserved to pay. He was put into a tomb on Friday with mourning, but three days later on that  Easter morning He emerged triumphant over sin and death. God turned the darkest moment in all of history–that Good Friday when Christ died--into the brightest celebration of life-giving hope on Easter Sunday. When the world was swallowed up in darkness, God was working to make all things bright and new. The good news is that He can do that in your life, as well.  Whatever pain you’ve endured this last year, the resurrection of Jesus Christ offers the assurance that the suffering you have experienced--though very real--is also very temporary.  One day, as the Scripture promises, the world’s curse we live under will be removed and ""death will be swallowed up in victory.""  That’s the hope an empty tomb offers."

Missouri's abandoned $1.6B 'ghost town' resort rocks TikTok,lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//real-estate/missouri-abandoned-ghost-town-resort-tiktok,"Wondering why these   developers wound up in the big house? TikTok users are captivated by the convoluted tale of how a   in   became an abandoned land of McMansions, in the latest real estate rant to rock the platform. Though the deserted Indian Ridge Resort in Branson is old lore in Show-Me State, lawyer Carrie Jernigan recently resurfaced the story in a TikTok tour posted last week. ""This was supposed to be a 1.6 billion dollar resort community. It was going to have one of the country’s largest water parks, golf courses, hotels conference centers and shopping,"" Jernigan said in a now-viral video, driving by the spooky subdivision. ""But instead it turned into a ghost town when the 2008 housing crisis hit. Five people had ended up in federal prison. And 13 years later the houses just sit here."" A real-life real estate fraud scheme was carried out in 2006, when developers from Western Site Services lied to get loans for an opulent project called Indian Ridge Resort Community,   at the time. The 900-acre project with a $1.6 billion price tag promised residential townhomes and condos, a 390-room resort hotel with the second-largest indoor water park in America, golfing, a marina and a Native American history museum. However, the project crumbled when the government caught on to the suspicious activity, and the developers were eventually sent to prison. ""A few of them were charged and convicted with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Essentially they were lying on bank applications at multiple banks to get massive amounts of money, and then when they were getting the money, they weren't even spending it on Indian Ridge Resort,"" the attorney explained in a follow-up clip. ""They were spending it on old loans that they were in default on, and just some of their personal ventures. A few of their wives even went down because they were found to have lied on invoices and were complicit in this whole deal."" The firms that fronted the project – Indian Ridge Resort, Inc. and North Shore Investments, LLC – were also fined hundreds of thousands of dollars for failing to prevent storm water runoff from construction from shooting silt into Table Rock Lake, according to the  Now, Jernigan’s original tour has since been viewed over 14.5 million times online, and users had a whole lot to say about the creepy community that’s been abandoned ever since.

Hundreds of French sports figures accused of sexual violence,sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/hundreds-of-french-sports-figures-accused-of-sexual-violence,"A year-long, nationwide French effort to uncover and combat sexual violence in sports has identified more than 400 coaches, teachers and others suspected of abuse or covering it up. Most of the victims were under 15, according to data released Friday by the sports ministry. The alleged abuse included sexual assault, harassment or other violence. Sixty people have faced criminal proceedings, more than 100 have been temporarily or permanently removed from their posts, and local investigations are under way into other cases, the ministry said. The abuse reached across the country and across the whole sector, with accusations targeting a total of 48 sports federations. Of those accused, 96% are men. Of the victims, 83% were women or girls, and 63% were under 15, the ministry said. The fact-finding probe was launched in February 2020 after 10-time French skating champion Sarah Abitbol said in a book that she was raped by coach Gilles Beyer from 1990-92, when she was a teen. Beyer was handed preliminary charges of sexual assault and the investigation is ongoing. In the wake of Abitbol’s accusations, more skaters spoke out to denounce alleged sexual violence from coaches. The sports ministry set up a dedicated platform for athletes’ testimonies and conducted a year of hearings. In its statement, the ministry called Abitbol’s testimony ""a historic moment for French sport"" that raised awareness and has pushed authorities to crack down on abuse. A new law on tougher screening of sports educators, including volunteer coaches, went into effect Friday, and the French government and sports federations have pledged to respond faster and more effectively to reports of abuse. Sports Minister Roxana Maracineanu has played a key role in raising awareness. In a recent interview with The Associated Press, the former swimming champion described her own experiences facing sexism, and said it's time for French mindsets to change when it comes to women's rights within the male-dominated sports world. At a government meeting Friday to assess efforts to fight sexual violence, Abitbol told the group that she's ""healing"" and was glad to see other victims speaking out, according to L'Equipe newspaper. Former tennis champion Isabelle Demongeot described the ""battle"" she faced among the public and colleagues after accusing her coach of rape. Former hammer thrower Catherine Moyon de Beacque, who first spoke out about abuse in 1991, welcomed the current action ""at the highest level of the state."""
No. 1 Barty repeats as Miami champ when Andreescu retires,sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/no-1-barty-repeats-as-miami-champ-when-andreescu-retires,"No. 1-ranked Ash Barty won her second successive Miami Open championship Saturday by beating No. 8-seeded Bianca Andreescu, who was injured when she fell and retired trailing in the second set. Andreescu, crying and shaking her head, conceded while behind 6-3, 4-0. She stumbled and went sprawling two games earlier when she turned her foot awkwardly while hitting a forehand. During the ensuing changeover, a trainer taped her foot, but she played only five more points before retiring. ""Definitely not the way I wanted to end the tournament,"" Andreescu said, ""but I'm super grateful nonetheless. I got to the final of one of my first tournaments in a while now, and I could not be more happy."" The match was the first between Barty and Andreescu, and a potential friendly rivalry looms. ""I hope you recover well and this doesn’t hinder your season too much,"" Barty told Andreescu during the trophy ceremony. ""I'm sure we’ll have many more good and hopefully healthy matches in the future."" A 20-year-old Canadian, Andreescu has been plagued by injuries in her short career, and the tournament was her first in the United States since she won the 2019 U.S. Open. The coronavirus pandemic also curtailed her schedule. Barty, a 24-year-old from Australia, dominated from the start of the final with her strong serve and all-court game, and Andreescu looked weary after playing three sets in each of her previous four matches — all at night. Barty was also the 2019 Miami champion. The tournament was canceled last year at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Five other women have won consecutive Miami titles: Stefanie Graf, Monica Seles, Arantxa Sánchez-Vicario, Venus Williams and Serena Williams. On Sunday, 19-year-old Italian Jannik Sinner will try to become the youngest men’s champion in tournament history when he plays No. 26-seeded Hubert Hurkacz of Poland. Each is seeking the biggest title of his career. Barty, playing outside of Australia for the first time since February 2020, was one point from defeat in her opening match against Kristina Kucova. She gained momentum from there and will keep her No. 1 ranking next week. ""It’s a great start for us,"" Barty said. ""I'm looking forward to what will hopefully be a big season for us, and hopefully we can play some really good tennis."" Because the pandemic reduced tournament revenue and severely limited attendance, the champion received $300,110, compared with the $1.35 million Barty won in 2019. Only 750 fans were allowed on the grounds per session."
Emmert promises WBCA he will work to fix 'stark' inequities,sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/emmert-promises-wbca-he-will-work-to-fix-stark-inequities,"NCAA President Mark Emmert promised the Women's Basketball Coaches Association he will work with coaches to fix the ""stark difference"" between the Division I men's and women's tournaments. While Emmert noted that a major hurdle was trying to hold both basketball tournaments in kind of identical format required by the coronavirus pandemic, he added nobody liked the results and nobody wants to see similar issues crop up in other sports in coming months. ""I, too, believe that it’s exactly the right moment to do it,"" Emmert said. ""You got my commitment, my personal commitment to spend an enormous amount of time and energy on on this problem and and making sure that we don’t lose the chance."" Emmert and the NCAA's heads of basketball Dan Gavitt and Lynn Holzman discussed the conditions in San Antonio on Wednesday with members of the WBCA, including two of the Final Four coaches — UConn's Geno Auriemma and Dawn Staley of South Carolina. Several differences surfaced over the past two weeks, starting with female players, coaches and staff in San Antonio criticizing the NCAA for not initially providing a full weight-training area to the women’s teams, noting the men’s teams in Indianapolis did not have the same problem. Questions during the coaches' meeting with Emmert ranged from the use of ""March Madness"" for branding, the number of NCAA staffers for both basketball tournaments (12 for the men, six for the women), the budget for both tournaments and why the NCAA doesn't own the WNIT as it does the NIT. The WBCA sent a letter to Emmert last week saying the external review he proposed to look into potential gender equity issues wasn't good enough. In the letter, obtained by The Associated Press, the WBCA asked for a ""Commission on Gender Inequity in College Sports"" led by people chosen by both the WBCA and NCAA. Staley asked for assurances that the law firm hired by the NCAA to review potential gender equity issues is truly independent. ""Whoever is paying the piper, more than likely they’re going to give you what you want to hear,"" Staley said. Emmert said the Kaplan, Hecker & Fink law firm specializes in Title IX issues nationally and has no prior relationship with the NCAA. E  the firm would review potential gender equity issues in all men’s and women’s championship events with basketball a key focus. Muffett McGraw, who retired as Notre Dame head coach last year, said the WBCA has total confidence in Holzman. The former Irish coach noted the NCAA added a rule a few years ago holding head coaches accountable for anything that goes wrong and asked why Holzman doesn't report directly to Emmert. ""In the gender equity policy that you have, it appears that you have violated your own guidelines in what has happened in San Antonio with regard to the disparity between us and the men. However, it’s not just San Antonio,"" McGraw said. ""This is way deeper than that."" Auriemma said the bigger issue isn't an NCAA problem but exists on individual campuses with presidents and athletic directors. He asked Emmert what he could do to make sure those people give women's basketball the same advantages and opportunities. The UConn coach also mentioned how football coaches broke away from NCAA control. ""Maybe that’s what has to happen in women’s basketball?"" Auriemma said. ""Maybe women’s basketball has got to separate itself from the other women’s sports? But then that would be unfair because we would be leaving a lot of people behind that need our help."" Georgia Tech coach Nell Fortner, who  , asked about the use of the March Madness logos. Emmert told her he's been studying the branding but there currently is no legal or contractual restraints. Fortner said the use of ""March Madness"" and other branding was like ""eye candy"" that makes a viewer stop and watch on TV. Yet for the women's Sweet 16 and Elite Eight, only ""NCAA Women's Basketball"" was in the middle of the court. She also argued the women are a huge potential revenue stream with TV numbers backing that up. ""We're going to miss a huge window if we don’t change things now, if we really don’t step up to the plate at the NCAA as a whole to really water this sport, to really water this sport, to really give it the attention that it deserves,"" Fortner said."
"Walmart shopper subdues maskless man who allegedly threatened to assault customers, video shows",lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//lifestyle/walmart-shopper-subdues-maskless-man-washington-threatened-assault-customers,"This guy squared off with the wrong   customer. A maskless man who allegedly threatened to assault the customers at a   in Washington State was promptly beaten down by a no-nonsense shopper earlier this week. The incident, which was caught on film and shared with Seattle's  , took place on Tuesday at a Walmart location in Federal Way, police confirmed. In the footage, the suspect, identified as 29-year-old Troy K. Robinson, is first seen ignoring Walmart employees who attempt to escort him out of the store, before a 21-year-old shopper intervenes. Police say the suspect had been threatening ""to assault anyone who touched him,"" which is when the 21-year-old ""stepped in and confronted,"" per a statement shared with Fox News. The men then engaged in a physical altercation near the entrance to the store, which ended when the shopper yanked the suspect to the ground and subdued him. Police took the man into custody immediately following his removal from the retail location. Following an investigation, the Federal Way Police Department claimed the suspect had earlier slammed into a parked car upon driving into the Walmart’s parking lot, then simply walked into the store before ""attempting to shoplift."" He was also offered a mask upon entry, which he removed after entering. He now faces charges for driving under the influence, hit and run, and attempted theft in the third degree. A representative for the Federal Way Police Department’s Public Information Office was not immediately available to provide further information."
High court sympathetic to college athletes in NCAA dispute,sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/high-court-sympathetic-to-college-athletes-in-ncaa-dispute,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday seemed ready to give college athletes a win in a dispute with the NCAA over rules limiting their education-related compensation. With the   in its final stages, the high court heard arguments in a case about how   who play Division I basketball and football. Under current NCAA rules, students cannot be paid, and the scholarship money colleges can offer is capped at the cost of attending the school. The NCAA defends its rules as necessary to preserve the amateur nature of college sports. But the   including former West Virginia football player Shawne Alston, say the NCAA’s rules are unfair and violate federal antitrust law designed to promote competition. The outcome will help determine how college athletes are compensated and whether schools can offer tens of thousands of dollars in education benefits for things such as postgraduate scholarships, tutoring, study abroad opportunities and vocational school payments. During an hour and a half of   conducted  , both liberal and conservative justices   to students. Justice Elena Kagan suggested that what was going on sounded a lot like price fixing. ""Schools that are naturally competitors ... have all gotten together in an organization,"" she said, and used their power to ""fix athletic salaries at extremely low levels."" Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed. He told a lawyer for the NCAA that ""it does seem ... schools are conspiring with competitors ... to pay no salaries for the workers who are making the schools billions of dollars on the theory that consumers want the schools to pay their workers nothing."" Kavanaugh said that was ""somewhat disturbing."" A ruling for the former players would not necessarily mean an immediate infusion of cash to current college athletes. It would mean that the NCAA could not bar schools from sweetening their offers to Division I basketball and football athletes with additional education-related benefits. Individual athletic conferences could still set limits. Still, if the athletes were to win, there would be pressure on schools to offer additional benefits, and that could create bidding wars for the best players. The NCAA says that could turn off fans and erase the distinction between professional and college sports. Whatever happens at the high court, changes seem on the way for how college athletes are compensated. The NCAA is in the process of trying to amend its rules to allow athletes to profit from their names, images and likenesses. That would allow athletes to earn money for things like sponsorship deals, online endorsement and personal appearances. For some athletes, those amounts could dwarf any education-related benefits. The former college athletes have some big-time supporters. The players associations of the NFL, NBA and WNBA all urged the justices to side with the ex-athletes, as did the Biden administration. So far, the former players have won every round of the case. A decision in the case is expected before the end of June, when the high court traditionally breaks for summer."
"Fully vaccinated people can travel safely within US, CDC says",lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//travel/cdc-fully-vaccinated-people-travel-low-risk,"People who are fully vaccinated against the   can   safely in the U.S. without getting tested or self-quarantining, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Friday.  However, travelers should still continue to wear masks, practice social distancing and wash their hands, whether they are fully vaccinated or not, according to the  .  The CDC updated its   on Friday, saying: ""Fully vaccinated travelers are less likely to get and spread COVID-19."" The agency did say that if a destination requires testing, fully vaccinated travelers would still need to adhere to the destination's requirements. Fully vaccinated travelers should also still continue to self-monitor for coronavirus symptoms, self-isolate if they develop such symptoms, and follow all state and local requirements, the CDC says. People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or two weeks after their Johnson & Johnson vaccine.  Travelers who are only partially vaccinated, or have not reached the two-week mark after their final dose, should continue to follow the CDC’s recommendations for unvaccinated people.  Even before the CDC's updated guidelines, Americans were already getting back to travel. Earlier this week, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) data showed that the   more than 1 million travelers every day for 19 days in a row. That   through 22 days as of Thursday, marking the most prolonged travel rebound since the pandemic started more than a year ago. Airlines have also seen an uptick in demand. American Airlines told AP on Monday that bookings are nearly back to pre-pandemic levels; other airlines including Southwest and Delta said their bookings started increasing in mid-February. Last month, the CDC said fully vaccinated people could also   without masks with other fully vaccinated people. The agency further suggested that vaccinated individuals mingling indoors with unvaccinated individuals who are considered low-risk for severe COVID-19 infection, poses a low risk. However, the CDC advised all Americans to avoid larger indoor gatherings and wear masks in public and high-risk settings, regardless of vaccination status.   Those recommendations were supported by health experts. ""This guidance is really thoughtful,""  , infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care, wrote to Fox News last month. ""It balances removing some precautions under low risk conditions while maintaining them in high risk and public situations."""
"Players hear 'a lot of talk' from Emmert about Title IX, NIL",sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/players-hear-a-lot-of-talk-from-emmert-about-title-ix-nil,"A trio of men's basketball players asked NCAA President Mark Emmert during a video call Thursday to abide by, and enforce, Title IX gender equity rules and to create a waiver that would let college athletes start earning money from use of their names, images and likenesses this year. What did the three students say they heard in return? ""A lot of talk,"" according to Iowa’s Jordan Bohannon. Another player involved, Rutgers’ Geo Baker, said Emmert repeatedly referred to waiting for Congress to intervene and summed up the session this way: ""What it really sounded like was that the NCAA doesn’t really want to be the first to make action."" ""We brought up a lot of our points, and it’s kind of like he would say the same thing and kind of agree with us. But that really wasn’t going anywhere,"" Michigan’s Isaiah Livers said. ""And obviously, from what I hear, he likes to kind of talk about points instead of make action."" Emmert's take: ""We had a really good, really constructive conversation,"" he said during an availability later Thursday, ""and I look forward to continuing to work with them and others."" In coordination with the National College Players Association, the athletes used a social media campaign — with the Twitter hashtag #NotNCAAProperty — during March Madness to protest rules that deny NIL rights and to put a spotlight on differences between the men's and women's basketball tournaments wrapping up this weekend in Indiana and Texas. ""Let this be the last NCAA tournament designed to treat women’s basketball players as inferior to men’s basketball players. Let this be the last NCAA tournament that generates a billion dollars from the talents of predominately black basketball players who aren’t allowed to make one dime off their own name,"" Ramogi Huma, executive director of the National College Players Association, said on a call with reporters after the three players spoke with Emmert and, in a separate video meeting, Sens. Cory Booker and Richard Blumenthal. ""This is why we’re all here today — to call for an end to the economic, racial and sex-based discrimination NCAA sports imposes on college athletes,"" Huma said. Title IX says schools that receive federal funding must provide equal opportunities to men and women. But even if the trio that met with Emmert knows the rules do not specifically apply to NCAA action, they think its principles should be followed by the group that oversees college sports, especially in light of  . ""It wasn’t a mistake. It was almost like it was clearly done that they didn’t want to put as much effort (into) the women’s that they did for the men’s,"" Bohannon said. ""So us requesting that is further hopefully understanding in the future that this situation will never happen again."" In addition to the Title IX and NIL topics, Emmert was asked to give players more of a voice in the process, including in front of the Division I Council and Board of Governors. Huma said miscommunication led to there not being any female athletes present for the video meeting with Emmert, who said: ""We need to do the same thing with women’s athletes, by the way. Obviously, I haven’t talked to any athletes on the women’s side but want to do that as soon as possible."" There were women's basketball players who spoke to the media along with Bohannon, Baker and Livers. They said they were upset about the much-discussed differences between the two basketball tournaments. They also wanted to look forward and make the case for how NIL rights can help college athletes. ""I’m here just because I’m not sure that anything will change by the time I leave here,"" Michigan junior forward Naz Hillmon said, ""but I hope to see some change."" The blanket waiver would permit players to seek NIL endorsement deals as soon as July, before any full action comes on Capitol Hill, where there is legislation pending. And Emmert's response on that? ""Basically he said he’s going to get back to us. There wasn’t a direct answer. That was one of the times where he kept talking about Congress, you know? Needing help from Congress. What can Congress do first?"" Baker said. ""And then he basically said, ‘Well, if Congress doesn’t do anything, then we can discuss the other possibilities, like a blanket waiver.’ Kind of going around the question a little bit, basically just saying he’ll get back to us about it."""
NFL veteran Colt McCoy linked to 'Eyes of Texas' alumni pressure on university to keep song,sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/nfl-colt-mccoy-eyes-of-texas-alumni-pressure-song,"Veteran NFL quarterback Colt McCoy was reportedly a part of an alumni-charged effort to persuade the   to keep its spirit song ""Eyes of Texas"" amid pushback over alleged racist ties. McCoy, along with former NFL player Jordan Shipley and several other powerful alumni, was a part of emails discussing the backlash against the song in June, the   reported, citing emails the publication obtained. McCoy was reportedly on a conference call with energy entrepreneur Bud Brigham and other alums to talk about the song and come up with other ideas to remedy the situation. Scott Ingraham, another Texas alumnus, told those on the email chain the group should contact school president Jay Hartzell and athletic director Chris Del Conte and steer them away from making an immediate decision, according to the Texas Tribune. Ingraham also suggested that the school create a task force to review the song. ""A diverse group to illuminate the history and also the value of the song for ALL the stakeholders would be a healthy and beneficial process, as opposed to what is happening now with demands, or else,"" Brigham reportedly wrote to Hartzell on June 29. According to the newspaper, Brigham also wrote that the former Longhorns quarterback might suggest a task force to Del Conte. The committee was formed and a determination was made, but University of Texas at Austin spokesman J.B. Bird told the newspaper that the committee wasn’t formed due to alumni suggestions. McCoy did not comment on the story and the extent of his influence was not clear. He recently signed a one-year deal with the  . Hartzell declined to comment. On Monday, the Texas NAACP, along with Black Texas elected officials, some civil rights leaders, and Texas students and alumni held a press conference to announce their fight for the school to stop using the song, according to  . Critics of the song have said the ""Eyes of Texas"" has Confederacy ties. A 58-page report on the song was released by the university in March. A 24-person panel that convened to determine the meaning behind the song’s roots, lyrics and history   and striving toward excellence. The title of the song was reportedly taken from a favored saying of a former school president who had mimicked remarks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and was performed by musicians in blackface at minstrel shows. However, the panel could not find a direct link to the line ""the eyes of Texas are upon you"" and Lee. While alumni expressed issues with players not standing and participating in the playing of the song, Hartzell said in March that no student-athlete would be mandated to do so. ""Nobody has been, or will be, required to sing the song,"" Hartzell said. ""That's going to be going forward the way we continue to operate. We hope that as people go through the report, read through the facts, they'll find ways to participate in some way. Whether it's the case of the athletes standíng on the field, or the fans in the stands as we sing, there's going to be no punishment, no mandate, no requirement if people choose not to participate."""
Francis Ngannou becomes new UFC heavyweight champ after Stipe Miocic knockout,sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/francis-ngannou-stipe-miocic-ufc-260-heavyweight-champ,"Francis Ngannou knocked out Stipe Miocic in the second round of   to become the new heavyweight championship on Saturday night in Las Vegas. Ngannou landed a couple of nasty punches early in the second round and appeared to corner Miocic against the cage. Miocic got back up and hit Ngannou and thought he had the advantage in the moment but opened himself up for more damage from the Cameroon native. Ngannou landed a nasty hook and caught Miocic by surprise and stayed on top of him for the win. It was a complete 180 from their first match at UFC 220 in 2018 when the fight went the full five rounds. Ngannou lost that match via unanimous decision and came all the way back more than three years later to get his revenge to become the 17th undisputed heavyweight champion in UFC history. After the 2018 loss to Miocic, he would lose again that year to Derrick Lewis. Ngannou needed wins against Curtis Blaydes, Cain Velasquez, Junior dos Santos and Jarizinho Rozenstruik to even get a shot at the heavyweight title again. Who’s next for ""The Predator""? UFC legend Daniel Cormier, who was on the ESPN broadcast, floated the idea of a fight between Ngannou and Jon Jones. ""Bones"" last fought in February 2020. Jones hasn’t lost sine 2009 and is considered to be one of the best fighters in UFC history. Jones has previously said he’d move up to heavyweight. He tweeted after the fight, ""show me the money."" **  def. Tyron Woodley via submission  def. Thomas Almeida via knockout  def. Gillian Robertson via unanimous decision  def. Kharma Worthy"
NFL legend Ray Lewis tackling new challenge – the Professional Fighters League,sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/nfl-ray-lewis-professional-fighters-league-mma,":   legend Ray Lewis is taking his skills off the field and into the cage. The Pro Football Hall of Fame linebacker, 12-time Pro Bowler and two-time Super Bowl champion is teaming up with the Professional Fighters League (PFL) in a new role aimed at advancing the sport of mixed martial arts (MMA). ""There’s not a lot of options – only 1% make it in the National Football League, the NBA and so on – but when you have these people with these types of skills, I have an eye for that. I have an eye for people who have the will but don’t have the opportunity, people who have the skills but not the right platform,"" Lewis told Fox News in a recent interview. ""So, from a leadership side, it’s like me coming in giving all the motivation I’ve been given for years and empowering people to succeed."" Lewis joins MMA legend Randy Couture as the second member of the Athlete Advisory Board, which will be comprised of MMA champions, sports icons and experts in the medical field. Additional announcements are expected in the coming months. ""Ray is a champion, a true athlete and leader. Ray started his athletic journey as a wrestler, and MMA inspires him and so it’s a great fit,"" Peter Murray, PFL CEO said. ""He’s so passionate about the sport of MMA, its growth and ultimately the PFL’s vision."" As a member of the advisory board, Lewis, who spent his entire 17-year NFL career with the   and was one of the league’s top defensive players of all-time, will identify new talent and help drive the fighter-first culture of the PFL. ""Every day you have to have an edge, every day you have to be motivating yourself in life to lead. If you can get more people in these sports, as opposed to doing other things, then we win,"" Lewis said. ""That’s where I think me working with Randy Couture will be really exciting because it's combining our skills and life experiences."" Since its debut in 2018, the PFL has been a rising star on the MMA stage. Unlike the UFC, which features a handful of fights during each event, including preliminary bouts, the main card and a marquee fight usually for a title – the PFL operates much more like an NFL season would. ""It's a format built on meritocracy that works for every major athlete from the NFL to the NBA,"" Murray said. ""Fighters win to advance, those who lose go home. There is a regular season, a playoff and a championship."" The playoff-style format and the chance for the best athletes to advance and earn the million-dollar championship prize are what really drew Lewis to the PFL. ""The format is way better than what the MMA gives us right now. I just love that you have this real avenue to be successful – they want the same thing any NFL player wants. They want chances to be noticed, to go against top people in the business and make some good money,"" Lewis said. In just a few years since its first season, the PFL has already 25% of the audience of the UFC, according to  . ""What’s driving that success is a couple of factors – there's an underserved fan base of 550 million fans around the world, 80% of those fans are outside the U.S., 20% in the U.S.,"" Murray said. ""It is the youngest fan base of all major sports and half of this overall fan base they're not watching stick and ball sports, they want access to more premium quality MMA and the PFL delivers that."" Murray added that the PFL format provides another layer of success, being easy to follow with great narratives and big stars. ""With our sports season format, it’s actually complimentary to the UFC. It is distributed on ESPN on a different night of the week for those avid MMA fans as well as the casual fans,"" Murray added.    is still the heavy hitter, being valued at $7 billion, according to president Dana White, and highlights some of the biggest names in the sport like Conor McGregor and Ronda Rousey. But with new sponsorships lined up, initiatives to expand its global reach, and new stars like Anthony Pettis and Kayla Harrison, the PFL is excited about its future. ""From Anheuser-Busch InBev, Geico to the armed forces are our current sponsors and we’ve partnered with IBM and many other major brands,"" Murray said, adding that there will be some major announcements ahead of the 2021 season from ""brands in some of the top spending categories in sports who have never sponsored MMA properties or events before."" The PFL opted to cancel its 2020 season due to COVID concerns, but Murray expects a strong bounce back from all the ""pent-up excitement"" when the fighters make their 2021 season debut on ESPN on April 23. ""The playoff-style brings different energy around it. A lot of people won’t just sit there and watch MMA if they don’t know about it, but if you give somebody a playoff-style anybody sits down and watches that because there’s intrigue who carries on and who moves to the next round,"" Lewis added"
"MLB requires photo ID to pick up tickets from Will Call, but boycotts Georgia for voter ID law",sports,https://www.foxnews.com//us/mlb-photo-id-tickets-georgia-voter-law," responded to calls to boycott the state of   over a controversial new voter-ID law by moving the All-Star game out of the Peach State. But teams still requires fans to show photo ID to pick up their tickets from the Will Call booth. South Carolina Republican Rep. Nancy Mace called the league out on Twitter. ""Hey @MLB, this you?"" she wrote, along with a screenshot of the Will Call policy at mlb.com The league did not respond to multiple requests for an explanation of its photo ID policy for ticket retrieval. Proponents of the move to abandon Atlanta’s Truist Park for this year’s All-Star Game have argued that Georgia’s new GOP-backed election integrity law is a form of voter suppression and is racist. President Biden even called it ""Jim Crow in the 21st Century."" Georgia’s new law comes after Democrats swept both Senate races in runoff votes and President Biden edged out former President Trump on Election Day. The Georgia election reform bill expands the number of early voting days, allows the observation of ballot counting, prohibits ballot harvesting and continues to allow voters to cast absentee ballots without an excuse, but requires proof of identification, among other measures. It also gives the State Election Board more authority over counties. Another feature would block anyone from handing out food and drink to people waiting in line to vote. The move garnered national attention, with praise from the left and criticism from the right. Former President Donald Trump called for a boycott of the national pastime and other 'woke' corporations – while former President Barack Obama praised it as a way to honor the Atlanta Braves’ most famous Hall of Famer. ""There’s no better way for America’s pastime to honor the great Hank Aaron, who always led by example,"" Obama tweeted Saturday. Gov. Brian Kemp wrote in a   Wednesday that Democrats have falsely characterized the bill he signed. ""These reforms have nothing to do with ‘voter suppression' or ‘Jim Crow’,"" he argued. ""The Election Integrity Act makes it easy to vote by expanding access to the polls and harder to cheat by ensuring the security of the ballot box."""

Adesanya apologized for the remark after facing Robertson’s condemnation. ""Last weekend fight talk escalated to a point in which I crossed the line,"" he wrote in a statement posted to Twitter. ""I understand the gravity of this word and how it can affect and hurt other people apart from my opponent, although that was NEVER my intention. I am still growing under the spotlight, and I take this as a lesson to be more selective with words under pressure."" MMA Junkie also noted that Adesanya has a history of controversial statements. The UFC 4 cover star said in February 2020 that Yoel Romero was going to ""crumble like the Twin Towers."" He also apologized for that and said he would be ""more careful"" with his future words."

UFC's Francis Ngannou wants Jon Jones next: 'I am ready',sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/ufc-francis-ngannou-jon-jones-next-i-am-ready,"After his impressive knockout victory over Stipe Miocic in the second round of   260, Francis Ngannou was crowned the new heavyweight champion on Saturday night in Las Vegas. What’s next for Ngannou? A possible date in the octagon with UFC great Jon Jones. Ngannou, who is on a five-fight winning streak, addressed what could be one of the biggest fights in the history of the sport during his post-fight press conference. He said that it ""makes the most sense for me."" ""In my opinion, Jon Jones is the greatest of all time in mixed martial arts,"" Ngannou said via  . ""Him moving up is going to be a challenge I will take. It'll be a very good challenge. ... But this time I am the champ, he is coming up and looking for me. I am ready any time soon."" Jones, who last fought in February of 2020, will need to make his debut as a heavyweight in order to fight Ngannou, after spending all of his career in the light heavyweight division. After Ngannou pulled out the incredible knockout win over Miocic, Jones took his thoughts to Twitter, addressing the rumors that he may meet ""The Predator"" in the octagon next. Jones initially tweeted, ""Let's play baby"" after the fight. But he immediately deleted it and replaced it by saying, ""Show me the money."" After UFC president Dana White said Derrick Lewis would be a possible contender to face Ngannou next, he added that the ball is in Jones’ court if he wants to fight him. White said earlier this year that Jones will take on the winner of the Miocic-Ngannou fight. ""If I'm Jon Jones and I'm home watching this fight, I start thinking of moving to [middleweight],"" White said when hearing of Jones' tweet. ""What's 'show me the money' mean? You can say you want to fight somebody – but do you really want to?"" Jones fired back at White on Twitter after hearing what he had to say. ""I quit the light heavyweight division, literally gained a massive amount of weight. And now people are saying I'm afraid?"" Jones tweeted. ""Everyone but me claiming that I'm afraid. All I asked was to get paid."" Jones continued his rant on Twitter into early Sunday morning. A potential Ngannou-Jones fight is certainly worth monitoring at the next big UFC event."
"Barzal has 3 goals, 2 assists as Islanders beat Capitals 8-4",sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/barzal-has-3-goals-2-assists-as-islanders-beat-capitals-8-4,"Mathew Barzal had three goals and two assists, Jordan Eberle scored twice, and the   beat the   8-4 Thursday night. Brock Nelson, Casey Cizikas and Josh Bailey also scored to help the Islanders improve to 14-1-2 at home and move back into a tie with Washington and Pittsburgh atop the East Division with 50 points. The Capitals have a game in hand on both the Islanders and Penguins. ""These games are fun because you’ve got two intense teams,'' Islanders coach Barry Trotz said. ""Fortunately we were able to score some goals tonight."" Semyon Varlamov made 22 saves for New York, improving to 8-3-1 in his last 12 decisions while allowing only 30 goals over that span. Varlamov is 15-7-3 overall this season. John Carlson had two goals, and T.J. Oshie and Daniel Sprong also scored for the Capitals. ""I don’t think we played hard enough to win a hockey game tonight,'' Capitals coach Peter Laviolette said. ""Certain situational things I don't think we did a very good job on. We just lost a game and gave up eight goals. You look to fix that and be better tomorrow night."" The game featured a chaotic first period, beginning during the initial minute when Washington’s starting goaltender Ilya Samsonov had to leave the ice just 30 seconds in after Oshie collided with him behind the net. Oshie’s shoulder made contact with Samsonov’s head, and the goalie skated off for precautionary reasons. Vitek Vanacek temporarily took over in the crease. ""He had to go and get checked out. He was cleared,'' Laviolette added in reference to Samsonov returning to action. ""it was his game so he was going back in."" Carlson quickly opened the scoring at 1:01, blasting Washington’s first shot past Varlamov with assists credited to Tom Wilson and Conor Sheary. Eberle tied it at 5:02, taking a cross-ice pass from Leo Komarov and rifling the puck past Vanacek. The fleet Barzal then put the Islanders ahead 2-1 with a spectacular end-to-end rush, skating through the entire Capitals on-ice quintet and finishing off the solo effort at 16:09 with a high shot past Vanacek while somehow balancing on his right skate blade. ""I knew I had I had picked it up deep and had a little bit of a step,'' the 23-year-old Barzal said. ""I felt like I had some ice that I took advantage of."" Samsonov returned with just over three minutes remaining in the period, just before Nelson scored his 13th goal at 17:32 to make it 3-1. Sprong narrowed the deficit 48 seconds later before Barzal scored again at 18:53 by sliding the puck past Samsonov from a near-impossible angle below the left faceoff circle to make it 4-2 before the first intermission. The Islanders outshot the Capitals 13-7 in the six-goal first period and had a 9-7 shots advantage in the second when the scoring continued as Cizikas made it 5-2 with his seventh goal at 3:03 before Oshie closed the deficit with a power-play goal at 6:47. Eberle then added his second goal of the night at 8:08, one-timing a pass from Barzal for his 13th before Carlson added his second of the game and ninth of the season at 19:01 of the middle period. For the Islander squad that prides itself on winning tight low-scoring games, the rare romp was a relief. ""The importance of this game was huge after dropping two to Pittsburgh. We knew we needed to win,'' Eberle said. ""When you’re scoring, it makes the game fun ... It's nice to know we can put the puck in the net. All in all, it’s two points and that’s what we needed."" Bailey scored at 3:13 of third to make it 7-4 before Barzal completed his fourth career hat trick at 18:54, swatting a puck out of the air past Samsonov as the Islanders set a season high in goals. Barzal’s five-point performance gave him a team-best 33 points through 37 games. He is tied with Eberle and Nelson for the team lead with 13 goals. ""I think aside from my three, we were just playing good hockey all night'' Barzal added. ""I think we could have had two or three more."" The Capitals had won the first three meetings this season at home, outscoring the Islanders 12-6 in that trio of victories. The teams will meet three more times on Long Island and once in Washington. Washington had won 10 of last 12 games entering the contest with the only two defeats coming against the Rangers during that span. The Islanders were 11-4-0 in March, matching the 1981-82 Stanley Cup winning squad for the most wins in March. Since becoming the coach of the Islanders before the 2018-19 season, Trotz is 5-7-0 in the regular season against the team he led to the Stanley Cup in 2018. Thursday’s win was the first in five tries at home against the Capitals in that span. The Islanders did defeat Washington in five games in last summer’s playoff bubble in Toronto. Islanders: Host Philadelphia on Saturday. Capitals: At New Jersey on Friday."

Ross Colton and Point scored 1:06 apart in the third period to erase a one-goal deficit and snap a three-game losing streak for the Lightning. ""We’ve played a lot of hockey and pucks have not been going in as easily,’’ Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. ""It’s games like this when you’re battling back and down one with six (minutes) to go ... you just have to keep working to come out of these.’’ Andrei Vasilevskiy finished with 36 saves to pick up the win. Eric Robinson and Zach Werenski scored for Columbus, which has one win in the past six games. Elvis Merzlikins finished with 31 saves for the Blue Jackets. ""I thought 99 percent of this hockey club played their (butts) off tonight,’’ Columbus coach John Tortorella said. ""I’m frustrated for the guys because I think they’ve really concentrated on how we’re trying to play right now. To get belief you need results and just to get nothing tonight ... it’s a tough one to eat.’’ Point scored the winner and his second of the game coming in on a 2-on-1 rush and as he tried to backhand a pass over to Tyler Johnson, the puck ramped off the stick of Columbus defenseman David Savard and into the net at 15:54. ""I felt like I had some jump tonight, I think our team had some jump and when we’re skating that’s when we’re creating chances,’’ Point said. ""When Columbus goes up they do a good job of shutting it down.’’ Colton tied the game 66 seconds earlier with a wrist shot from the middle of the left circle. ""I had passed up on a shot like that earlier in the game when I tried to cut to the middle,’’ Colton said. ""So that time I just wanted to get the puck on net and I was lucky that it went in."" The goal answered Robinson’s breakaway conversion at 10:54 that put Columbus in front for the first time in the game. ""It felt really good at the time,’’ Robinson said. Tampa Bay took the lead when Columbus was whistled for too many men on the ice while on the penalty kill to give the Lightning 62 seconds of a two-man advantage. Point cashed in with 15 seconds remaining on the 5-on-3 chance with a shot from the bottom of the left circle that powered its way through Merzlikins at 15:45. The Blue Jackets pushed back in the second period and found the equalizer as Werenski cut across the top of the crease to swat in a rebound off his backhand for the defenseman’s fifth of the season at 9:04 of the second period. ""We played good ... found a way to lose,’’ Werenski said. ""It’s tough right now. It’s one of those things where I thought it was one of our better hockey games and we find a way to lose again. Right now we need results.’’ Tampa Bay D Ryan McDonagh returned to the lineup after missing the previous four games with an undisclosed lower-body injury, but the Lightning remain thin on defense. Erik Cernak missed his fourth consecutive game since taking a puck off the inside of his knee on March 22 in Dallas while Jan Rutta was placed on injured reserve after leaving Tuesday’s game against Columbus with a lower-body injury. Tampa Bay called up D Ben Thomas from the Syracuse Crunch and assigned him to the taxi squad. While Columbus G Joonas Korpisalo returned to the lineup after missing three games with a lower body injury, he dressed as the backup to Elvis Merzlikins, who made his fourth consecutive start, his longest stretch this season. ""These kind of games are going to help me go where I want to go, which is up,’’ Merzlikins said. Blue Jackets: At Florida Panthers on Saturday and Sunday. Lightning: Host Detroit Red Wings on Saturday and Sunday."
"Charles Barkley says politicians exploit racial, other differences to 'keep their grasp on money and power'",sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/charles-barkley-says-politicians-exploit-racial-other-differences-to-keep-their-grasp-on-money-and-power,"Whether the topic is basketball, politics or race relations, you can always count on   to speak his mind. This time, the former   star and current TNT commentator accused   on both sides of the aisle of trying to ""keep their grasp on money and power"" by fanning the flames of division. ""I think most White people and Black people are great people. I really believe that in my heart,"" Barkley said while covering the NCAA   men's basketball tournament on Saturday. Barkley claimed the ""system is set up where our politicians, whether they’re Republicans or Democrats, are designed to make us not like each other so they can keep their grasp of money and power,"" adding that they ""divide and conquer."" He said voters are ""stupid"" to follow any politicians who spend their careers exploiting differences. ""‘Hey, let’s make these people not like each other,'"" he mocked. ""‘We don’t live in their neighborhoods, we all got money, let’s make the Whites and Blacks not like each other, let’s make rich people and poor people not like each other, let’s scramble the middle class.' I truly believe that in my heart."" The Hall of Famer, who has long been known for his outspokenness, last summer addressed the nationwide anti-racism protests following the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Barkley accused professional athletes of turning the conversation about racism into a ""circus."" ""Instead of talking about racial equality, racial justice, and economic justice, we spend all our time worrying about who’s kneeling and not kneeling, what things are being said on buses, what’s being said on jerseys,"" he said in a July interview.

Fiala's shootout goal gives Minnesota wild win in Vegas,sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/fialas-shootout-goal-gives-minnesota-wild-win-in-vegas,"Kevin Fiala scored in the shootout and the   beat the   3-2 on Thursday night. The victory snapped Minnesota’s five-game road losing streak. ""We’ve been playing so well at home, it hasn’t translated on the road,"" said Wild goaltender Cam Talbot, who played his best road game of the season, stopping 35 shots. ""Every game is a four-point game this year. Every game is a big game, and when you come into a building like this, you know you’re going to have to go through this team to make it out of our division for the playoffs. This is a tough building to play in and this gives us confidence moving forward."" Talbot, who is a perfect 7-0-0 at home and improved to 3-5-2 away from St. Paul, is now 6-1-1 with a 1.72 goals-against average and a .948 save percentage in his last eight starts. He leads NHL goalies in saves and shots against, and is tied for second in wins since March 1. Kirill Kaprizov and Jared Spurgeon scored for Minnesota. Fiala was the only skater to score in the shootout, as he banked his shot off the post and then off Vegas goaltender Robin Lehner. ""He’s a big goalie so I didn’t know what to do to be honest,"" Fiala said. ""I decided to go low block and got lucky there. Hit the post and off his pad and in. It was lucky but I’ll take it."" William Karlsson and Brayden McNabb scored for the Golden Knights. Lehner had 35 saves but dropped to 3-0-1 with just six goals allowed since his return from a concussion. Vegas couldn’t capitalize early in the overtime during a 4-on-3 power play opportunity, as Talbot turned away three shots on goal. The Wild nearly got a last-second overtime win but Kaprizov’s wrap-around was denied by Lehner. Playing with just 10 forwards on the second of back-to-back nights, missing injured Ryan Reaves and suspended Chandler Stephenson, Vegas appeared to have a little more jump off the opening puck drop than it did one night earlier in a loss to the Los Angeles Kings. It marked the first time Vegas lost consecutive home games since early last season, when it lost three in regulation from Jan. 7-11, 2020, under then-coach Gerard Gallant, and a fourth in overtime, on Feb. 8, after Peter DeBoer took over. ""I thought we handled it well, I thought it was a non-issue,"" DeBoer said of playing with a shortened roster. ""Guys are always looking for a few more minutes every night. It was nice not to have that as an issue. I thought we had a great effort. Just unfortunate we didn’t get the two points."" The one point Vegas did earn moved it into a first-place tie with Colorado, as both are atop the West with 50 points. Karlsson opened the scoring when he grabbed a loose puck and fired it over Talbot’s right shoulder, marking the first time in four games the Golden Knights scored the game’s first goal. It didn’t take long for the top-scoring rookie in the NHL to tie the game, as Kaprizov was able to get position in front of the net in time to redirect Jordan Greenway’s shot past Lehner. It was the Russian forward’s 13th goal of the season. The second period turned into a highlight reel for both goaltenders. Talbot stopped rookie Keegan Kolesar, who had a beautiful look at the top shelf but had his wrist shot robbed. Just seconds later, after a faceoff to his right, Talbot blocked Kolesar’s backhand from the doorstep. Shortly after Lehner turned away Joel Eriksson Ek’s wrist shot from the slot, it was Talbot once again, this time stopping speedy Alex Tuch on a breakaway. McNabb snapped a 66-game scoring drought when he took a pass from William Carrier and lasered a wrist shot from near the top of the right circle through traffic and past Talbot. It was McNabb’s first goal since Nov. 21, 2019, against the San Jose, when DeBoer was still in charge of the Sharks. Minnesota took advantage of a 4-on-3 situation when Spurgeon blasted a one-timer from the left circle to make it a 2-2 game. Minnesota forward Mats Zuccarello played in his 600th career game. Golden Knights defenseman Nic Hague had just six penalty minutes over his first 28 games. He’s been plagued in the sin bin the last four games, accumulating 14 penalty minutes, including four against the Wild. Stephenson served the first of a three-game suspension, handed down by the league’s player safety department for elbowing Los Angeles Kings defenseman Tobias Bjornfot on Wednesday. Stephenson will forfeit $71,120.70, all of which will go to the players' emergency assistance fund. The teams conclude their two-game set in Las Vegas on Saturday."
"Spezza scores in shootout, Maple Leafs beat Jets 2-1",sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/spezza-scores-in-shootout-maple-leafs-beat-jets-2-1,"Jason Spezza scored the only goal of the shootout to give the Toronto Maple Leafs a 2-1 victory over the Winnipeg Jets on Friday night. The veteran forward corralled a rolling puck before deking Connor Hellebuyck and tucking it in the small gap between the goaltender’s outstretched pad and the post. ""I just tried to make a good move and outwait him,"" Spezza said. ""Lucky it went in."" Kyle Connor, Pierre-Luc Dubois and Mark Scheifele were unable to beat Toronto goaltender Jack Campbell in the tiebreaker as he improved to 8-0-0 on the season. ""It’s a big goal for us and Soupy with the big three saves,"" said Maple Leafs forward Mitch Marner. ""So both sides, it’s a great result and something that we’re very happy with."" Travis Dermott scored in regulation for the North Division-leading Maple Leafs. Campbell finished with 31 saves. Toronto had several great chances to put the game away on an overtime power play, but couldn’t beat Hellebuyck, who played in his 300th career regular-season game. Andrew Copp had the lone goal for the Jets. Hellebuyck had 37 saves. ""While there wasn’t the free-flowing offense that we’ve seen in the past between Toronto and Winnipeg, there was quality offence in bursts out there where the goalies were the difference,"" said Jets head coach Paul Maurice. Zach Hyman showed some early zip for Toronto in a quiet first period. He sped around the net on his first shift and beat Hellebuyck only to watch the puck roll out just wide of the post. Campbell was steady at the other end in an opening period that had just a few decent scoring chances. Dermott snapped a puck from the point that seemed to catch Hellebuyck off guard at 5:16 of the second period. The rather innocuous one-timer knuckled its way inside the post for his second goal of the season. The Jets answered moments later after Maple Leafs defenseman Morgan Rielly pressed a bit too far at the Winnipeg blue line. Adam Lowry took advantage by racing ahead on a 2-on-1 break, feeding Copp for his 12th of the year at 11:50. Toronto’s Alex Kerfoot hit the post late in the second period and teammate Alex Galchenyuk found the iron early in the third. The Jets pressed midway in the final period, forcing Campbell to make a pair of diving saves. The Toronto goalie appeared to favor his leg after making a great stop on Connor, but shook it off and stayed in the game. ""He was just outstanding,"" Maple Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe said of Campbell. ""You can just see his confidence growing and you can see the team’s confidence in him growing as well. He was just terrific."" POWER PLAYS The Maple Leafs’ power-play woes continued as they went 0 for 3 on the night. Toronto has just one goal in its last 28 opportunities with the man advantage. Winnipeg was 0 for 2 on the power play. BEAULIEU OUT Earlier in the day, the Jets said that defenseman Nathan Beaulieu will miss the rest of the season after undergoing surgery to repair a torn labrum. SCHEDULE CHANGE The NHL announced Friday that a Jets home game against Ottawa scheduled for May 7 will be played Monday night. The change is a result of recently postponed games affecting the Jets and Vancouver Canucks. UP NEXT Maple Leafs: At Calgary on Sunday night. Jets: Host Ottawa on Monday night."
"NCAA TOURNAMENT 2021: HOW TO WIN $1,000 ON THE FINAL FOUR FOR FREE",sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/ncaa-tournament-2021-how-to-win-1000-on-the-final-four-for-free,"For the past 40 years,   has largely been ruled by teams from east of the Mississippi River. Yet this year’s Final Four has a decidedly western feel to it. This weekend, the last of the season, will see   and   tip things off at Lucas Oil Stadium on Saturday afternoon, while   and   will play the nightcap, each for a berth in Monday’s national championship game.  And the final four teams can help you  . Just answer all six questions correctly and   To get you prepared, here are the questions for Saturday’s games. How many total points will be scored in the first half of the Houston vs. Baylor game?Under 60, 60-63, 64-67, 68-71, 72-75, 76+ Nothing in the last two rounds of the tournament would indicate a high-scoring game. Baylor’s defense has been suffocating, while Houston has been subject to some shooting slumps that have held their scores down. That being said, counting on two teams being in the 20s for a Final Four game – which is what an ""Under 60"" pick would essentially mean – seems a bit extreme. The pick here would be the 64-67 range, perhaps with a late flurry at the end once the nerves dissipate. How many total points will be scored in the first half of the UCLA vs. Gonzaga game?Under 65, 65-68, 68-72, 73-75, 77-79, 80+ If UCLA is able to control the tempo, then the lower end of the spectrum could certainly be in play. However, Gonzaga hasn’t been slowed down by anyone – not just in this tournament, but for this season. The feeling here is that the 73 to 75 point range just sounds right. Which team will feature the highest-scoring player in the Round of 4? A completely healthy   would be a solid choice to win this category. The UCLA standout had one of the best performances of the tournament in the Elite Eight win over Michigan before exiting with an injured ankle for a period in the second half. Instead,   and Gonzaga have the most explosive offense in the tournament, and Timme has the chance to post a really big game on a combination of inside-outside offense against the Bruins defense. Will Gonzaga cover the closing spread on FOX Bet? As of Thursday afternoon, the Zags were – in a bit of a mixed metaphor – more than a two-touchdown favorite (14.5 points) over the Bruins. (For the record, Gonzaga hasn’t had football since 1941.) The closest game for the Zags in this tournament was a 16-point win over Oklahoma in the Round of 32.  Out of the 30 games that Gonzaga has played this season (all victories), only one was decided by single digits – an 87-82 win over West Virginia on Dec. 4th. In other words, history would really have to be altered to not cover the spread. Which two teams will be playing in the Championship game on Monday? All season long, the consensus has been that the only team that could derail Gonzaga’s attempt at matching the 1976 Indiana team as the last perfect champion was Baylor. Houston could give Baylor a game, but the feeling here is what America wants is what America is going to get. Which team will score the most points in their Round of 4 game? Again, the styles of all these teams lend to the answer to this question. Gonzaga averaged six more points per game than the next closest Final Four team (Baylor) during the regular season. In the tournament, that figure has doubled to almost 14 points over the Bears, who are second.  all tournament long for your chance to win thousands of dollars every round! "
"Bodanovic scores 26 points, Hawks beat Pelicans 126-103",sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/bodanovic-scores-26-points-hawks-beat-pelicans-126-103,"Bogdan Bodanovic scored 26 points, Kevin Huerter added 24 and five other Atlanta players scored in double figures as the short-handed Hawks beat the injury-slowed New Orleans Pelicans 126-103 on Friday night. The Hawks led 55-54 at halftime and scored 37 points in the third quarter – their highest total in that period this season – to take a 94-79 lead entering the fourth quarter. ""It was just a professional approach,"" Atlanta coach Nate McMillan said, referring to going .500 on the road trip. ""I thought we came out with a business mindset to dig down deep on this last game of a long road trip to try to win this game. ""We wanted to pretty much approach this game as if it was the fourth quarter, the last game of a road trip. We needed to dig deep to be strong and, you know, play this game. It was a collective effort by everybody."" The Pelicans played without four starters, including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram, and struggled offensively. They went 4:30 without a field goal to start the third quarter, and the Hawks took full advantage, outscoring New Orleans 28-10 to extend their lead to 83-64. Clint Capela, who finished with 14 points, 10 rebounds and six blocks, scored eight points in the quarter, and the Hawks shot 63% in the period, going 15 of 24. ""We just take it as a challenge,"" Capela said of the two weeks on the road. ""I know it’s a marathon. It’s a long journey. My head is just trying to keep up with it, do what I do, try to block out, rebound, running and just stay focused on all the things that I do best."" Huerter was held scoreless in an overtime victory over San Antonio on Thursday night but made 10 of 15 from the floor against New Orleans. ""It’s obviously a really good feeling,"" Huerter said. ""We didn’t want to go out on a sour note and this road trip, and hopefully we got some momentum going."" In his second game since being acquired by the Hawks, Lou Williams scored 19 points. Rookie Kira Lewis Jr. scored a career-high 21 points to lead New Orleans. After trailing the Pelicans 34-28 in the first quarter, the Hawks went on a 12-4 run in the second period to take a 43-40 lead, with Clint Capela scoring four points. The Hawks got 12 points from Huerter and 10 points from Bogdanoic in the first half on their way to a 55-54 lead at the break. Atlanta outscored the Pelicans 27-20 in the second quarter, holding New Orleans to 33% shooting in the period, including 1 of 8 from long range. Eric Bledsoe led the Pelicans with 10 points in the half, but he missed all four of his 3-point attempts. New Orleans was 3 of 15 from long distance. Hawks: Atlanta’s injured consisted of John Collins (ankle), Danilo Gallinari (Achilles), De’Andre Hunter (knee), Cam Reddish (Achilles), Trae Young (knee) and Kris Dunn (ankle). … Coach Nate McMillan said he supports the decision by Major League Baseball to move its All-Star Game out of Atlanta due to a new voting rights law signed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. ""I really think it’s great that they’re bringing attention to what’s happening in Georgia,"" McMillan said. ""I really don’t get it — trying to find ways to keep people from having their right to vote."" Pelicans: New Orleans injured included Zion Williamson (thumb), Brandon Ingram (toe), Lonzo Ball (hip), Steven Adams (ankle) and Josh Hart (surgery Friday on a torn UCL ligament in right thumb). … Hart, a scrappy defender and rebounder off the bench, could miss the remainder of the season. … ""Injuries are always frustrating, but they’re always part of the game,"" coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""I’ve been at this a long time and these things happen. You’ve got to be ready to play."" … Naji Marshall made his first NBA start. … Free agent PG Isaiah Thomas, who played for the Wizards last year, is expected to sign a 10-day contract.

Oklahoma hires Loyola Chicago's Moser as basketball coach,sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/oklahoma-hires-loyola-chicagos-moser-as-basketball-coach,"Porter Moser orchestrated one of the great underdog stories in sports in recent years, leading mid-major Loyola Chicago to two deep NCAA Tournament runs with the blessing of Sister Jean. Moser's teams won't surprise anyone now. Oklahoma hired Moser as its basketball coach Saturday following Lon Kruger’s retirement. Moser embraces the challenge of coaching at a Big 12 program that reached the Final Four in 2016 and has featured NBA talents Buddy Hield and Trae Young. ""I’ve always said there are reasons why you win,"" Moser said in a statement. ""If you look at the standards that the programs at Oklahoma have set, there are reasons why they’ve won. The coaches, infrastructure and community are all championship caliber. You just want to be a part of that. To play in a premier league like the Big 12 and be a part of this championship culture excites me."" Kruger led the Sooners to a 195-128 record in 10 years and reached seven of the past eight NCAA Tournaments. In Kruger’s final season at Oklahoma, the Sooners went 16-11 and finished with a loss to top-seeded Gonzaga in the second round. Moser praised Kruger and believes the foundation is set. ""He’s all about winning the right way,"" Moser said of Kruger. ""I look forward to continuing that blueprint and continuing the blueprint we had at Loyola: winning the right way. I’m thrilled to join a program that is so focused on culture, people and excellence. I’m looking forward to diving in and building relationships with our players, the other coaches and the OU community."" Oklahoma athletic director Joe Castiglione said Moser’s ""attributes, acumen and record of success totally aligned with what we were seeking."" ""He’s a purposeful and proven leader who prioritizes positive culture, accountability, academics, player development, innovation, transparent communication and a holistic approach to the student-athlete experience,"" Castiglione added. Moser led Loyola to the Final Four in 2018 and the Sweet 16 this year. He went 188-141 in 10 years at Loyola and has a 293-242 record in 17 seasons as a college head coach, with stops at Arkansas-Little Rock (2000-03) and Illinois State (2003-07).  ""It is impossible to properly thank Porter for all he’s done for our basketball program and University,"" Loyola athletic director Steve Watson said. ""His vision and leadership brought Loyola to new heights and Ramblers everywhere will be eternally grateful."" The Ramblers went 32-6 in their Final Four season and charmed the nation in an unexpected run buoyed by one last-second shot after another. Along the way, their 98-year-old nun and team chaplain, Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt, became a celebrity, with bobbleheads and athletic apparel and national TV interviews. The Ramblers beat Miami, Tennessee, Nevada and Kansas State to reach the national semifinal, where they lost to Michigan. Loyola made another run this year, led by the nation’s stingiest scoring defense. The Ramblers went 26-5 in their fourth straight year with 20 or more wins. They earned their first AP Top 25 ranking since 1985 and won the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament for the second time in four years. Sister Jean, now 101 and fully vaccinated, was on hand for the NCAA Tournament this year. She watched in Indianapolis as Loyola beat ACC Tournament champion Georgia Tech and dominated top-seeded Illinois in the second round before falling to Oregon State."
"MLB boycotts Georgia, signs new deal with Chinese firm that dropped NBA over exec’s Hong Kong support",sports,https://www.foxnews.com//us/mlb-georgia-tencent-nba-hong-kong," is protesting a democratically passed   voting law while bolstering ties with a Communist Party-backed   company that cracked down on an NBA executive who supported the pro-democracy movement in  . ""Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box,"" league commissioner   said announcing the decision to pull this year’s All-Star Game out of the Peach State Friday. He said protesting Georgia’s new GOP-backed election integrity law was ""the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport."" But the MLB signed a deal with Tencent Wednesday, one of China’s largest tech companies. It’s one of the Chinese firms that briefly dropped NBA games in 2019 after former Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey publicly voiced support for pro-democracy protesters facing a Beijing-backed crackdown in Hong Kong. The new deal grants Tencent rights to stream MLB games in a number of Asian countries until 2023. Back in 2018, the MLB and Tencent reached another deal that granted the company streaming rights for 125 games within China. Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio slammed the move. ""@MLB caves to pressure & moves draft & #AllStarGame out of Georgia on the same week they announce a deal with a company backed by the genocidal Communist Party of #China,"" he tweeted. ""Why are we still listening to these woke corporate hypocrites on taxes, regulations & anti-trust?"" Critics have accused the league of caving to corporate sponsors and owners. And although the league said it asked for players’ feedback in its announcement Friday, it’s unclear that officials had warned ballplayers of a final decision before announcing it. Aubrey Huff, a former player whose 12-year career included two World Series wins with the San Francisco Giants, said players and other team employees were ""blindsided"" by the move and said some were ""pissed."" ""@MLB sold out to the corporate elites (without consulting with players) threatening millions in sponsorship dollars unless they moved all-star game from Atlanta,"" he claimed on Twitter. The conflicting deals raise questions about whether the league is making an effort to take a moral stand or to achieve maximum profits. Atlanta’s home team, the Braves, said in a statement that it is ""deeply disappointed"" by the choice. ""Unfortunately, businesses, employees and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision,"" the team said."
Former Johnnies' star quarterback Jackson Erdmann working toward NFL dream with Minnesota Pro Day appearance,sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/johnnies-quarterback-jackson-erdmann-nfl-minnesota-pro-day,"Former St. John’s University quarterback Jackson Erdmann is carving out his path to the pros and on Thursday, he made his debut at the   Pro Day where more than 50 representatives from 31   teams got the chance to see just what Johnnies’ star was all about.  Erdmann, 24, spoke exclusively with Fox News on Friday about his performance at the Gophers’ Pro Day, just a year after the coronavirus pandemic put his hopes of making it to the NFL on hold.  ""It was a little disruption in the plans as far as the canceled Pro Day, minicamps, CFL season, so the last year … I was kind of in limbo,"" he explained. ""I was training, working out with guys just hoping for a shot ... This year I was actually able to get into the Pro Day because they had it."" Erdmann was eligible for the   last year but he said coming from an NCAA Divison III school meant that he would need to play in front of teams to make an impression -- without a platform to showcase his skills, he wasn’t picked up.  ""For me especially, my feedback as a D-III quarterback coming out of school, it was like ‘okay, he’s got good film. He’s got good stats and everything but we just have to see him in person, being D-III seeing if he looks like he does on tape’ … that’s why the Pro Day was so big for me last year.""  He continued: ""I was really disappointed last year when it ended up being canceled. I was supposed to be throwing Tyler Johnson (  wideout) and a couple of other guys, so that was disappointing for sure."" Erdmann was redshirted his first year at   where he was a preferred walk-on before deciding to transfer to SJU, which would ultimately give him the opportunity to play as well as he did.  ""Traditionally [Penn State’s] been pro-style offense and they actually made a switch on offensive coordinator when I was there and they were kind of molding the offense around Saquan (Barkley) and moving into a dual-threat offense with Trace McSorley and Tommy Stevens … and [I thought] this doesn’t fit my strength and abilities as much and I can’t showcase myself.""  Erdmann earned a number of awards as the Johnnies starter and was named the 2018 Gagliardi Trophy recipient as the NCAA Division III's most outstanding player -- the equivalent of the Heisman Trophy for D1 athletes. In his senior year alone, he threw for 5,040 passing yards and 47 touchdowns.  Despite the setback, he would join the Fan Controlled Football league in 2021, where he would win the championship game as the Wild Aces signal-caller in the league’s inaugural season.  Erdman was back on track with Thursday’s appearance and he certainly caught the attention of several scouts. ""I spoke to a couple,"" he recalled. ""I was throwing pretty much the whole time … but a couple came up to me and were like ‘Hey, I remember you … you looked good. You’ve developed a lot over this last year."" Erdman said that he spoke to Gophers head coach P.J. Fleck who told him that several team representatives came up to him asking: ""Who the heck is this guy, where did he come from?"" ""It was great hearing the scouts’ feedback yesterday like, ‘Hey, you’ve developed well,’"" Erdmann added. ""I put on some weight since college and I’ve been able to develop a stronger arm and just learn more."" He said he also spoke to the   reps who were present on Thursday, after developing a relationship with them last year. Erdmann shares the same agency as several members of the Vikings and was able to train with some over the summer to bring his game up to speed.  ""It was a great learning experience for me. I was able to develop a lot, too,"" he said. Erdmann was also able to throw to first-round hopeful Rashod Bateman during Thursday’s Pro Day.  ""We’ve thrown this past summer and fall a little bit together. So we have that chemistry,"" he said. ""We have a great relationship. He’s a great person, we get along well …  We were on the same page for a lot of [the day]. I thought we were clicking pretty well for the Pro Day, so that was exciting."" Erdmann said he’s hopeful that rookie minicamps won’t get canceled this year but all he needs is one opportunity to prove himself.  ""I’m excited for the future,"" he added. ""It was awesome for me to be seen and be in front of some scouts and just show them what I can do and it only takes one team for them to give me a chance and show them what I can do and show everyone what I can do."""
Houston police says it's investigating Texans QB Watson,sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/houston-police-says-its-investigating-texans-qb-watson," quarterback Deshaun Watson, who is accused of sexual assault and harassment in lawsuits filed by 21 women, is being investigated by police after a report was filed regarding the NFL player, officials said Friday. In a  , the Houston Police Department said a complainant had filed a report with the agency about Watson. ""As with any allegation, the Houston Police Department is now conducting an investigation and will not comment further during the investigative process,"" the law enforcement agency said. Watson’s attorney, Rusty Hardin, has called the allegations ""meritless"" and has questioned the claims made against the NFL player, alleging they were made following a failed attempt   his client for $30,000. ""We welcome this long overdue development. Now we will learn the identity of at least one accuser. We will fully cooperate with the Houston Police Department,"" Hardin said Friday in a statement.

Tony Buzbee, who represents the 21 women, did not immediately return an email seeking comment Friday. The women, in   filed in state court in Houston, accuse Watson of exposing himself, touching them with his penis or kissing them against their will while he got a massage. At least one woman has alleged Watson forced her to perform oral sex during a massage in December. All of the women who have sued Watson are either licensed massage therapists or worked in a spa or similar business. Earlier this week, Hardin offered statements from 18 different women who said they had worked with Watson and he had ""never made them feel uncomfortable or demanded anything outside the scope of a professional massage."" The complaint filed with Houston police comes after Buzbee earlier this week had said he would not provide evidence to Houston police but would ""go elsewhere to provide our evidence to investigative authorities"" because of concerns about the agency. Buzbee had alleged Houston police would not fairly investigate the cases because of criticism he had made of the recently departed police chief and because Hardin’s son works for the agency. Hardin called Buzbee’s concerns about Houston police ""ludicrous."" The NFL has said it’s   the allegations against Watson. Watson is one of the league’s top quarterbacks and led the NFL in yards passing last season. He signed a four-year, $156 million contract extension with the Texans last offseason, but he became unhappy with the direction of the team as Houston sunk to 4-12. Watson  in January."

Trump asserted that MLB’s leadership was ""afraid of the Radical Left Democrats,"" claiming the party pressured the league to relocate its mid-summer game because of  ’s new election law, recently signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. The former president also took aim at large ""woke"" corporations that issued statements against the Georgia law. ""Baseball is already losing tremendous numbers of fans,"" Trump wrote, ""and now they leave Atlanta with their All-Star Game because they are afraid of the Radical Left Democrats who do not want voter I.D., which is desperately needed, to have anything to do with our elections. ""Boycott baseball,"" Trump urged, ""and all of the woke companies that are interfering with Free and Fair Elections. Are you listening Coke, Delta, and all!"" Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama on Saturday praised the MLB's move, saying it's a fitting way to honor former Braves Hall of Famer Hank Aaron, who broke down racial barriers during his storied career. ""Congratulations to [MLB] for taking a stand on behalf of voting rights for all citizens,"" Obama tweeted Saturday. ""There’s no better way for America’s pastime to honor the great Hank Aaron, who always led by example."" President Biden, who called the new GOP voting law ""sick"" and ""Jim Crow on steroids,"" also supported moving the July game from the Braves' home field of Atlanta’s Truist Park to another location. The new Georgia law prohibits electioneering within several dozen feet of a polling station, requires identification to register for an absentee ballot and expands weekend early voting. But during an appearance Friday night on Fox News’ ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" Kemp asserted that election laws in New York -- home to MLB’s headquarters – remained ""stricter"" than those in Georgia. ""When you look at New York's voting laws, you have to have an excuse to vote absentee by-mail in New York. You do not in Georgia,""  . Trump has never shied from taking on the major sports leagues, despite their legions of fans. During his presidency, Trump repeatedly hammered the NFL for allowing   along its sidelines prior to games, and last year labeled the NBA   after several teams called off playoff games in protest of police brutality. Trump has also characterized the NBA as being  , claiming the basketball league has favored its own overseas profits over supporting pro-democratic policies. In a separate statement Friday, Trump directed his ire at the ""Fake News Media"" over their framing of the 2020 presidential election results. ""Why is it that every time the 2020 ELECTION FRAUD is discussed, the Fake News Media consistently states that such charges are baseless, unfounded, unwarranted, etc?"" Trump asked.  ""Sadly,"" he continued, ""there was a massive fraud in the 2020 Presidential Election, and many very angry people understand that. With each passing day, and unfortunately for the Radical Left CRAZIES, more and more facts are coming out. Democrat Joe Biden was declared the winner of last year’s presidential election, drawing more than 81 million votes versus Trump’s more than 74 million.  Trump and many of his supporters have complained about alleged late-night ballot drops in Democrat-controlled districts and allegedly faulty voting machines, but their arguments largely failed to gain traction in the courts.  ""Other than that,"" Trump concluded, ""Happy Easter!"""

"Reds scrap with Cards at plate, tangle in outfield, win 9-6",sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/reds-scrap-with-cards-at-plate-tangle-in-outfield-win,"Nick Castellanos stood over, flexed and jawed at St. Louis pitcher Jake Woodford after scoring, setting off a series of scuffles that included relievers shoving in the outfield as the Cincinnati Reds beat the Cardinals 9-6 Saturday. St. Louis starter Adam Wainwright was knocked around for six runs and chased in the third. The next inning, the teams started tagging each other. ""Our whole group was in there, fast and furious,"" Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said. Castellanos, who homered on opening day and hopped out of the box before tossing his bat, was plunked by Woodford with two outs and none on in the fourth. Castellanos retrieved the ball and offered to toss it back to Woodford before flipping it out of play. A wild pitch soon sent Castellanos scampering home from third and he scored with a headfirst slide for a 7-2 lead as he bumped into Woodford, who took the throw from catcher Yadier Molina at the plate. Castellanos said it was raw emotion in the moment after he scored and wasn't trying to incite Woodford, who had put him on base with a fastball to the ribs. Woodford said it wasn't intentional. ""I’m not out here to disrespect nobody or whatever, but I want to win,"" Castellanos said.  Said Shildt: ""There is no need to stand over somebody and taunt somebody."" As Castellanos began walking away, Molina rushed up and tapped him from behind, and the benches and bullpens emptied in a wild scene. ""It’s just him playing hard, being a competitor, and we’ve got his back,"" said Tucker Barnhart, whose two-run homer ignited a six-run third for the Reds. There was more pushing and shoving before order seemed to be restored. But as relief pitchers for both teams were heading back to their bullpens, they tangled in the outfield. Castellanos was the only player ejected. Aristides Aquino replaced Castellanos and led off the sixth inning with a home run. Umpire crew chief Jim Reynolds said Castellanos was ejected because after sliding into home, he ""re-engaged the pitcher in unnecessary fashion."" Tyler Mahle (1-0) struck out nine in five innings, allowing two earned runs. Paul DeJong hit two solo home runs for St. Louis. Nolan Arenado connected for his first home run with the Cardinals. Wainwright (0-1) lasted only 2 2/3 innings and gave up five earned runs and seven hits. Back in 2010, the Cardinals and Reds got into a major brawl at Cincinnati. Molina and Brandon Phillips began barking at the plate and eventually Reds pitcher Johnny Cueto got pinned against the backstop and tried to kick his way out. Castellanos said Molina told him Woodford hadn't thrown at him intentionally. The Reds outfielder said he respects the longtime star Cardinals catcher enough to believe him.  ""That guy could have punched me in the face, and I'd still ask him for a signed jersey,"" Castellanos said. Cardinals: OF Harrison Bader (right forearm), RHP Dakota Hudson (elbow), LHP Kwang Hyun Kim (back) and RHP Miles Mikolas (right shoulder) are on the 10-day disabled list. Reds: CF Nick Senzel didn't start after hurting his left shoulder making a diving catch in Thursday's opener. Tyler Naquin started in his place, but Senzel came into the game in the fifth inning as part of a double switch. Manager David Bell said OF Shogo Akiyama (hamstring) and RHP Sonny Gray (back) will soon report to the alternate site in Louisville, Kentucky, to continue their rehab.  The Cardinals send RHP Carlos Martinez to the mound to face Reds right-hander Jeff Hoffman on Sunday in the finale of the three-game series."
"USA TODAY op-ed says NFL, NBA and NCAA should also boycott Georgia over voting law",sports,https://www.foxnews.com//media/usa-today-op-ed-says-nfl-nba-and-ncaa-should-also-boycott-georgia-over-voting-law,"A new o  in USA Today calls on the  ,   and   to boycott   over controversial changes to the state's  . In the piece, USA Today Sports Race and Inequality Editor Mike Freeman commends  ball Commissioner Robert Manfred's decision to  . ""If you want to know what courage looks like, look at Major League Baseball right now. They saw the naked, jingoistic racism of voter suppression in Georgia, and in response, decided to move this year's All-Star game from the state,"" Freeman  , later adding the move is ""what guts look like.""  In turn, Freeman blasted the ""cowardice"" of the Atlanta Braves organization, which released a statement Friday saying they were ""deeply disappointed"" by the MLB decision and were ""saddened"" that their fans would not be able to enjoy the July game. ""The Braves organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to enhance the discussion,"" they wrote.  ""Unfortunately, businesses, employees, and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision,"" the Braves said. Freeman said he was surprised the Braves were ""able to use a laptop with their fingers shaking so much from fear of the voting suppression extremists"" and called their press release a textbook definition of the phrase ""tone deaf."" He also hit at the Braves' assertion that Atlanta has ""always been known as a uniter in divided times,"" writing that their claim ""shows a level of historical ignorance that is stunning from people who should know better."" ""Atlanta may have been the center of the   but to say it has always been a 'uniter' is a farce,"" said Freeman. ""No city in the South has always been a 'uniter.'  ."" It is notable that the Braves have come under fire before, announcing they   last summer amid a   about racially insensitive logos and monikers. However, they said they would review the chant known as the   and   near an entrance to Truist Park with the team slogan ""Chop On,"" changing it to ""For The A"" ahead of the 2020 season. A tomahawk -- which looks similar to a hatchet -- was traditionally used by Native Americans as a tool, a weapon and was  . The Braves statement included a Braves logo with a tomahawk insignia.  In addition, Freeman said the Braves' position was ""acceptance of the racism of the new voting restrictions enacted by  ."" He said the issue had no ambiguity: ""There's no other way to look at it. Either you are for democracy or you are not."" Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp   that he would be ""glad"" to discuss any issues with the new voting law and that all MLB or other organizations had to do was pick up the phone. He also argued that pushback from  , Georgia activist Stacey Abrams and others on the   was a ""  play,"" a reversal of their previous position and did not actually address any of the specifics of the changes.  ""But, you know, the end result was not because it went through the process. We worked with the   and the   with reasonable people, got things in there to provide even more access, but also just make sure that in Georgia it's easy to vote and hard to cheat,"" Kemp said. ""And, I guess they don't agree with that."" He also called it "" "" -- which Freeman deems ""coded language."" Georgia's new legislation places new restrictions on voting by mail, adds voter ID requirements and limits ballot drop boxes. It also mandates two Saturdays of early voting ahead of general elections, an increase from just one, and leaves two Sundays as optional. Lastly, it bans outside groups from handing out food or water to those waiting in line to vote.  Biden has called the law   and   and Abrams reprimanded Republicans for prioritizing ""making it harder for people of color to vote over the   well-being of all Georgians."" ""As I have stated, I respect boycotts, although I don't want to see Georgia families hurt by lost events and jobs. Georgians targeted by voter suppression will be hurt as opportunities go to other states,"" she wrote  . ""We should not abandon the victims of GOP malice and lies -- we must stand together."" ""This is an existential crisis and the Braves failed to meet the moment,"" Freeman wrote in his op-ed. ""But Manfred did and his actions can be a call to action for everyone."" He said Manfred gave sports leagues and businesses a ""roadmap"" on how to fight back against the legislation, noting that ""only baseball has demonstrated the proper amount of guts."" ""The   could take similar steps by moving some of its games. The  , too. The NFL could easily, and I mean easily, declare it will never hold a   in Atlanta until voting rights are restored. The SEC could do the same with its championship game,"" Freeman suggested.  ""It is true that such boycotts would financially impact some working people of Atlanta like concession stand workers and businesses that thrive off the crowds attending the games,"" he said. ""But those same people are having their access to voting diminished with a bevy of suppression laws."" Freeman said the new restrictions in the Republican-sponsored legislation are ""draconian"" and, echoing Biden, ""un-American in every way.""  ""Manfred did the right thing in fighting these laws. Every sport, every business in the country, could learn from what Manfred did. They could also learn from the Braves, on what not to do. On what gutlessness looks like,"" he concluded. Social media reaction to Freeman's call to arms has been mixed, largely along party lines. ""An outstanding piece here,"" former Canadian Football League player  .  ""...have a feeling the 29 other teams would have released a similar statement,""  .  ""Yup. And one more reason to hate the racism endorsing @Braves,""  . ""Let me first say that I am a lifelong ⁦@Braves⁩ fan. They are my team. Forever. This is a harsh takedown of the team’s management, but it’s criticism that, in my humble opinion, they deserve to face at the moment,"" wrote Georgia native @BrysonUtd. Republican   Rep. Mo Brooks tweeted Saturday: ""Who is racist? Those who support election laws that apply equally to all & promote honest & accurate elections? Or those who act as if African Americans are inferior & need 'special help' to follow laws no other race has problems with? Oppose racism!!!"" ""The 'race and inequality' editor of the sports section of USA today thinks the NFL, NBA and NCAA should follow MLB's lead,"" Real Clear Politics co-founder Tom Bevan said. ""Sure it will hurt working people and destroy businesses, but that's a price he seems eagerly willing to pay."" In his own tweets responding to the reaction, Freeman wrote that ""Right wingers"" were ""big mad"" over the column -- telling him to ""Get f****d"" and lose his job and that he was getting called names and ""being told to stay out of Georgia.""  ""No,"" he replied. Freeman declined a request for comment from Fox News. The Atlanta Braves organization did not immediately respond."
Baylor tops Houston in Final Four round to advance to NCAA Tournament championship game,sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/baylor-tops-houston-in-final-four-round-to-advance-to-ncaa-tournament-championship-game,"The top-seeded   defeated the   78-59 in the semifinal round of the NCAA   tournament on Saturday night to advance to the championship game for the first time since 1948. Baylor breezed through its first Final Four appearance since 1950 and will head into the championship game where the Bears will take on the winner of the  -  semifinal game.   The Bears dominated the first half of the game, heading into halftime 45-28 as the Cougars struggled to find their defensive footing.  Houston had been holding teams to 55.8 points and 39% shooting through four tournament games while not allowing a team to score more than 61 points but they didn’t stand a chance against Baylor’s elite guards and its wealth of 3-point shooters.  The Bears finished shooting 53% and made 11 of 24 3-pointers, with Jared Butler leading the attack, despite not scoring in the second half.  The only highlight for Houston was sophomore Marcus Sasser's team-carrying offensive performance in the opening half, with him scoring 17 of his 20 points while the rest of the team went a combined 1 of 15 from the field. It was a brutal finish to the journey for a team that had reached the program's first Final Four since 1984. The Bears move on to the championship game where they’ll face Gonzaga, the overall No. 1 seed, or UCLA on Monday night for their first national championship. ""That was one of my goals, to leave a legacy at Baylor,"" Butler said after the game. ""And you have to win national championships. You have to win. You have to be a great program, be about great things, and that's what we're doing."""

""This was neither our decision, nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city,"" the statement read. ""The Braves organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to enhance the discussion. Our city has always been known as a uniter in divided times and we will miss the opportunity to address issues that are important to our community."" ""Unfortunately, businesses, employees and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision."" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred made the   Friday in response to the mounting pressure to change the location of the July game in response to Republican-backed election reform legislation recently signed by Gov. Brian Kemp.   ""Over the last week, we have engaged in thoughtful conversations with Clubs, former and current players, the Players Association, and the Players Alliance, among others, to listen to their views,"" he said in a statement. ""Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box,"" he continued. ""Fair access to voting continues to have our game’s unwavering support.""  The league did not announce a new location, but Manfred said they were working to finalize a new host city.  The Braves response was ill-received by some who called the message tone-deaf.  Gov. Kemp said on Friday that he spoke to the Braves organization about their stance on the All-Star Game."

The Zags won on a Hail Mary three-point buzzer beater inside the halfcourt logo by freshman Jalen Suggs. ""Every day in shootaround before the game we shoot half-courters,"" Suggs said. ""I haven’t been making my half-courters, but I got it with confidence, put it up. It’s crazy. I can’t come to words right now."" It was a tense game that saw nearly 20 lead changes and 11 ties but the undefeated Zags had the edge going into the second half after establishing a one-point lead when senior Corey Kispert hit a 3-pointer in the final seconds of the first half. Gonzaga kept the lead to start the second half but the No. 11 seed UCLA was able to narrow the score in the final minutes as both teams went point-for-point.  The Bruins were arguably the Bulldogs' biggest challenger -- they entered this Final Four with four straight double-digit victories in the NCAA Tournament. Gonzaga brought a 30-0 record into the game and is trying to become the first team since Indiana State in 1979 to carry an undefeated record into the national title game.  Standing in their way will be the   who dominated the   78-59 earlier in the day to reach its first championship game since 1948."

"Trump, Biden, Fauci, Birx: Why finger-pointing is surging as COVID-19 cases rise",politics,https://www.foxnews.com//media/trump-biden-fauci-birx-why-finger-pointing-is-surging-as-covid-19-cases-rise,"Just as more Americans are getting vaccines, two fierce battles have broken out about Covid-19—one about the current danger and the other about the last administration. It often seems that our political war over the pandemic consumes more energy than fighting the virus itself. And people are understandably confused about the nature of the tunnel we’re in and whether we can see any light at its end. President Biden is once again pleading with people against a premature declaration of victory. And former president Trump is denouncing two of his top medical advisers for criticizing his handling of the crisis, as part of an effort to salvage their own reputations. All this is unfolding as the director of the Centers for Disease Control is warning of ""impending doom."" While there is much reason for hope, says Rochelle Walensky, ""right now, I’m scared."" Scared of a fourth wave of the virus in the next couple of months before a majority of the country is vaccinated. And, by implication, scared of governors, especially Republicans, lifting mask mandates and business restrictions. ""Please, this is not politics—reinstate the mandate,"" Biden said. But of course, these are political decisions, balancing health risks and the need to revive the economy. But the argument over what to do now rests in part on how we got here, 550,000 American deaths later. Trump issued a blistering statement about Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, former leaders of his virus task force, ""two self-promoters trying to reinvent history to cover for their bad instincts and faulty recommendations… if it were up to them we’d currently be locked in our basements as our country suffered through a financial depression."" The former president was triggered, to use a woke term, by Birx’s interview in a CNN documentary, and the continuing media blitz by Fauci, who is now Biden’s top Covid adviser. But Trump, as is his wont, went well beyond policy to rip the doctors personally. He said that Birx, a ""terrible medical adviser,"" is ""a proven liar with very little credibility left. Many of her recommendations were viewed as ""pseudo-science,"" and Dr. Fauci would always talk negatively about her and, in fact, would ask not to be in the same room with her."" Trump also cited an incident when Birx went to visit family on Thanksgiving after urging the public not to travel. As for Fauci, Trump remains fixated on the 78-year-old having thrown out a lousy first pitch at a Washington Nationals game. Fauci ""said he was an athlete in college but couldn’t throw a baseball even close to home plate, it was a ‘roller.’"" He also said Fauci had done a ""fake"" interview on CNN—I don’t know, I saw him on camera—and that ""the king of ‘flip-flops’ and moving the goalposts to make himself look as good as possible."" So what did the two of them say? Birx told CNN there was an ""excuse"" for the first 100,00 deaths from the original surge, but ""all of the rest of them, in my mind, could have been mitigated or decreased substantially."" She said she had a ""very uncomfortable"" call with Trump last summer after warning about the virus on the network and was told she had to stay off national TV ""because the president might see it."" Birx is drawing enormous flak for speaking out now, when it’s too late, rather than challenging Trump when she had some authority. Some say she should have quit, though it’s not clear what that would have accomplished. Fauci told CNN that Birx should have done more but was in a difficult situation. Fauci is seen as having diplomatically battled the president last year and has been through many of these cycles. After the infection disease expert did a ""60 Minutes"" interview last October, Trump called him a ""disaster"" and said ""people are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots."" Today, by contrast, Biden backs Walensky when she says things like ""impending doom."" But is it impending? The plateau period is over. The seven-day average of new cases topped 63,000 for the first time in nearly a month, says the Washington Post. In nine states, the jump has been more than 40 percent in two weeks, says the New York Times. Michigan alone has seen a 57 rise in Covid cases, and a 47 percent increase in hospitalizations, in the past week. I have no doubt that much of this is tied to the warmer weather, spring break gatherings and pent-up frustrations over the past year. Virus variants may also be a factor, as well as states such as Michigan easier limits on business activity. In short, it would be a shame after a year of isolation and lockdown if we had another surge just as enough vaccines are becoming available to protect most Americans by May or June. But there are tradeoffs, as there have been since the dawn of the pandemic. In the end, Biden—and the governors—will be judged on how they handle this crucial period, just as Trump and his advisers were judged on 2020."
"Media root for Biden’s massive infrastructure plan, casting him as FDR",politics,https://www.foxnews.com//media/media-root-for-bidens-massive-infrastructure-plan-casting-him-as-fdr,"Hey, is it finally Infrastructure Week? It’s not the sexiest topic, certainly not compared to the bizarre Matt Gaetz investigation or even the Biden dog biting someone again after a stint in reeducation camp. That’s why it became a running joke during the Trump administration, when plans to highlight such an initiative kept getting overshadowed by some controversy or scandal. But President Biden made it the centerpiece of a Pittsburgh speech yesterday, unveiling a plan that will cost, oh, more than $2 trillion—more, in other words, than his just-passed Covid relief bill. Now I’m a fan of infrastructure projects, which help communities, create jobs and can be popular with both parties in a bringing-home-the-bacon kind of way. But the passage of this bill is a crapshoot. Yet some major news outlets are absolutely swooning. Take this headline  : ""With an Eye on History, Biden Moves on Big, Bold and Progressive Infrastructure Package."" Doesn’t that sound like it’s ripped from a White House press release? The piece begins: ""Every day he works from the Oval Office, President Joe Biden stares across from his desk at the portrait of Franklin Delano Roosevelt he selected to hang above his fireplace."" In case you missed the point: ""Biden hopes to model the more transformational change offered by his acronym'd 20th-century predecessors, FDR and LBJ…He envisions a moment--one where a country ravaged by the pandemic has seen fragilities in the economy exacerbated to a level of unseen hardship--where he can usher in a transformative era…Biden is deeply conscious that it is now his moment to step up."" Do you have the vague impression that CNN is rooting for the president? Okay, it’s historic, it’s filled with goodies, it has echoes of the New Deal. But it’s a massive amount of money and may not pass. The  uses a torrent of statistics to spotlight the plan’s benefits, from mass transit and Amtrak to broadband. That ""would translate into 20,000 miles of rebuilt roads, repairs to the 10 most economically important bridges in the country, the elimination of lead pipes and service lines from the nation’s water supplies and a long list of other projects intended to create millions of jobs in the short run and strengthen American competitiveness in the long run. ""Biden administration officials said the proposal...would also accelerate the fight against climate change by hastening the shift to new, cleaner energy sources, and would help promote racial equity in the economy…The scale of the proposal underscores how fully Mr. Biden has embraced the opportunity to use federal spending to address longstanding social and economic challenges in a way not seen in half a century."" That’s an LBJ reference, if you didn’t do the math. Not until the seventh paragraph does the Times inject this note of reality: ""While spending on roads, bridges and other physical improvements to the nation’s economic foundations has always had bipartisan appeal, Mr. Biden’s plan is sure to draw intense Republican opposition, both for its sheer size and for its reliance on corporate tax increases to pay for it."" Which could, of course, sink the whole thing. Contrast that article with the  . Its headline says: ""White House Unveils $2 Trillion Infrastructure and Climate Plan, Setting Up Giant Battle Over Size and Cost of Government."" At least that gets across there’s a major fight that has two sides. By the third paragraph, the Post cautions: ""The administration’s promises are vast and may prove difficult to enact, even if the effort can get through Democrats’ extremely narrow majority in Congress."" Look, with a 50-50 Senate, Biden can’t pass anything of this scale, even through reconciliation, unless Joe Manchin agrees. And the key question is how to pay for it. Not everyone on the Hill is excited about raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. The White House was smart to put out the details before Biden’s speech and frame the issue in advance. But that doesn’t mean the media have to pile on the FDR references and help sell the bill."
"Biden uses ESPN to slam Georgia voting law, wants All-Star Game moved",politics,https://www.foxnews.com//media/biden-uses-espn-to-slam-georgia-voting-law-wants-all-star-game-moved,"Barack Obama went on ESPN to unveil his March Madness brackets. Donald Trump regularly attacked NFL players for their anthem protests. And now Joe Biden is taking a swing at it. In an interview on ESPN’s ""Sports Center,"" Biden made news by backing efforts to move the All-Star Game out of Atlanta as a protest against Georgia’s new voting law. It’s striking that co-host Sage Steele chose to ask about the controversial law, which Biden described as ""Jim Crow on steroids."" In the past, ESPN has drawn flak for being too political and too liberal, particularly when it came to Trump. Former host Jemele Hill caused an uproar when she attacked the former president as a white supremacist. But there is an effort by the baseball players’ union to use the All-Star Game to punish Georgia, whose restrictions on voting and ID requirements for mail ballots were signed into law last week by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. So Steele may have had little choice but to raise a controversy in which politics and sports had already melded. While Trump, a onetime USFL team owner, was often at odds with pro athletes—some of whom refused to make the traditional White House visit when they won a championship—Biden is eager to side with the players. ""I think today’s professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly. I would strongly support them doing that,"" he told the network. ""People look to them. They’re leaders."" There is some precedent, as the NBA moved its All-Star Game out of Charlotte in 2017 to protest a North Carolina law limiting anti-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people. In setting up another question for the president, Steele noted that Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has repealed his state’s mask mandate. He asked about the decision by the Texas Rangers to allow its stadium to be filled to capacity for its home opener Monday—more than 40,000 people--although masks would be required except when eating. ""That’s a decision they made,"" said Biden. ""I think it’s a mistake. They should listen to Dr. Fauci and the scientists and the experts, but I think it’s not responsible."" Most baseball franchises are limiting attendance. In the latest sign that MLB isn’t any more immune from this virus this season than the last one, yesterday’s Washington Nationals game against the New York Mets was postponed after five people in the Nats organization tested positive for Covid. Trump made his attacks on pro football players into part of the culture wars. In one tweet four years ago, he pulled a page from ""The Apprentice"": ""If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU’RE FIRED. Find something else to do!"" Another time, the 45th president wrote: ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b**** off the field right now. Out! He's fired. He's fired.’"" Trump also told Mike Pence to leave an Indianapolis Colts game if a number of players took a knee, which the vice president did. And Trump taunted the league when the ratings declined. Also in 2017, Trump withdrew a White House invitation to the champion Golden State Warriors after Steph Curry and others criticized him. The team visited Obama instead. It’s hardly shocking that Biden, a self-proclaimed ""union guy,"" would back the baseball players’ union. The All-Star controversy was also a slow pitch over the plate for him, given his repeated denunciations of the Georgia voting law. But Biden is unlikely to insert himself into numerous sports controversies. Meanwhile, Georgia politicians are also taking a baseball bat to major corporations. After Delta’s CEO slammed the voting law as ""unacceptable,"" the state House passed a bill repealing the airline’s tax break on jet fuel."
"Biden adviser Brian Deese tells 'Fox News Sunday' economy still has 'long way to go,' needs new spending plan",politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/fox-news-sunday-brian-deese-interview-biden-spending-infrastructure-plan,"National   Council Director Brian Deese said Sunday that   new spending plan is still sorely needed despite a strong March jobs report and a variety of other positive economic signs in recent months.  Deese, the architect of Biden's ""American Jobs Plan,"" told "" "" anchor Chris Wallace that compared to before the pandemic, the United States is still behind. He said the president's $2 trillion-plus spending plan could help get the U.S. economy back to where it was in early 2020.  ""The jobs numbers in March were certainly a welcome sign. It's good to see the economy starting to improve, and we certainly think it's a sign that the economic and vaccination strategy that this administration has put into place from Day One is starting to have an impact,"" Deese said. ""But we have a long way to go,"" he added. ""We still are down 8.4 million jobs from where we were a year ago. We have millions of people out of work. More than 2 million women have left the labor force because they've had to choose between caring for their family members and their jobs, and so we have a long way to go."" ""What our plan says is let's keep the economy going. Let's see more job creation -- that's a really good thing for the economy,"" Deese said. ""But let's also think to the longer-term about where those investments [are] that we can make that will really drive not just more job growth, but better job growth. Not just job growth in the short term, but job growth in the long term by investing in our infrastructure. By investing in our research and development in a way that we haven't since the 1960s."" Deese, a former senior adviser to former President Barack Obama, played a leading role in trying to get the president's $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package across the finish line. He said in January that he aimed to help get Republicans on board with the plan, but no GOP members of Congress voted for it. Now Biden is pushing a $2 trillion-plus spending package, which is billed largely as an infrastructure bill but addresses many issues beyond crumbling highways and bridges. That's drawn harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, many of whom have lined up to oppose the president's plan. ""This plan is not about rebuilding America’s backbone. Less than 6% of this massive proposal goes to roads and bridges,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said last week. ""It would spend more money just on electric cars than on America’s roads, bridges, ports, airports, and waterways combined."" Indeed, the White House's summary of the American Jobs Plan says it will spend ""$115 billion to modernize the bridges, highways roads and main streets that are in most critical need of repair"" out of the total $2.2 trillion. McConnell's definition ignores other elements of the plan that address infrastructure, including broadband, pipes and schools. But in all, Biden's plan still directs well under half of its funding to priorities that are not infrastructure, a  . Wallace challenged Deese on whether the bulk of the Biden spending plan, which the White House is selling as an infrastructure bill, is actually for infrastructure. Deese argued that there needs to be a broader definition of infrastructure for the modern world. ""I think we really need to update what we mean by infrastructure for the 21st century,"" he said. ""If you look at that number on housing, what we're talking about is construction, building housing all around the country to help make sure that there are more affordable housing units for people to access jobs and access economic opportunity."" Deese added: ""We're talking about construction to build things like VA [Veterans Administration] facilities, our schools and community colleges -- putting people to work, construction work that really needs to be done to meet commitments that we have to our veterans and others. ""We believe that the infrastructure of our care economy is something to take very seriously,"" Dees also said, referencing the $400 billion in the Biden spending plan for home care for elderly and disabled people. ""For anybody out there... who are parents who are taking care of an elderly parent or an adult child with disabilities, they know that if you don't have an infrastructure of care to support your loved ones, you can't effectively work, you can't effectively interact in the 21st century economy."" Wallace also asked Deese how much the president is willing to come down from his initial $2 trillion-plus proposal, in light of Biden and other administration officials suggesting they would be open to working with Republicans to pass an infrastructure bill. But Biden and his officials made a similar suggestion on coronavirus relief, only to ultimately circumvent Republicans and avoid substantive negotiations.  ""Some people have said it's too much, some people have said it's too little,"" Deese said of the spending package. ""We want to have this conversation. We're starting this outreach already."" But Deese added that ""we're not going to negotiate that on this show,"" as he refused to provide any benchmarks for how much the president is actually willing to compromise.  Biden is expected later this month to outline a second massive spending bill, focused this time largely on the social safety net."

Democrats still searching for answers on Trump's appeal to Latinos in 2020 election,politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/trump-latino-2020-election-democrats-conservative,"Former President   appeal to   voters may have been more widespread than originally thought, according to new research. Democrats touted their focus on increasing turnout among minority voters for the 2020 elections, but Latino voters with low involvement in politics shifted toward Trump, according a new   from Equis Labs, which describes itself as focused on the ""Latinx community."" ""Trump gains seemed to be unique among those identifying as Latino across geography and place of origin,"" the researchers wrote. Trump also ""galvanized"" conservative Latinas, while liberal Latinas lost enthusiasm about voting, according to the report. Democrat-linked Equis Labs offered various theories about why Trump appealed to Latino voters, including ""dog whistle politics & racial status anxiety"" and ""activation around religion, SCOTUS and QAnon."" ""Neither party should assume that a Hispanic voter who cast a ballot for Trump in 2020 is locked in as a Republican going forward,"" the researchers wrote. ""Nor can we assume this shift was exclusive to Trump and will revert back on its own."" Trump's increased support from Latino voters in 2020 to 2016 was not enough to win him the election, however. President Biden won Latinos by a roughly two-to-one margin, while Trump had the support of roughly one in three, according to  . The Trump campaign was   the Biden campaign on Spanish-language ads in the run-up to the election. Nearly 17 million Latinos voted in the 2020 general election, a more than 30% increase compared to 2016, according to UCLA Latino Policy & Politics Initiative data cited by  ."
Kansas GOP ends state's mask mandate hours after Dem governor extended it,politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/kansas-gop-ends-states-mask-mandate-hours-after-dem-governor-extended-it,"Republican lawmakers in   voted to end Gov. Laura Kelly’s short-lived statewide  mask mandate extension last week under a new law that allows legislators to repeal the governor’s executive orders, according to reports. The governor, a Democrat, had prolonged the mandate through May 28 but the state's Legislative Coordinating Council voted 5-2 along party lines to cancel it just hours later in a party line, the Kansas City Star reported. The mandate has been in place off and on since last summer.  Republican Speaker Pro Tem Blaine Finch said the revocation of the ""one-size-fits-all statewide mandate"" won't impact local orders. ""The numbers don’t support a statewide mandate at this time,"" he said.  Counties in Kansas could opt out of the statewide mandate and a new law that rewrote the state’s emergency powers law gives the Legislative Coordinating Council the power to repeal Kelly’s executive orders. The governor signed the bill into law last month. In a joint statement, Finch and Kansas House Speaker Ron Ryckman, a Republican, said health mandates should be ""short-term, data-driven and reserved only for pressing emergency situations."" ""They should not be used to dictate Kansans’ daily lives year after year,"" the statement said according to   in Salina, Kansas.  Kelly said in a statement she was ""disappointed"" that Republican leaders are ""more motivated by political publicity stunts than working together to protect Kansans and our economy."" She said she understands people want to get back to normal, but stressed the importance of wearing masks to ""help protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our neighbors from the new COVID-19 strains that are wreaking havoc in other states."" Kansas is now among 17 states without a mask mandate, according to the  . "
Biden holds first call with Ukrainian president amid Russian 'aggression' in the region,politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/biden-holds-first-call-with-ukrainian-president-amid-russian-aggression-in-the-region," spoke with  President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday in their first conversation since Biden took office. The phone call came amid what the   has called escalations of  "" in   where Ukrainian forces have been fighting Russian-backed separatists since 2014.    Biden ""affirmed the United States’ unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia’s ongoing aggression in the Donbas and Crimea,"" a White House readout of the call said.  The president reiterated his support for the U.S.’s ""strategic partnership"" with Ukraine and of Zelensky’s anti-corruption agenda ""based on our shared democratic values that delivers justice, security, and prosperity to the people of Ukraine,"" the White House added. Before Biden’s call, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other top U.S. officials had spoken with their Ukrainian counterparts about the issue in at least three calls, according to Politico. Blinken expressed the administration's ""unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia's ongoing aggression"" in the region during one of the calls, the State Department said. Ukraine had pushed for the call with Biden for weeks as a show of support against Russia, Politico reported. The Russian escalations include violations of a July 2020 ceasefire, brokered by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, that led to the deaths of four Ukrainian soldiers in the eastern part of the country on March 26 and the wounding of two others, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said. The Ukrainian military said the four were killed in a mortar attack it blamed on Russian troops. Russia denies having a military presence in the region. The State Department said Blinken expressed condolences for the losses.  ""Russia's destabilizing actions undermine the de-escalation in tensions that had been achieved through an OSCE-brokered agreement back in July of last year,"" Kirby said of the reported hundreds of ceasefire violations in recent days. ""Additionally, we are aware of Ukrainian military reports concerning Russian troop movements on Ukraine's borders.""  The Biden administration has approved $125 million in lethal aid to Ukraine recently for defense against Russia, according to  .  Before the 2020 election, then-President Trump accused Biden of abusing his office when he was vice president in forcing the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor to help his son Hunter Biden who was on the board of Ukrainian oil company Burisma at the time. No evidence of wrongdoing has been found.  Trump himself was accused of asking Zelensky to investigate the Bidens during a July 2019 phone call, which led to his first impeachment in 2019 as it seemed likely Biden would be his political opponent. He was acquitted in February 2020.  The White House   of Biden’s call with Zelensky added the two leaders also discussed the ""importance of close United States-Ukraine cooperation to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthen democracy in the region."""
