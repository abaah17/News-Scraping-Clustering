bipartisan misunderstand whether make easier harder vote especially mail significant effect turnout electoral outcomes the evidence suggest not the fight new georgia election law latest example that law condemn democrats voter suppression tantamount jim crow democrats understandably concern provision empower republicancontrolled state legislature play larger role election administration that provision uncertain potentially substantial effect depend legislature might future and its possible law intend exactly progressives fear reshape electorate advantage republicans soon electoral defeat make harder vote and yet laws vote provision unlikely significantly affect turnout democratic chance it could plausibly increase turnout in final account probably hard say whether effect turnout all the bill major effect boil point if leave aside administrative provision question intent core question voter suppression extent reduce vote options like early vote runoffs mail vote general reduce turnout democratic chance for decades reformers assume way increase turnout make vote easier yet surprisingly expand vote options make convenient hasnt seem huge effect turnout electoral outcomes thats find decades political science research vote one prominent study find early vote though thats bite outlier theres essentially evidence vast expansion noexcuse absentee mail vote anyone apply mail absentee ballot discernible effect turnout 2020 that shouldnt huge surprise even universal vote mail every register voter automatically send mail ballot as oppose every voter opportunity apply one increase turnout discernible partisan advantage believe not turnout increase much state didnt noexcuse absentee vote state add first time similarly joe biden improve hillary clintons performance three percentage point state add it compare 29 point state not a political scientists stanford find noexcuse mail vote might increase turnout whop 002 percent 2020 election the study use novel approach the researchers compare turnout among 65yearolds texas eligible vote mail without excuse 64yearolds texas werent the turnout among 64yearolds indistinguishable 65yearolds though latter group vote mail large number like georgia texas require identification vote mail strict id requirement inperson vote the partisan makeup electorate didnt appear change either the democratic share voters appear tick twotenths percentage point enough decide close election but its also small could statistical noise effect all social science methods dont offer level precision necessary nail whether this any change might move needle tenth point the georgia law doesnt come anywhere close eliminate noexcuse absentee vote unlike political scientists test texas as result might expect new law smaller effect you could make counterintuitive argument make absentee vote harder worse democrats eliminate altogether democrats might better discourage people mail vote avoid unnecessary ballot rejections people could successfully vote person the georgia runoff elections hardly scientific case study nonetheless offer another useful example there fewer opportunities vote advance compare general election shorter election campaign holiday season base dropoff early vote many analysts wind underestimate final turnout 20 percent more in end turnout exceed expectations the number election day voters higher general election many people might vote early werent christmas new years day turn election day maybe runoff turnout would higher early vote opportunities general but maybe not and none discernible negative effect democrats course better general how possible something like eliminate noexcuse absentee mail vote method beloved millions voters wouldnt materially affect turnout election result one simple answer often assume almost everyone care enough vote brave inconvenience inperson vote so whether thats inconvenience arent great care enough suffer them this suppose certain reasonable level convenience course sixhour line would change calculation many voters and indeed turnout it also suppose certain level interest someone might think theres way im wait halfhour line vote dogcatcher similarly importance convenient vote option probably grow significance race decrease the implication though nearly every person manage vote sufficiently convenient options available prefer option doesnt exist that make georgia election laws effort curb long line potentially quite significant not might mitigate already limit effect restrict mail vote might outweigh it another reason convenience vote may convenient lowerturnout voters essentially decide overall turnout lowturnout voters probably arent think theyll vote month ahead election theyll need apply absentee ballot someone think probably highturnout voter lowturnout voters might know election day theyll support and make less likely advantage advance vote options like noexcuse early vote require think election early often submit application fill ballot return it as result convenience vote methods tend favor highturnout voters the methods ensure every highinterest voter many opportunities vote without quite much draw less engage voters poll a final reason vote restrictions may backfire anger energize democratic voters this laws restrictions hand water line instance may mobilize democrats stop vote one recent study theorize supreme court decision roll back elements vote right act subsequent efforts restrict vote swiftly counter efforts mobilize black voters that doesnt mean georgia law laws without consequence many make vote difficult enough intimidate discourage voters many outright disenfranchise voters small number perhaps disenfranchisement single voter merit outrage opposition especially law pass dubious fabricate ground jim crow mass disenfranchisement historical backdrop but set aside intent mean many vote provision like georgia unlikely huge effect turnout democratic chance there consequences misunderstand stake change vote laws minor change vote access overshadow larger issue include kinds potentially significant provision georgia law empower state legislature the democracy reform bill hr 1 instance would quite bite expand vote access relatively little protect partisan interference election administration the perception vote laws existential stake democracy political

art ,https://www.nytimes.com/es/2021/04/04/espanol/amor-final.html,comenzó con un mensaje de facebook de un chico al que había conocido superficialmente en los comedores de la escuela primaria por los pasillos de nuestra secundaria el evento principal la clase de baile del séptimo grado en nuestro colegio la clase de baile era un horror especial porque los profesores nos emparejaban lo que al menos habría reducido la ansiedad en cambio los chicos se les decía que eligieran una chica una experiencia humillante para las que eran elegidas hasta el final lo eran en el séptimo grado yo ya medía 180 metros era la chica más alta de toda mi generación más alta que casi todos los chicos lo que ponía en riesgo de estar entre las elegidas pues bien él eligió mí aunque apenas nos conocíamos aquella clase de baile fue nuestro único encuentro significativo del que cada uno salió creyendo que el otro había sido el salvador ahora ya éramos niños en edad escolar teníamos 27 años y aquí de la nada llegaba un mensaje de facebook de él recordando el trauma de que nos obligaran aprender bail de salón durante nuestros años más incómodos la ansiedad de estar alineados contra la par esperando ver si alguien nos elegía si nos asignaban al azar para unirnos otra pareja cuando los números cuadraban el alivio de una cara amigable para hacer la experiencia un poco menos angustiosa tal vez solo debía ser eso un momento de gratitud por ser la cara amigable del otro pero lo fue empezamos hablar más sobre cómo estaban nuestras vidas ahora hacia dónde nos dirigíamos cómo él acabó mudándose australia mis plan de dar el salto fuera de estados unidos al año siguiente cuando le dije que sabía cómo iba llevar mi carrera al extranjero envió una decena de ideas diferentes cuando le dije que quería perderme los hitos que tendría mi familia bodas bebés etcétera argumentó que esos hitos nunca tienen fecha de caducidad vuelves para lo importante cuando suspiré por la posibilidad de obtener un visado envió información sobre todos los lugares los que podía aplicar ánimos sobre lo mucho que valdría la pena me quitó todas las excusas en ese momento tenía nadie en mi vida que entendiera el camino poco convencional que quería tomar había más gente que tiraba de la manga diciéndome que aguantara al menos hasta la última despedida de soltera hasta el próximo ascenso o según mi entonces compañero de piso solo un año más de renta él fue el primero en llamarme la atención por procrastinar y tal vez solo debía ser eso una chispa de inspiración de alguien que estaba haciendo lo que yo quería hacer animaba seguir mis propios sueños pero lo fue él iba volver estados unidos en unas semanas estaría en chicago así que decidimos organizarnos para tomar algo recuperar los viejos tiempos que nunca compartimos tomó el tren al centro de la ciudad desde la casa de sus padres en los suburbios su madre lo había hecho cambiarse de camisa tomar un tren más temprano para que llegara tarde mi encuentro nos sentamos en un bar pedimos muestras de cervezas artesanales él siguió regañadientes mis reglas que consistían en beber un sorbo de cada cerveza votar por nuestras favoritas hablamos de su vida en australia de sus plan de ir nueva zelanda luego la antártida irlanda noruega alemania luego las islas malvinas me dio más consejos parecía genuinamente emocionado por mí una rara apuesta de un tipo que pesar de haber estado en el mismo grado en la niñez en la misma clase de baile básicamente era un extraño me di cuenta de que relajaba cuando estaba con él de que podía ser yo misma sin consecuencias y tal vez solo debía ser eso una minirreunión de exalumnos de la escuela secundaria pero lo fue lo dejé en la estación de tren diciéndole que volviera casa sano salvo mientras él devolvía un sí señora muy amigable yo deseaba que hubiera intentado besarme casi fue algo una semana unos cuantos mensajes coquetos después decidimos vernos una última vez ante de que volviera su vida en australia volvió venir en tren salimos tomar unas copas hablamos luego más copas más charla esta vez quedé con ganas de más en el andén se quedó dormir pasamos una noche estupenda una noche perfecta una noche espontánea sin expectativas ni confusión de las primeras citas ni tiempo para pensar demasiado en las cosas fue cómoda natural simplemente sucedió y tal vez solo debía ser eso una aventura de una sola noche pero lo fue seguí esperando el momento en que él siguiera adelante con su vida volvió australia ahora estábamos intentando mantener el contacto pesar de una enorme diferencia horaria nunca se prometió nada más cuánto tiempo tardaría él en aburrirse los hombres con los que salía siempre se daban por vencidos los do meses normalmente cuando decían haber conocido alguien más pero con este hombre pasaron do meses luego seis luego nueve seguíamos hablando casi todos los días nunca de una manera que apuntara una relación seria pero ciertamente como algo más que amigos ahora conocía su plan de 15 años sus pensamientos sobre el matrimonio sus relaciones pasadas cómo pasaba los veranos en la granja su destreza poética su odio irracional la película él conocía mi sueño de dejar mi trabajo viajar por el mundo mi obsesión por la música deprimente cada frase que hacía sonrojar sentí que esto podría ser algo de verdad sentía que tal vez solo tal vez se estaba convirtiendo en algo esperaba que algún día tuviéramos la oportunidad de averiguarlo un año más tarde en febrero de 2020 volvimos vernos en persona en un hotel de chicago una parada ante de que su siguiente contrato lo enviara otro lugar muy lejano esta vez había expectativas confusión mucho tiempo para pensar al menos por mi parte pero una vez que estuvimos juntos sumergí de nuevo en ese espacio cómodo no perdimos tiempo nos metimos en la cama solo salimos de la habitación para encontrarnos con el repartidor de comida en el vestíbulo cuando decidimos irnos dormir él dejaba de comprobar si ya había dormido quería evitar quedarse dormido mientras yo estaba despierta en parte sabía que estaba comprobando si estaba en condiciones de alejarse para dormir pues tiene el calor corporal de un oso al principio le había dicho en una llamada que entendía que los abrazos empiezan sofocar muy rápido pero que mí encanta ir de la mano casi pude ver cómo volteaba los ojos al otro lado del teléfono aquella noche fingí estar dormida durante uno de sus chequeos así que di cuenta cuando se separó de mí luego tanteó bajo las sábanas hasta que encontró mi mano la sostuvo durante el resto de la noche unas semanas más tarde el mundo vivía el confinamiento de covid19 él se fue nueva york trabajar como enfermero nuestra comunicación empezó ser irregular ya que pasaba muchas horas en un trabajo tan intenso que soy incapaz de entender y así pasaron los meses en los que yo intentaba caminar la línea que separa los mensajes alegres los molestos él respondía amablemente de vez en cuando y entonces ocurrió el momento que había estado anticipando durante los primeros do meses luego seis luego nueve conoció alguien más alguien con quien estaba realmente entusiasmado con quien podía verse viajando por el mundo tratando de formar una relación de verdad así de fácil estaba de vuelta en la estación de tren viéndolo alejarse preguntándome si esto era todo lo que debía ser otro casi algo desde el principio había intentado moderar mis expectativas diciéndome mí misma que había un 99999 por ciento de posibilidades de que terminara exactamente así que él conociera alguien más siguiera con su vida después de todo para mí nunca había ocurrido así y esta relación era más complicada desde el punto de vista logístico que cualquier otra que hubiera tenido ante pero ese 0001 por ciento de posibilidad nunca se había sentido tan posible y di permiso de entusiasmarme con él y tal vez eso es todo lo que debía ser algo que hiciera abrir realmente mi corazón de nuevo porque al final eso es todo lo que fue otro casi algo y ya estoy harta de los casi algo jessie mcnellis es una escritora que vive en chicago encuentra más ensayos de la sección modern love buscas más de modern
