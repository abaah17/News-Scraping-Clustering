              " 'theres nothing unusual exaggeration politics but comes debate voting rights something exaggeration going on theres real bipartisan misunderstanding whether making easier harder vote

depending legislature might future and its possible law intended exactly progressives fear reshape electorate advantage republicans soon electoral defeat making harder vote and yet laws voting provisions unlikely significantly affect turnout democratic chances it could plausibly increase turnout in final account probably hard say whether effect turnout all the bills major effects boiled points if leave aside administrative provisions question intent core question voter suppression extent reducing voting options like early voting runoffs mail voting general reduce turnout democratic chances for decades reformers assumed way increase turnout make voting easier yet surprisingly expanding voting options make convenient hasnt seemed huge effect turnout electoral outcomes thats finding decades political science research voting one prominent study found early voting though thats bit outlier theres essentially evidence vast expansion noexcuse absentee mail voting anyone apply mail absentee ballot discernible effect turnout 2020 that shouldnt huge surprise even universal vote mail every registered voter automatically sent mail ballot as opposed every voter opportunity apply one increases turnout discernible partisan advantage believe not turnout increased much states didnt noexcuse absentee voting states added first time similarly joe biden improved hillary clintons performance three percentage points states added it compared 29 points states not a political scientists stanford found noexcuse mail voting might increased turnout whopping 002 percent 2020 election the study used novel approach the researchers compared turnout among 65yearolds texas eligible vote mail without excuse 64yearolds texas werent the turnout among 64yearolds indistinguishable 65yearolds though latter group voted mail large numbers like georgia texas require identification vote mail strict id requirement inperson voting the partisan makeup electorate didnt appear change either the democratic share voters appeared tick twotenths percentage point enough decide close election but its also small could statistical noise effect all social science methods dont offer level precision necessary nail whether this any change might move needle tenth point the georgia law doesnt come anywhere close eliminating noexcuse absentee voting unlike political scientists tested texas as result might expect new law smaller effect you could make counterintuitive argument making absentee voting harder worse democrats eliminating altogether democrats might better discouraging people mail voting avoid unnecessary ballot rejections people could successfully voted person the georgia runoff elections hardly scientific case study nonetheless offer another useful example there fewer opportunities vote advance compared general election shorter election campaign holiday season based dropoff early voting many analysts wound underestimating final turnout 20 percent more in end turnout exceeded expectations the number election day voters higher general election many people might voted early werent christmas new years day turned election day maybe runoff turnout would higher early voting opportunities general but maybe not and none discernible negative effect democrats course better general how possible something like eliminating noexcuse absentee mail voting method beloved millions voters wouldnt materially affect turnout election results one simple answer often assumed almost everyone cares enough vote brave inconveniences inperson voting so whether thats inconveniences arent great care enough suffer them this supposes certain reasonable level convenience course sixhour lines would change calculation many voters and indeed turnout it also supposes certain level interest someone might think theres way im waiting halfhour line vote dogcatcher similarly importance convenient voting option probably grows significance race decreases the implication though nearly every person manage vote sufficiently convenient options available preferred option doesnt exist that makes georgia election laws effort curb long lines potentially quite significant not might mitigate already limited effect restricting mail voting might outweigh it another reason convenience voting may convenient lowerturnout voters essentially decide overall turnout lowturnout voters probably arent thinking theyll vote month ahead election theyll need apply absentee ballot someone thinking probably highturnout voter lowturnout voters might know election day theyll support and makes less likely advantage advance voting options like noexcuse early voting requires think election early often submit application fill ballot return it as result convenience voting methods tend favoring highturnout voters the methods ensure every highinterest voter many opportunities vote without quite much draw less engaged voters polls a final reason voting restrictions may backfire angering energizing democratic voters this laws restrictions handing water line instance may mobilize democrats stop voting one recent study theorized supreme courts decision roll back elements voting rights act subsequent efforts restrict voting swiftly countered efforts mobilize black voters that doesnt mean georgia law laws without consequence many make voting difficult enough intimidate discourage voters many outright disenfranchise voters small numbers perhaps disenfranchisement single voter merits outrage opposition especially law passed dubious fabricated grounds jim crow mass disenfranchisement historical backdrop but setting aside intent mean many voting provisions like georgia unlikely huge effect turnout democratic chances there consequences misunderstanding stakes changing voting laws minor changes voting access overshadow larger issues including kinds potentially significant provisions georgia law empower state legislature the democracy reform bill hr 1

              " 'comenzó con un mensaje de facebook de un chico al que había conocido superficialmente en los comedores de la escuela primaria por los pasillos de nuestra secundaria el evento principal la clase de baile del séptimo grado en nuestro colegio la clase de baile era un horror especial porque los profesores nos emparejaban lo que al menos habría reducido la ansiedad en cambio los chicos se les decía que eligieran una chica una experiencia humillante para las que eran elegidas hasta el final lo eran en el séptimo grado yo ya medía 180 metros era la chica más alta de toda mi generación más alta que casi todos los chicos lo que ponía en riesgo de estar entre las elegidas pues bien él eligió mí aunque apenas nos conocíamos aquella clase de baile fue nuestro único encuentro significativo del que cada uno salió creyendo que el otro había sido el salvador ahora ya éramos niños en edad escolar teníamos 27 años y aquí de la nada llegaba un mensaje de facebook de él recordando el trauma de que nos obligaran aprender bailes de salón durante nuestros años más incómodos la ansiedad de estar alineados contra la pared esperando ver si alguien nos elegía si nos asignaban al azar para unirnos otra pareja cuando los números cuadraban el alivio de una cara amigable para hacer la experiencia un poco menos angustiosa tal vez solo debía ser eso un momento de gratitud por ser la cara amigable del otro pero lo fue empezamos hablar más sobre cómo estaban nuestras vidas ahora hacia dónde nos dirigíamos cómo él acabó mudándose australia mis planes de dar el salto fuera de estados unidos al año siguiente cuando le dije que sabía cómo iba llevar mi carrera al extranjero envió una decena de ideas diferentes cuando le dije que quería perderme los hitos que tendría mi familia bodas bebés etcétera argumentó que esos hitos nunca tienen fecha de caducidad vuelves para lo importante cuando suspiré por la posibilidad de obtener un visado envió información sobre todos los lugares los que podía aplicar ánimos sobre lo mucho que valdría la pena me quitó todas las excusas en ese momento tenía nadie en mi vida que entendiera el camino poco convencional que quería tomar había más gente que tiraba de la manga diciéndome que aguantara al menos hasta la última despedida de soltera hasta el próximo ascenso o según mi entonces compañero de piso solo un año más de renta él fue el primero en llamarme la atención por procrastinar y tal vez solo debía ser eso una chispa de inspiración de alguien que estaba haciendo lo que yo quería hacer animaba seguir mis propios sueños pero lo fue él iba volver estados unidos en unas semanas estaría en chicago así que decidimos organizarnos para tomar algo recuperar los viejos tiempos que nunca compartimos tomó el tren al centro de la ciudad desde la casa de sus padres en los suburbios su madre lo había hecho cambiarse de camisa tomar un tren más temprano para que llegara tarde mi encuentro nos sentamos en un bar pedimos muestras de cervezas artesanales él siguió regañadientes mis reglas que consistían en beber un sorbo de cada cerveza votar por nuestras favoritas hablamos de su vida en australia de sus planes de ir nueva zelanda luego la antártida irlanda noruega alemania luego las islas malvinas me dio más consejos parecía genuinamente emocionado por mí una rara apuesta de un tipo que pesar de haber estado en el mismo grado en la niñez en la misma clase de baile básicamente era un extraño me di cuenta de que relajaba cuando estaba con él de que podía ser yo misma sin consecuencias y tal vez solo debía ser eso una minirreunión de exalumnos de la escuela secundaria pero lo fue lo dejé en la estación de tren diciéndole que volviera casa sano salvo mientras él devolvía un sí señora muy amigable yo deseaba que hubiera intentado besarme casi fue algo una semana unos cuantos mensajes coquetos después decidimos vernos una última vez antes de que volviera su vida en australia volvió venir en tren salimos tomar unas copas hablamos luego más copas más charla esta vez quedé con ganas de más en el andén se quedó dormir pasamos una noche estupenda una noche perfecta una noche espontánea sin expectativas ni confusión de las primeras citas ni tiempo para pensar demasiado en las cosas fue cómoda natural simplemente sucedió y tal vez solo debía ser eso una aventura de una sola noche pero lo fue seguí esperando el momento en que él siguiera adelante con su vida volvió australia ahora estábamos intentando mantener el contacto pesar de una enorme diferencia horaria nunca se prometió nada más cuánto tiempo tardaría él en aburrirse los hombres con los que salía siempre se daban por vencidos los dos meses normalmente cuando decían haber conocido alguien más pero con este hombre pasaron dos meses luego seis luego nueve seguíamos hablando casi todos los días nunca de una manera que apuntara una relación seria pero ciertamente como algo más que amigos ahora conocía su plan de 15 años sus pensamientos sobre el matrimonio sus relaciones pasadas cómo pasaba los veranos en la granja su destreza poética su odio irracional la película él conocía mi sueño de dejar mi trabajo viajar por el mundo mi obsesión por la música deprimente cada frase que hacía sonrojar sentí que esto podría ser algo de verdad sentía que tal vez solo tal vez se estaba convirtiendo en algo esperaba que algún día tuviéramos la oportunidad de averiguarlo un año más tarde en febrero de 2020 volvimos vernos en persona en un hotel de chicago una parada antes de que su siguiente contrato lo enviara otro lugar muy lejano esta vez había expectativas confusión mucho tiempo para pensar al menos por mi parte pero una vez que estuvimos juntos sumergí de nuevo en ese espacio cómodo no perdimos tiempo nos metimos en la cama solo salimos de la habitación para encontrarnos con el repartidor de comida en el vestíbulo cuando decidimos irnos dormir él dejaba de comprobar si ya había dormido quería evitar quedarse dormido mientras yo estaba despierta en parte sabía que estaba comprobando si estaba en condiciones de alejarse para dormir pues tiene el calor corporal de un oso al principio le había dicho en una llamada que entendía que los abrazos empiezan sofocar muy rápido pero que mí encanta ir de la mano casi pude ver cómo volteaba los ojos al otro lado del teléfono aquella noche fingí estar dormida durante uno de sus chequeos así que di cuenta cuando se separó de mí luego tanteó bajo las sábanas hasta que encontró mi mano la sostuvo durante el resto de la noche unas semanas más tarde el mundo vivía el confinamiento de covid19 él se fue nueva york trabajar como enfermero nuestra comunicación empezó ser irregular ya que pasaba muchas horas en un trabajo tan intenso que soy incapaz de entender y así pasaron los meses en los que yo intentaba caminar la línea que separa los mensajes alegres los molestos él respondía amablemente de vez en cuando y entonces ocurrió el momento que había estado anticipando durante los primeros dos meses luego seis luego nueve conoció alguien más alguien con quien estaba realmente entusiasmado con quien podía verse viajando por el mundo tratando de formar una relación de verdad así de fácil estaba de vuelta en la estación de tren viéndolo alejarse preguntándome si esto era todo lo que debía ser otro casi algo desde el principio había intentado moderar mis expectativas diciéndome mí misma que había un 99999 por ciento de posibilidades de que terminara exactamente así que él conociera alguien más siguiera con su vida después de todo para mí nunca había ocurrido así y esta relación era más complicada desde el punto de vista logístico que cualquier otra que hubiera tenido antes pero ese 0001 por ciento de posibilidad nunca se había sentido tan posible y di permiso de entusiasmarme con él y tal vez eso es todo lo que debía ser algo que hiciera abrir realmente mi corazón de nuevo porque al final eso es todo lo que fue otro casi algo y ya estoy harta de los casi algo jessie mcnellis es una escritora que vive en chicago encuentra más ensayos de la sección modern love buscas más de modern love puedes ver la
